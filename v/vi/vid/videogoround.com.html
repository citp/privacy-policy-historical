      <p><small><font face="Verdana">VideoGoRound.com strives to offer its
      visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an
      interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally
      Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address,
      telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will
      never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third
      party. Period.</font></small></p>

      </b><p><b><small><font face="Verdana">How we gather information from users</font></small></b></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">How we collect and store information
      depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to
      participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to
      provide information when you register for access to certain portions of
      our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make
      a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in
      sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other
      interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, VideoGoRound.com also
      collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools
      that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name
      of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize
      you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie
      may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter
      that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times
      you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we
      adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other
      means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
      information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept
      cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the
      site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may
      not be able to customize the site’s features according to your
      preferences.</font></small></p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><small><font face="Verdana">What we do with the information we collect</font></small></b></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">Like other Web publishers, we collect
      information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content
      and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information
      with anyone.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">Aggregated Information (information that
      does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example,
      we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar
      information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and
      services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are
      most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with
      our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not
      include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone
      to identify you individually.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">We may use Personally Identifiable
      Information collected on VideoGoRound.com to communicate with you about
      your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and
      privacy policy; services and products offered by VideoGoRound.com and other
      topics we think you might find of interest. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">Personally Identifiable Information
      collected by VideoGoRound.com may also be used for other purposes,
      including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting,
      processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and
      contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who
      provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting
      service for example) may access such information. We will use your
      information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we
      continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
      other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may
      be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in
      response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are
      reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of
      amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever
      we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you
      with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</font></small></p>
