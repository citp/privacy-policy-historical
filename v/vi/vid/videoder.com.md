When you’re not signed in to Videoder using your Youtube Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across sessions.

When you’re signed in Videoder using Youtube account, we also collect certain information attached to your Youtube account. We collect your email address, your name, and your profile picture, in addition to basic information like location and language collected irrespective of signing in.

All the personal sensitive information like email address are stored in their encrypted/hashed forms on our servers.

For example storing screen size information helps us show only those videos in suggestions that are best suited for the device. Location information helps us target local region videos in user’s feed.

Like any other popular application, Videoder uses a lot of third party SDKs to provide many functionalities. For example Videoder uses many ad network SDKs to provide in app ads for revenue. **  We do not explicitly provide any private information to any of these third party SDK.**

Since these SDKs are bundled with the application and have access to all the permissions granted to Videoder, many of them collect information for identifying users and then targeting them with relevant content. For example Ad networks SDKs generally collect coarse location to better target users with relevant local ads. We at Videoder have made sure that all the SDKs we use in our app are legally compliant with Privacy laws across the globe, including the new GDPR implemented in EU region. The sdks included in the application and links to their privacy policies are provided below :
