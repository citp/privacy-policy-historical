# Privacy Policy - VideoGuys.com

For more than 30 years, Videoguys.com / The Electronic Mailbox has worked hard to build relationships with our customers based on respect and integrity. We're aware of the trust and confidence you demonstrate when you visit our website and provide us with information. We promise that we will treat your information with the same honesty and sensitivity that we have displayed throughout our company's history.

Our goal has always been to provide the best customer service and support in the industry. In addition to our 30-day money back guarantee and availability to free tech support we are constantly utilizing new technology to better meet your needs. Some of these new features like the monthly e-newsletters and the Videoguys' Forums require your personal information. After all, we couldn't e-mail you the latest news without your e-mail address and it's nice to read a post from someone who has an identity. Another obvious time when you will be asked to share your personal information is when you are ready to place an order in which case billing, shipping and financial information must be collected to fulfill your request. The question this privacy policy addresses is "What will we do with that information?"

We will NEVER share your financial information with anyone other the banks whose authorization is necessary to approve the order. Every credit card number provided to our company will be treated as if it was our own whether it is provided over the phone or by using our secure online order system. Our website protects the security of your personal information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We do not reveal your credit card number when we confirm your order.

When you place your order and/or when you request that we send you information we may share your name and mailing address with a few carefully selected marketing partners. We may also provide some of our vendors with your contact information so that they may contact you directly for product support, tech bulletins and upgrade information. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most from your purchase and your relationship with us. If you would prefer that we do not share the information just tell your salesperson or complete any of the simple unsubscribe requests included with every correspondence.

If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy please call us toll-free at:1-800-323-2325; e-mail us at videoguy@videoguys.com; or send a letter to: Videoguys, 10-12 Charles Street, Glen Cove, NY 11542.
