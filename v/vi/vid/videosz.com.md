» LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only where: 

  * We have your consent to do so,
  * We need the personal information to perform a contract with you,
  * The processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights or, 
  * We have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you.



" _Legitimate interests_ " means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/products and the best and most secure experience. For example: we have an interest in keeping our network secure. It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well. For example: we may process your Personal Information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our website. We process Personal Information for certain legitimate business purposes, which include some or all of the following: 

  * To enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services/communications for the benefit of our customers,
  * To identify and prevent fraud,
  * To enhance the security of our network and information systems.



When processing your Personal Information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights under the data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted by law). If you have any concerns about the processing, you have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests. For more information on your rights, please see "Your Rights" section below. 

» CHOICE

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to us. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of the Sites, but you will be unable to purchase a product or service online, setup an account with us and/or use any of our other paid Services. If you choose to have a relationship with us, such as a contractual or other business relationship, you will be required to provide Personal Information in connection with such relationship. 

From time to time, we may send our users e-mail or other notices regarding new services, promotions, or other information which may be of general interest. Users who no longer wish to receive materials from us may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe link’ or by contacting us. 

» ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ONWARD TRANSFER

When we transfer Personal Information to a third party we will ensure that our agreement with the third party provides that such Personal Information may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent you provided and that the third party will provide the same level of protection as the Privacy Shield Principles and will notify us if it determines that it can no longer meet this obligation. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield or Swiss-US Privacy Shield respectively, we are potentially liable. 

» SECURITY

The Sites are all using SSL 128-bit encryption for any form where you enter any data. All of your data is also stored securely. We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the information you have provided to us from unauthorized access by using encryption and other security measures. We have adopted and implemented industry standard technology for maintaining the security of all personal information collected by our websites. While we use commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to secure your personal information, the transmission of information via the Internet can never be one hundred percent secure. As a result, we can assume no liability if information relating to any subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient. We encourage you to contact us if you are interested in learning more about our security measures. 

» DATA INTEGRITY & PURPOSE LIMITATION

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information that we collect is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use and purpose which may include those that reasonably serve payment processing, customer relations, compliance and legal considerations, auditing, security and fraud prevention, preserving or defending our legal rights or other reasonable uses in this context. 

You may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable. We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as it is necessary for purposes as identified above.
