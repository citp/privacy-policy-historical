<br>
Pinnacle's websites may contain links to other websites. Pinnacle assumes no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies and practices of such websites. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Pinnacle of those linked-to websites.  You acknowledge that Pinnacle is providing these links to you only as a convenience.

<br>
<br>
<p class="lgBoldTextBlack">What Personally Identifiable Information We Collect.</p>
Pinnacle may ask to you to register or provide Personally Identifiable Information (such as your name, e-mail address and mailing address) when you visit certain areas of our website, register a product, download software, request information, or subscribe to a newsletter.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle contracts with a third party to provide you with the eStore.  That third party collects Personally Identifiable Information (including credit card information) when you make a purchase through the Pinnacle eStore, and shares some of that information with Pinnacle.  Please review the <a href="http://buy.pinnaclesys.com/dr/v2/ec_MAIN.Entry11?SP=10345&amp;PN=1&amp;xid=51106" class="emphasizeLink">eStore privacy policy</a> before using the eStore.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle's technical and customer support representatives may collect information such as your name, email address and phone number, as well as technical information regarding your computer and software from you in order to assist problem resolution and tracking.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle may sponsor or participate in sweepstakes, contests, or promotions.  Participation is voluntary, and you will be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in order to submit an entry.<br>
<br>
We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use clear gifs and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes information regarding number of visitors, pages visited, product codes and prices of purchased merchandise, etc.  This information is collected and reported in aggregated and non-personally identifiable form.  By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by setting your web browser not to accept cookies.  Doing so may slow or limit your access to some features of the site.<br>
<br>
<p class="lgBoldTextBlack">How We Store Your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server.  The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.  Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.<br>
<br>
<p class="lgBoldTextBlack">How We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
Pinnacle Systems is a division of Avid Technology, Inc. ("Avid"), which is based in the United States. In order to manage the information you give to us, we may transfer your information for storage and processing purposes to Avid servers located in the United States -- but only to be used in accordance with the terms of <a href="http://www.avid.com/legal/#privacy" class="emphasizeLink" target="_blank">Avid's privacy policy</a>.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle does not rent or sell any user-provided Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. Except as expressly set forth in this privacy policy, if we plan to share Personally Identifiable Information with another company, we will inform you at the time we ask for the information.  Pinnacle does not share user-provided Personally Identifiable Information with third parties if the user has opted not to receive information from other third parties or not to allow such disclosure. Pinnacle does not share any demographic information in a way that is personally identifiable.  Information may be used in the aggregate (separate from your Personally Identifiable Information) for our research and marketing.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle may share your Personally Identifiable Information with its third party service providers. We require our third party service providers to use your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this privacy policy and to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information only to their service providers who are similarly bound to comply with this privacy policy.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if necessary, in Pinnacle's good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant or order or to protect the rights of Pinnacle or others.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle protects users' Personally Identifiable Information by storing the information in a controlled, secure environment. Pinnacle occasionally hires other companies to provide services on our behalf, including order fulfillment, rebate administration and returns management. Pinnacle only provides those companies with the information they require to deliver the service and they are not permitted to use the information for any other purpose without your permission.<br>
<br>
<p class="lgBoldTextBlack">Your Options.</p>
When you provide Personally Identifiable Information through My Pinnacle you are given the opportunity to opt in or opt out of receiving information from Pinnacle and its affiliates and third party service providers.  If you do not opt out of receiving information from Pinnacle and its affiliates and third party service providers, Pinnacle and its affiliates and third party service providers may contact you to inform you of product updates and upgrades, special offers, new services and products, and other Pinnacle information.  Our emails and newsletters contain instructions for unsubscribing or opting out.  If you do not want Pinnacle or Pinnacle's affiliates and third party service providers to contact you, you may "opt out" at any time by following the instructions contained in the emails that you receive. You may also elect to "opt in" at a later point if you would like to have Pinnacle or its affiliates and third party service providers contact you. If you choose not to register or provide Personally Identifiable Information, you will still be able to view most Pinnacle websites, but you will not be able to access certain password protected and restricted areas that require registration.<br>
<br>
<p class="lgBoldTextBlack">Forums</p>
If you participate in our web forums, please remember that you do so at your own risk.  Any information you disclose in a forum posting will become public information.  Please review the <a href="http://webboard.pinnaclesys.com/disclaimer.asp?lng=1" class="emphasizeLink">Forums Terms of Use</a> before participation in a Forum.<br>
<br>
<p class="lgBoldTextBlack">Children</p>
While Pinnacle's web site may be viewed by children, we do not wish to receive data from children. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their children visit. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, Pinnacle's web site by visitors under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.<br>

<p class="lgBoldTextBlack">Notice to European Users</p>
Please note that the information you enter on this website or otherwise provide to Pinnacle, may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area, for purposes of processing, by Pinnacle, Avid Technology, Inc. its parent company located in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, U.S.A., or its subsidiaries or divisions, or authorized partners, located worldwide, including countries which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union, in order to provide this website and its services to you. In particular, you are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. You are further advised that the Council of the European Union has found that this model does not provide "adequate" privacy protections as contemplated by Article 25 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive. (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31)<br>
<br>
Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection.<br>
<br>
By agreeing to the <a href="/PublicSite/us/About+Us/Company+Info/Terms+of+Service.htm" class="emphasizeLink">Terms of Service</a> and this privacy policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States and other countries which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information as described in this privacy policy.
