	in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
	from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
	and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br>

	critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br><br>
