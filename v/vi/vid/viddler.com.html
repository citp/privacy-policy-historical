  <h3><a name="01">Summary of Privacy Policy</a></h3>
<p><em>This is a summary only. Please note that while our Privacy Policy may
change from time to time, you will always find the most recent version here.</em></p>

<p>We at Viddler recognize that you, our customers, visitors, users, and all
others who use Viddler.com value your privacy. We respect your privacy.</p>

<p>You choose the privacy settings for the content you upload (public, shared
or private.)</p>

<p>If you choose to share information publicly (such as in chats), you do so at
your own risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Remember, uploaded
content marked “public” can be viewed by anyone.</span></p>

<p>Some personal information is collected when you create an account. Viddler
may share non-personally identifiable aggregated demographic information.</p>

<p>We keep server logs to track usage, and may correlate this information with
personal information when required.</p>

<h4><a name="02">What This Privacy Policy Covers</a></h4>

<p>This Privacy Policy pertains to the use of the Viddler, Inc.
("Viddler") website at http://www.viddler.com/ which also includes
portions of the website that are co-branded or co-labeled with a third party
name or brand (the "Viddler Website" or the "Website").</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers how Viddler treats personal information that
Viddler collects and receives. Personal information is information about you
that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or
phone number.</p>

<p>Viddler reserves the right to review all User Content (as defined in our Terms
and Conditions) to verify quality and adherence to our Terms and Conditions. This
Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to our Terms and Conditions.
Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website remains
subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our <span class="s1">Terms and
Conditions. To the extent and provisions in the Privacy Policy conflict
with the <span class="s1">Terms and Conditions, the <span class="s1">Terms
and Conditions govern your use of this Website.</span></span></span></p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT BY USING THE VIDDLER WEBSITE OR SERVICE, OR BY VISITING THE
WEBSITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE
OR SERVICE.</p>

<h4><a name="03">Privacy Settings</a></h4>

<p>Viddler allows users to upload and display User Content on the Viddler
Website and/or on other websites using the Viddler "Embeddable
Player." You have a choice of assigning one of three privacy settings to
each User Content you post. These include:</p>

<ol>
 <li><strong>Private</strong>.
     User Content that you publish as "Private" ("Private User
     Content") will be accessible to you and Viddler personnel in
     connection with the operation and administration of the Website.</li>
 <li><strong>Shared</strong>. User
     Content that you publish as "Shared" ("Shared User
     Content") will be accessible to the defined set of Viddler users of
     the Viddler Website. </li>

 <li><strong>Public</strong>. User
     Content that you publish as "Public" ("Public User
     Content") will be accessible to all Viddler users of the Viddler
     Website, whether or not they are registered Viddler users and to all
     partners, affiliates, agents, designees, licensors, licensees or sub-licensees
     (collectively, "Partners"). Furthermore, any Viddler user can
     publish your Public User Content on a website other than the Viddler
     Website, using the Embeddable Player. In addition, Public User Content may
     also be available for other Viddler users to modify, copy, download, or
     combine with other User Content.</li>
</ol>

<p>You understand and agree that while Viddler enables you to control who may
access your User Content, if you opt to publish your content or otherwise
distribute it to other third parties you are making your submissions available
to individuals in ways Viddler cannot and does not control. If you do choose to
share your information with third parties Viddler is not responsible for use of
your data by any such third party.</p>

<p>Consistent with its Terms and Conditions Viddler and its partners shall have
no liability whatsoever in connection with or arising out of your decision to
publish User Content as "Shared" or "Public" including
without limitation decisions you may make to change how this User Content is
published. You may later decide to change the access settings to the User
Content you publish, but you should be aware that there may still be copies of
the content available publicly which Viddler cannot and does not control.</p>

<h3><a name="04">Information Collection and How it is Used:</a></h3>

<h4><a name="05">General Information</a></h4>

<p>Viddler collects personal information when you create your user account with
Viddler to use Viddler Services (as defined in the <span class="s1">Terms and
Conditions) or to post content on the Viddler Website. When you register,
we ask for your full name, your email address, your age and certain optional
information such as your gender.</span></p>

<p>When you register and create your own account profile, Viddler will use your
personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and
functionality of the Viddler Service and Website including personalization and
customization based on what you share with Viddler or what Viddler learns about
you from your use of the Website.</p>

<p>Information you share publicly online may be shared or used in ways Viddler
cannot and does not control in any way. Such information might include
information you share online in message or discussion boards, emails, chat
areas, within your public profile, etc. Others could collect, use, and disclose
this information. Viddler cannot guarantee the security of such information
that you disclose or communicate online in public areas such as message boards,
chat rooms, and within your public profile and you do so at your own risk. </p>

<p>While Viddler currently does not charge fees to create an account at this
time, Viddler reserves the right at any time to charge fees for access to new
Viddler content or services or to portions (or all) of the existing Website or
Service. If you would like to obtain a paid account, we will ask for your billing
address, phone number, and credit card information. Consistent with this
policy, Viddler will take steps to secure this information and access the
information only for matters related to payment processing. Payment information
will not be shared with others unless or except in connection with processing
of payments and if so, subject to strict confidentiality obligations.</p>

<p>Viddler displays targeted advertisements based on personal information that
is exhibited in your profile. </p>

<h4><a name="06">Usage Tracking</a></h4>

<p>Viddler automatically receives and records information on our server logs
from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request.
Viddler uses information for the following general purposes: products and
services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services
improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting. Viddler may correlate
this information with the personal information of individual users.</p>

<h4><a name="07">IP Addresses</a></h4>

<p>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:</p>

<ol>
 <li>To diagnose or service
     technology problems reported by our users or engineers which are
     associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or
     ISP.</li>
 <li>To tailor advertising based
     on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address.
     Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to
     advertisers.</li>
 <li>To estimate the total number
     of users visiting the Viddler Website from specific geographical regions.</li>
 <li>To make sure that users are
     not voting for themselves or friends during contests or promotions.</li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="08">Cookies</a></h4>

<p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of
your computer, or use similar technologies to enhance or personalize the
Website and our relationship with you. The cookie itself does not contain personal
information although it will enable us to relate your use of this Website to
information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only
personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A
cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other
sites.</p>

<p>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or
notify you when a cookie is set.</p>

<p>If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Viddler products or
services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to
take full advantage of the Viddler Service or Website.</p>

<p>Viddler uses its own cookies and may use similar technologies for a number
of purposes, including to:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Access your information when
     you "sign in";</li>
 <li>Keep track of preferences you
     specify while you are using Viddler's Service;</li>
 <li>Display the most appropriate
     advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on the Viddler
     Website;</li>
 <li>Estimate and report our total
     audience size and traffic;</li>
 <li>Conduct research to improve
     Viddler's content and services; and </li>

 <li>Otherwise authenticate users
     and enhance, personalize, or customize your use of the Website.</li>
</ol>

<p>Viddler may use third-party authorized service providers under contracts
with Viddler to assist Viddler in displaying advertising to you, and in such
case may share the information in the cookie Viddler collects with such service
providers.</p>

<h4><a name="09">Information Sharing and Disclosure</a></h4>

<p>When you post User Content to the Viddler Website, your Viddler ID or alias
that you are posting under is visible to other users.</p>

<p>If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public,
you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. </p>

<p>Viddler may share personal information about you with other people or
nonaffiliated companies in the following circumstances:</p>

<ol>
 <li>If you submit personally
     identifiable information to us through the Website to create your own
     account profile, we may share your personally identifiable information
     with employees, contractors, agents doing work for Viddler or other third
     parties to provide you with the features and functionality of the Viddler
     Website and Service and to personalize and enhance our business
     relationship with you.</li>
 <li>Viddler may share
     non-personally identifiable aggregated demographic information with third
     parties (including Partners), such as "53% of users who regularly
     user Viddler chat are between the ages of 18 and 24" or the like.</li>
 <li>Viddler may also share your
     personal information and/or aggregate information with our, technical
     consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who work with us
     to create or maintain the Website, enhance its functionality or provide
     associated services.</li>
 <li>There may be portions of the
     Website, from time to time, that are co-branded or co-labeled with the
     brand or name belonging to one of Viddler's Partners. Although Viddler
     will own any non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable
     information collected about you from one of these co-branded areas, such
     information may be shared by Viddler with that Partner.</li>

 <li>Viddler may share personal
     information about Website users with third parties if doing so is
     appropriate to carry out a user's request, render its services or, if it
     reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or is in Viddler's
     interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or
     property of others.</li>
 <li>If Viddler should ever file
     for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity,
     information Viddler receives from you from this Website is a Viddler asset
     and may be transferred.</li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="10">Third Party Advertisers</a></h4>

<p>Viddler may work with and allow other companies (like Google), third-party
ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements within the Viddler Website.
These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send the
advertisements and links that appear on the Website directly to your web
browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may
also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to
measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and deliver the most relevant
ads to you. Viddler does not provide any personally identifiable information to
these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as
part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to
opt-in or opt-out and even then will take steps to ensure respect for the
confidentiality of this information. However, please note that if an advertiser
asks Viddler to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, women
ages 18-34) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server
may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to
reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party
ad servers or ad networks. Please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">
http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>
to learn about the information collection practices and "opt-out"

procedures of third party ad networks we may use. Other entities' use of their
cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. Viddler's Privacy Policy does
not apply to such other advertisers or web sites.</p>

<h4><a name="11">An Important Note on Children and Privacy</a></h4>

<p>Viddler does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable
information from persons under 13 years of age. If Viddler learns that such
information has been collected on our Website Viddler will take the appropriate
steps to delete this information. Any person who provides their personal
information to Viddler through this Website represents that they are 13 years
of age or older.</p>

<h4><a name="12">User Access</a></h4>

<p>You can change your Viddler account information at any time.</p>

<p>You can delete your Viddler account at any time from your settings page;
however, please note that your identification, billing and contact information
may remain in Viddler's records for some period.</p>

<p>We may send you certain communications relating to the Viddler Service, such
as service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part
of your Viddler account.</p>

<h4><a name="13">Security</a></h4>

<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your
transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. In
certain areas, we use commercially reasonable physical, managerial and
technical safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a
guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or
destroyed by a breach of security.</p>

<p>If Viddler learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you
electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Viddler may
post a notice on our Website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you
will need a web browser enabling you to view the Website. Viddler may also send
an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these
circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to
receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice
of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic
notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@viddler.com">privacy@viddler.com</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, Viddler cannot ensure that all
of your personally identifiable information and communications will remain
private and will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this
Policy. Therefore, although we maintain and make every effort to comply with
evolving privacy standards, we do not promise, nor should you expect, that your
personally identifiable information or private communications will always
remain private.</p>

<p>Your Viddler account information is password-protected. It is your
responsibility to keep your password private. Do not share your password with
anyone.</p>

<h4><a name="14">International Users</a></h4>

<p>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws
governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law please note
that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does
not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personal
data you consent to:</p>

<ol>
 <li>the use of your personal data
     for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and</li>
 <li>the transfer of your personal
     data to the United States as indicated above.</li>

</ol>

<h4><a name="15">Changes to this Privacy Policy</a></h4>

<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also
revise the "last updated" date on the Privacy Policy. For changes to
this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or
disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to
obtain your consent before implementing the change. We encourage you to
periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are
protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of this
Website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>
