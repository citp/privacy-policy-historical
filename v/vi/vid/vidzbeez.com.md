**Cookies Policy**

Last modified on 29 January 2014

When visiting the Site, we send “cookies” to your device. Cookies are small files of code, usually stored on a user's computer or device, which enable a website to "personalize" itself for each user and remember his preferences. Most websites that you visit today will use cookies in one way or another in order to improve your user experience. Similarly, we have placed cookies on your computer to improve your experience using VidsBeez. You can change your cookie settings at any time, but otherwise, we will assume you are OK to continue.

**What is a Cookie?**

Cookies are text strings of information that are downloaded to your computer or device when you are using VidsBeez. Your web browser then sends these cookies back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes those cookies. You can find more information about cookies at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 

Cookies are very helpful and can be used for various different purposes. These purposes include allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and making the interaction between you and the Site quicker and easier. Cookies are also used to help ensure that the advertisements you see are relevant to you and your interests.

**Different Types of Cookies**

There are four main types of cookie we use:

**Strictly necessary cookies:** These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around and use the features of a website, or to provide a service requested by you. We do not need to obtain your consent in order to use these cookies. ****

**Functionality cookies:** These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your account name, language or the region you are in) and provide more personal and enhanced features.  For instance, a website may be able to provide you with more localized information or products by using a cookie to store information about the region in which you are currently located, remember changes you have made to text or view size, and other parts of web pages that you can customize, and provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

**Performance cookies:** These cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for instance which pages you go to most often, and if you get error messages from them. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies you. All of the information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Site works.

**Targeting cookies or advertising cookies:** These cookies are used to deliver adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the permission of a website’s operator. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. For more information about online behavioral advertising cookies and online privacy, please see the guide produced by the internet advertising industry available at [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

**How to Manage Your Cookie Settings**

There are various ways in which you can manage and control your cookie settings.

**You should bear in mind that, by deleting or blocking cookies, some or all of the websites you visit (or features of them) may not work properly or as effectively.**

**Turning Off Cookies via Your Web Browser**

Most web browsers will provide you with some general information about cookies, enable you to see what cookies you’ve got, allow you to delete them all or on an individual basis, and enable you block or allow cookies for all websites or individually selected websites. You can also normally turn off third party advertising cookies separately. 

**Please note that if you adjust your cookie settings via your web browser then, unless you delete or block each cookie individually, the changes will apply to all websites that you visit – not just our Site. You will also need to adjust your cookies on a browser-by-browser basis.   **

**Turning Off Third Party Cookies**

You will have the option of turning off third party targeting/advertising cookies each time you see an advertisement that has been personalized to you.

Some advertising networks that partner with us may use cookies to better manage advertising campaigns, specifically to personalize advertising messages and to impose frequency caps. 

**Note that the third party listed above may need to set a cookie in order to remember that their targeting/advertising cookies should not be assigned to you in the future. If you change or delete your browser’s cookie file, or change or upgrade your browser or Device, then you might need to opt out again.**
