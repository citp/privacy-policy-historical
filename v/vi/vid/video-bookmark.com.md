We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20181005185059id_/http%3A//www.video-bookmark.com/terms.html), or as otherwise required by law.
