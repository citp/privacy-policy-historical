            Privacy Policy
        </h2>

        <p>
            Last updated: December 3, 2013
        </p>

        <p>
            Welcome to Vidme! We respect your privacy rights and we created 
            this policy to help you understand what information we collect and
            how we use it when you use our websites, mobile applications, and 
            other services (collectively, the “Services”).
        </p>

        <p class="question">
            What information do we collect?
        </p>

        <p>
            In operating our Services, we may ask you to provide personally 
            identifiable information such as your name, phone number, e-mail 
            address, contact information of your contacts, and other contact 
            information.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also get technical information when you use our products. Such 
            information is collected via:
        </p>

        <p>
            1.) Automatic Collection. Our servers automatically recognize 
            visitors' IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the 
            Internet), Internet service provider, browser type, computer 
            platform, referring web site, date and time of access, links 
            clicked through, and possibly other information as well. No 
            personal information about you is revealed in this process. The 
            Site may also gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not 
            personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing 
            purposes or for improving the services we offer.
        </p>

        <p>
            2.) Cookies. From time to time, we may use the standard "cookies"
            feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a
            small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Site.
            If you create an account on our Site, we may store your email
            address and a unique account tracking identification code in a
            cookie on your computer so that the Site remembers you. Cookies
            also help us learn which areas of our Site are useful and which
            areas need improvement. Our advertisers may also use cookies on
            our Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies once
            Site advertisers have been given permission to set cookies. This
            Policy only covers use of cookies by the Company itself, and does
            not cover use of cookies by any Site advertiser. You can choose
            whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
            However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience
            at our Site may be diminished and some features may not work as
            they were intended. We may also adopt newer technologies serving
            some of the same functions as cookies (including by way of
            example only, and not of limitation, HTML 5 local storage) from
            time to time.
        </p>

        <p>
            3.) Global Positioning System (GPS) Functionality. When you access
            our Site using a GPS-enabled (or equivalent "location-aware")
            device, we may collect this information from your device, and use
            it to provide certain location-based services, and you hereby
            consent to our collection and use of all such information. By way
            of example only, and not of limitation, we may use this information
            to display your distance from or your current location to other
            Members with whom you are "friends" or with whom you share a group
            (or equivalent). You may disable this functionality by altering
            your device settings so that location information is no longer
            made available, but if you do so this could negatively affect your
            experience while using or otherwise accessing the Site.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
            How do we use the information we collect?
        </p>

        <p>
            1.) Personal Information. We will not share your personal
            information with any third parties without your consent, except
            as necessary or appropriate to provide you with our services or to
            comply with the law. We may use your personal information to verify
            your identity. We may also use your contact information to inform
            you of any changes to our Services, to send you additional
            information about the Company and/or the Site, and to offer you
            other products, programs or services that we believe may be of
            interest to you from time to time.
        </p>

        <p>
            2.) Anonymous Information. We use anonymous information to analyze
            our Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for
            individually identifying information. In addition, we may use
            anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server,
            to administer our Site, or to display the content according to
            your preferences. Traffic and Site activity information may also
            be shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate
            and anonymous basis.
        </p>

        <p>
            3.) Use of Cookies. We may use cookies (and other technologies
            having similar functions, such as HTML 5 local storage) to deliver
            content specific to your interests, to remember you when you return
            to the Site, or for other purposes. Promotions or advertisements
            displayed on our Site may also contain cookies (or technologies
            with similar function). We do not have access to or control over
            information collected by outside advertisers on our Site.
        </p>

        <p>
            4.) Disclosure of Personal Information. We may disclose personal
            information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief
            that such action is necessary to (i) conform to the edicts of the
            law or comply with legal process served on the Company or its
            affiliates, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of
            the Company or of Site users, or (iii) act under exigent
            circumstances to protect the safety of Site users or the
            public at large.
        </p>

        <p>
            5.) Sale of Assets. In order to accommodate changes in our
            business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other
            companies or assets, including the information collected through
            the Site. If the Company or substantially all of its assets are
            acquired, customer information will be one of the assets

            Device and contact information
        </p>

        <p>
            Certain features of the Services require access to your device's
            native phonebook and image storage applications (e.g., to find
            friends or to store a message in your photo gallery). If you
            choose to find friends, the phone numbers in your device's native
            phonebook will be transmitted to our servers. Although you may
            decide whether or not to use these features, on Android devices
            you grant Vidme permission to access these features as part of
            the installation process. If you later decide to revoke this
            permission, you can do so by following the standard uninstall
            process and removing the Vidme mobile application from your
            device. Alternatively, on iOS devices, you can grant or revoke
            your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access
            your phonebook and image storage applications by changing the
            settings on your device.

        <p>
            Our Services are intended for adults, and we do not direct any of

            understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature
            of children's privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect
            that a Site user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly take
            any action we may deem appropriate, including without limitation
            conducting further inquiry/investigation and/or deleting that
            user's account.

            and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but

            such loss, misuse or alteration.

            deactivate these messages at any time by changing your settings
            within our mobile application (Android) or by changing the
            notification settings on your device (iOS).
