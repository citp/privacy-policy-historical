Third-party Advertisers & Links to Other Sites

Vidshadow.tv allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Vidshadow.tv Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Vidshadow.tv Sites.

They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or analytic methodology) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

Vidshadow.tv does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Vidshadow.tv Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
