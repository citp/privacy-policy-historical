How does Vidyard keep personal information safe?

The security of your personal information is important to us. Although we cannot guarantee 100% security, we use reasonably appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized use, access, modification, destruction or disclosure. We require our third party service providers to use similar safeguards to those we use.

We employ reasonably appropriate security measures to protect personal information against loss, unauthorized use, access, alteration, modification, disclosure or destruction. These measures include physical, organizational and technological measures. If we use third parties to help us provide our Services, we require such service providers to use similar safeguards to those we use. We also require service providers to limit access to your personal information and to keep it strictly confidential. Service providers are only permitted to use your personal information for the sole purpose of carrying out services on our behalf.

As businesses like Vidyard move towards greater use of technology, there is also an increasing drive to keep information secure and confident. Vidyard’s privacy and information technology compliance program has been independently audited and certified against globally recognized standards.

However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us.

Where is personal information stored?

Vidyard has its headquarters in Canada and the Vidyard Services are hosted in Canada and the United States. Some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located in Canada and the United States.

Canada has received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR.

The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union. Vidyard relies on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR. In particular, Vidyar collects and transfers to the U.S. personal data only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Vidyard in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.

Further, information may also be stored outside the country you reside, whose privacy and data protection laws may differ from your jurisdiction. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions.

Vidyard endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with Vidyard and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. Vidyard also minimizes the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive information about you.
