#### SCOPE OF POLICY

This policy applies to Kellwood's treatment of personally identifiable information that Kellwood collects through Kellwood's website and when you use Kellwood's services. The policy does not apply to practices of companies whose websites may be linked to Kellwood. For access to the privacy policies of such linked websites, please refer to the information provided by such websites at their home pages. Also see the paragraph below under the heading "Hypertext Links".

#### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

Kellwood collects personally identifiable information when you request information from Kellwood. On such occasions, Kellwood may ask for your name, email address, zip code and personal information concerning your interests, occupation, gender and other demographic information. Kellwood also receives and records information from server logs from your browser including cookie information relating to pages requested. 

Kellwood does not seek to collect such information from persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any such information to us. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 who has provided such information to us, please inform us (through the Kellwood website or telephone number listed above) and we will remove such information from our database as described further below. 

In addition, no person (of any age) is required to provide us with the personally identifiable information we request. If you do not wish to provide such information, you are free not to do so. Your provision of requested information to us through Kellwood’s website or other means is presumed by us to be voluntary and with your consent to the uses described herein. If after submitting personally identifiable information to us, you wish to "opt-out," please contact us as noted above and we will remove your information from our database as set forth below in the section titled "Managing Your Information." Please know that such a decision will not stop advertising or content that is generated prior to the time when we can accomplish the removal of your information. 

Kellwood uses the information you provide to us to customize advertising and content that we present to you, to contact you concerning specials, abandoned shopping carts and new products and to enhance our product offerings. Kellwood will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third party except when: 

  * You have been given an opportunity to "opt out" of sharing the information and have declined to exercise that right within the time period provided; 
  * Kellwood must share the information in order to provide a product or service that you have requested, in which case we will demand that any third party we use to fulfill your order agree that it does not have the right to use the personally identifiable information other than to fulfill your request; or 
  * Kellwood is required to respond to subpoena, court orders or other legal process requiring such disclosure. 



#### USE OF COOKIES

Kellwood uses cookies to enhance the interactive nature of your Internet experience and to provide a convenient feature to save you time. Cookies enable Kellwood to quickly retrieve specific information from previous visits and to recall features that you may have customized on your browser. 

#### MANAGING YOUR INFORMATION 

You are entitled to request access to and correction of all your personal data collected by us via Kellwood’s website, as well as to require us to delete your data if you no longer want us to process it. You can make such a request or a related inquiry by sending an email to customerservice@vince.com or by calling 800-960-2231. Please note that there may be a small charge for making an access request or it may be free, depending on the circumstances. You can find out more details by emailing or calling us as provided above. We will keep your data as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this privacy policy. You may choose not to receive unsolicited marketing material from Kellwood and you have the right to request deletion of your Kellwood account information, subject to Kellwood's need to keep appropriate archives of its business operations. 

#### SECURITY

Kellwood employs reasonable measures to maintain all personally identifiable information provided by you on computer servers in a controlled and secured environment in an effort to hinder unauthorized access, loss, alteration, use or disclosure of such information. Kellwood utilizes secure socket layer encryption technology and firewall network protection to protect personally identifiable information that is transmitted to Kellwood’s e-commerce websites. Unfortunately, the nature of the Internet is such that information may be transmitted over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed, deleted, altered, used or disclosed by unauthorized persons. 

Because of the international nature of the services and products provided by Kellwood’s website and the nature of Kellwood's business, personal data may, subject to applicable law, be transferred internationally throughout Kellwood world-wide for the purposes described above. This may mean that personal data are transferred to countries which do not have laws or regulations which protect personal data, such as the United States, where the server for Kellwood’s website is located. We use reasonable measures to limit the disclosure of the data you provide to us only to certain staff within Kellwood and its affiliates (i.e. staff whose job it is to process your inquiries and survey answers or otherwise to administer Kellwood’s website, and those staff involved in the provision of Kellwood services and products which may be of interest to you) and to require that they process the data only for the purposes identified in this privacy policy. 

To protect Kellwood’s customers from fraudulent transactions on Kellwood’s e-commerce websites, all orders are subject to review and verification. As part of the verification process, an order may be temporarily placed on hold in order to verify credit card billing information, which may include contacting the credit card holder.

#### MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY

Kellwood may make modifications or amendments to this policy from time to time. In the event that such changes alter how Kellwood gathers, processes, uses or discloses your personally identifiable information, Kellwood will post such changes on our website. 

#### INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
