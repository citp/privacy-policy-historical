Explorer, you are sharing that information with the Vintage Synth
Explorer alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. However,
some activities will, by their very nature, result in your personal

specifically stated otherwise.

permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in
good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described
below. The Vintage Synth Explorer may disclose account information in
special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be violating the Terms of Service of the the

some areas of the Synth Forums, but you will not be able to access areas
or use features that require you to submit personal information, such as
posting topics and ads. You also have choices with respect to cookies.

sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time

and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users,
regardless of age. In addition, the Vintage Synth Explorer will not send
any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of
13.

information online - for example in ads that you post or through email -
that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you
post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you
may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and
responsible whenever you're online.

aggregated information with third parties.

indirectly secure please be aware that the Internet is not a fully
secure medium.
