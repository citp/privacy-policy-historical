## Our Privacy Policy

#### Note from the founders:

> We’d just like to apologise for the formal and legal tone of our privacy policy, but it’s required with stricter new privacy laws, which is good for everyone, really. Just know that basically, we’re a members-only site, we look after our members, and that means we respect your privacy, we don’t share your information with other parties, and we don’t spam people. We try to do good. But here’s the formal stuff that you might like to know…

> Cheers, Andre Eikmeier + Justin Dry, co-founders
