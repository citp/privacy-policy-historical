# Vineyard Vines Privacy Policy

At Vineyardvines.com, your privacy is a top priority. Please read our privacy policy details. 

Vineyard Vines collects customer information to improve your overall shopping experience with us. We respect your privacy and are committed to maintaining and using this information responsibly. Except as otherwise mentioned below, this privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on our website. By visiting [vineyardvines.com](http://www.vineyardvines.com/) you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. 

Personal information relating to you and your order history are only available to you if you provide the correct password that you create. After providing your password, you can edit or delete your information at any time through the [My Account](https://www.vineyardvines.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/account.home/) page. 

If you forget your password, you can request that it be emailed to your email address. We will not give passwords out over the phone, nor will we email them to a different email address than the one used to register. If you request to have your password emailed to you, your credit card information will be deleted from your profile. 

Your address book, located in the [shipping addresses & contacts page](https://www.vineyardvines.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/account.home/), is your personal storage space. We do not use the names of the people in your address book to send email promotions or catalogs by mail. 

**Information We Share With Others**

Any personal information you provide to us on our website when you register or update an account, enter a promotion, shop online or request information (i.e. name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card information) is maintained in private files on our secure Web server and our internal systems. 

If you are visiting [vineyardvines.com](http://www.vineyardvines.com/) from a location outside of the United States, you will be connected through and to servers located within the United States. All vineyardvines.com orders will be accepted and fully processed in and shipped from the United States and all information you provide will be securely maintained in our Web server and internal systems located within the United States.

You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required to do so by law, governmental request or court order or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with such law, request or court order or to protect the users of our website or the public.

 **Links to Other Sites**

To enhance your shopping experience, the Vineyard Vines site may have links to other sites. Those Web sites will have their own policies on privacy that you may wish to review. Vineyard Vines has no responsibility for these linked Web sites. 

**Cookies**

We use cookies to recognize you and your preferences to make shopping easier and provide you with a customized experience on our website. Cookies are bits of information that we automatically store on your computer if your computer accepts cookies. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information such as your name, address or any financial information on your computer. Vineyard Vines places a unique user ID number on your cookie which allows us to access information that will improve your shopping experience - such as holding items in your shopping bag, accessing your address book, or providing you with customized pages based on your past viewing or purchasing preferences. We also use cookies to track traffic to different parts of the website in order to make improvements and optimize your shopping experience. 

If you do not wish to have a cookie on your system, you can set your browser preferences to refuse them. In order to disable cookies, please consult your browser's help section for instructions. 

**Changing Email Preferences  
**  
If you give us your email address either on the home page or when you register, order, we will send you emails about promotions. To remove yourself from our email list you may login to [My Account](https://www.vineyardvines.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/account.home/) and opt out of our email promotions.

When you supply your postal address either when requesting a free catalog or placing an order, you will receive the Vineyard Vines catalog by mail. If you choose to give us your telephone number on the order form, it is for the purpose of contacting you regarding your order. We will not call you regarding promotions. 

If you do not want a Vineyard Vines catalog, please send us an email to:                  [catalog@vineyardvines.com](mailto:catalog@vineyardvines.com) with the following: 

  * The phrase "no catalog" in the subject line 
  * Your name and your complete mailing address 



Although we strive to update our mailing list as frequently as possible, you might receive another catalog before we are able to remove you. 

**Updating Email or Postal Address**

You can edit or delete your email or postal address at anytime through the [My Account ](https://www.vineyardvines.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/account.home/)Page.

**Privacy of Young Children**

Vineyard Vines is concerned about the privacy of young children and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 13. Vineyard Vines does not sell products for purchase by children, and all children's products we sell are for purchase by adults only. 

**Security**

The security of your information is very important to us. We use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than Vineyard Vines. 

Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following: 

  * The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https" 
  * Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section for the browser window. 



Only browsers that use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer technology are able to order through the Vineyard Vines web site. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Netscape's home page. 

While we implement these and other security measures on this site, please note that 100% security is not always possible. 

**Policy Changes and Questions**

Vineyard Vines may update our privacy policy from time to time and use of the information we collect now is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time of use. Whenever we make a change, we will post the updated policy at this site and we encourage you to check our policy periodically. By using our website following the posting of a change in the privacy policy, you consent to the updated policy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please contact us:
