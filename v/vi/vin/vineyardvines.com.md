**Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

**Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.**

Mandatory, Bilateral Arbitration. BY OPTING INTO A MOBILE MESSAGING PROGRAM, YOU AND VINEYARD VINES AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, VINEYARD VINES MOBILE MESSAGES, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, BY FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.

This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted, and expressly includes claims brought under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227, or any other statute, regulation, or legal or equitable theory.

  * **Arbitration Rules**



Notwithstanding your and vineyard vines’ agreement that Missouri law governs interpretation and application of these terms generally, you further hereby agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., applies to this agreement to arbitrate, and governs all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration. 

Unless you and vineyard vines agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to [JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures](https://www.vineyardvines.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-Vineyard-Vines-Library/default/dw95f8c825/JAMS_streamlined_arbitration_rules-2014.pdf) (“JAMS Streamlined Rules”), as modified by this agreement, and consistent with [JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness](https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/) (“JAMS Consumer Fairness Standards”). Notwithstanding JAMS Streamlined Rule 8(b), you and vineyard vines agree that any dispute as to the arbitrability of a claim brought by either you or vineyard vines shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  * **The Arbitrator’s Decision**



The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by JAMS or by the arbitrator. 

The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms and Conditions, will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim, will be final and binding, and will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms and Conditions, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms and Conditions will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.
