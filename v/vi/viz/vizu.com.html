                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>			
                    
                    <p><b>We take user privacy extremely seriously.  </b></p>
                  <p>A detailed privacy policy is available below if you wish to review the complete legalese.  This is such an important topic however that we have put together below a set of summary questions and answers that we frequently hear and respond to ourselves.  We hope that after reading these questions you will clearly understand what we do and the value that we provide to the Internet ecosystem.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>What does Vizu do?</b></p>
                    <p>We provide research services to advertisers and marketers so that they understand how well (or not) their online advertising campaigns are working.  Our information is used for understanding advertising performance only, and is not used for any ad retargeting purposes or for reaching out to consumers.  </p>
                    <p>You may have reached this page by clicking on a privacy policy link from one of our survey units running across the Internet.  This unit is how we collect our data, by surveying actual users on the Internet as they are being exposed to online advertising.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>What information about me does Vizu collect?</b></p>
                    <p>As you surf Web sites on the Internet, you are exposed to advertising that is the primary source of revenue for those sites.  We provide a technology that is used with these ads to understand if they are working.  When you are exposed to one of these ads Vizu collects some anonymous information related to your exposure history (i.e. how many individual ads in each campaign you were exposed to, how many times you saw each one, which site you were on when you saw each advertisement, and your survey response if you answered).  This data is used to understand what impact the campaign is having on users.</p>
                    <p>The information that we collect is strictly limited to the ad campaign data described above.  We never collect any personably identifiable information about anyone, and no one would have the ability to contact you or tie any survey response back to you because of Vizu.</p>
                
                    <p><b>How will the information Vizu collects about me be used?</b></p>
                    <p>Vizu provides aggregated report data about various audiences that were exposed to advertising campaigns.  This information is provided to the advertisers and marketers responsible for those campaigns, and aids them in improving their advertising efforts in the future.  These advertisers spend money on the Web sites and applications that you view freely across the Internet, and Vizu is a critical part of enabling and improving this ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>Vizu does not provide user level data to aid in ad retargeting or other purposes related to contacting a specific person.  And it is important to remember that Vizu never collects any personably identifiable information about you at any time; all data collection is completely anonymous and cannot be tied back to you.</p>
    
    				<p><b>Why is this important?  Why should I be ok with Vizu tracking me?</b></p>
                    <p>The vast majority of the sites and applications on the Internet are free for users, and are able to survive as a business because of the revenue they generate from advertising campaigns that run on their properties.  Advertising essentially pays for much of the content and functionality on the Internet that you use every day.</p>
                    <p>Vizu plays an important role in this ecosystem by providing a safe and anonymous measurement system so that advertisers know exactly what is and is not working on their ad campaigns. This keeps advertising revenue flowing to the media properties you frequent, and keeps your viewing experience largely free of charge. We have strived to provide a meaningful service for advertisers with valuable data they can use, and that also respects your user privacy. If you encounter Vizu's technology you should be aware that our advertising customers will never know any information about you specifically that they could use to contact you in the future, and your responses will not be used to retarget advertising to you.</p>
    
                    <p><b>Can I opt-out of Vizu collecting any information about me?</b></p>
                  <p>Yes, by clicking on the button below.  This will download an "opt-out" cookie onto your computer which will prevent any future data collection by Vizu.  As long as this opt-out cookie remains on your computer Vizu will not collect any data about you.</p>

                        <p>Users are advised to read Vizu's entire Ad Catalyst Privacy Policy immediately below.</p>

                          From time to time, Vizu may need to change our Privacy Policy because of changes in the law, in technology, in Vizu's business, or in our attempts to serve your needs better.

By responding to an Ad Catalyst survey and providing such information, you consent to Vizu's Ad Catalyst Privacy Policy, including the collection and uses of the information described in this policy.</p>
                        <p>Information Gathered through Cookies: <br>
                          Ad Catalyst measures the performance of online advertising campaigns on the Internet. When Ad Catalyst is employed on a given ad campaign, it utilizes a small file on users' computers called a "cookie" to track the impression history of the campaign being measured. Vizu does not collect any personably identifiable information in these cookies; all data is completely safe and anonymous. The data that is collected in these cookies is limited to a list of the advertising creative units in the campaigns seen by each user, along with the number of times each unit was seen and the day/time of each exposure. This data is used during analysis of the campaign to understand which ad units were most effective. This is the sole purpose of this data and it is not used for any other intention. Users are free to change their web browsers to prevent the acceptance of cookies if so desired.</p>
                        <p>Survey Responses: <br>
                          Ad Catalyst only presents a single survey question to a small subset of the viewers of an advertising campaign. This question is a multiple choice question with a predetermined set of answer choices related to the primary marketing objective of the ad campaign. The survey questions never ask any personably identifiable information. If you choose to respond to an Ad Catalyst survey question, you response will be captured and stored in our database. Again, all survey responses are completely anonymous and do not contain any personably identifiable information.</p>
                        <p>Site Registration: <br>
                          For customers of the Ad Catalyst service who are using the technology to measure their advertising efforts, registration is required to enable access to some features, functionality, and information on the Site, to send you specific information related to your service, to allow you to access stored information, and to facilitate communication from Vizu to you. When registering on Vizu you may need to provide your full name and email address. You will also need to select a username and password for your account.</p>
                        <p>COPPA COMPLIANCE &amp; CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 <br>
                          Ad Catalyst is used to monitor advertising campaigns on a wide variety of websites including those that may focus on younger audiences. In these situations it is important to protect the privacy and safety of these viewers. The Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) applies to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13, and is designed to protect their privacy and safety online. The following is language from the act and appears directly on the COPPA website:</p>
                        <p>"The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule applies to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child."</p>
                        <p>In situations where personal information is being gathered from children under the age of 13, parental consent is required. Fortunately, Ad Catalyst is a completely anonymous measurement system that does not collect any personably identifiable information from anyone. The data that Ad Catalyst collects is restricted to the exposure history of a campaign, and users' responses to a single survey question related to the primary objective of the ad campaign. Vizu never collects email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, demographic profile information, or any other data that could be tied back to a respondent, regardless of their age. There is no way to use the data gathered by Ad Catalyst to contact any respondent. The data is used for learning how a campaign performed only, and is presented in summarized format to our customers. Our single question survey approach helps to ensure that the focus of the measurement remains on the ad campaign's effectiveness, and the service is fully compliant with all of the rules set forth by COPPA regarding data collection of children under the age of 13.</p>
                        <p>HOW DOES VIZU USE COLLECTED INFORMATION? <br>
                          Ad Catalyst data is used to report the performance of advertising campaigns, allowing our customers to improve their marketing efforts. The data gathered by Ad Catalyst is reported back to our customers in aggregated, anonymous format. Viewers of ad campaigns who respond to an Ad Catalyst survey question should be assured that their response is safe and anonymous, and no personably identifiable information is ever gathered about them in the course of interacting with the service.</p>
                        <p>For paying customers of the Ad Catalyst service, Vizu uses personally identifiable user information for the purposes of our Site and the services offered on our Site. By registering on our Site, you provide permission for Vizu to contact you via email regarding your activities on the Site, as well as to notify you of new services that we may be offering. All users have the ability to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Vizu. In all cases, we strive to work only with other entities that understand the sensitivity of personal information and have and uphold strict privacy policies.</p>
                        <p>SECURITY <br>
                          The importance of security for all information associated with our users is important to us. We strongly recommend that you employ a secure browser - one that supports secure transmission of data across the Internet. For more information, use your browser's help feature. We implement commercially reasonable measures in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note, if you do not logout once registered for services that require registration, your information could be viewed by other users with access to your computer. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Your Vizu password is protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Vizu will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.</p>
                        <p>CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP <br>
                          In the event of a change in ownership, merger or acquisition with another entity, sale or pledge of company assets, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, we reserve the right to transfer all of Vizu's user information, including email addresses, postal addresses, and other personally identifiable information, to third parties as one of our business assets.</p>
                        <p>PROTECTION OF VIZU AND OTHERS <br>
                          Vizu may disclose collected information pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, where required by law, or, at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the public or to prevent the violation of our Terms of Service Agreement or of the rights of Vizu or any third party.</p>

                        <p>VIZU WEB POLLS PRIVACY POLICY<br>
                          We at Vizu, Inc. ("Vizu", "we", or "us") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy rights of our users. We have created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how personally identifiable information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our suite of web properties located at the primary domain of Vizu.com (the "Site").

                        <p>POLICY DATE: <br>
                          This policy was last updated on September 18, 2007.</p>

                          From time to time, Vizu may need to change our Privacy Policy because of changes in the law, in technology, in Vizu's business, or in our attempts to serve your needs better.

                          Our Site is intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons under 13 years of age are prohibited from registering on our Site. All persons between the ages of 13 and 18 must have a parent assist in the completion of registration on our Site.</p>
                        <p>WHAT INFORMATION DOES VIZU GATHER? <br>
                          The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to us is completely at your discretion. Some areas of our Site are accessible without registration of any kind. This is true of many of the basic content areas on our Site. Other areas of our Site require registration in order for you to participate in the services offered. It is not mandatory for you to register and provide information to us, but please realize that in order for us to serve you better, you will need to provide certain information to access some areas of our Site, to obtain or register for the specialized services we provide, or to complete transactions that you initiate on our Site. If you choose not to provide information, we may not be able to permit access to such areas, provide those specialized services, or complete such transactions. A user's email address and other personally identifiable information collected are used only as described in this Privacy Policy and, unless opted-out, for the purposes of offering you goods and services that, in the sole discretion of Vizu and its affiliates, you may find interesting or of use. By providing such information, you consent to Vizu's Privacy Policy, including the collection and uses of the information described in this policy.</p>
                        <p>Registration: <br>
                          Registration is required to enable access to some features, functionality, and information on the Site, to send you specific information related to your service, to allow you to access stored information, and to facilitate communication from Vizu to you. When registering on Vizu you may need to provide your full name and email address, along with other personally identifiable information that may be voluntarily provided. You will also need to select a username and password for your account. Also, we may collect information that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions. From time-to-time we may post contests or sweepstakes on our Site, which may request demographic information and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to participate and disclose information.</p>
                        <p>Communication Features: <br>
                          Our users also have the option of forwarding some of our content to friends, colleagues or acquaintances (Contacts) through such features as our email and IM capabilities. If a user elects to use our communication features, we ask them for the required contact information (e.g. email address or IM address). Vizu stores this information for the sole purpose of sending these messages only; we will not use this information for other purposes unless the Contacts register on our Site. Contacts may contact Vizu to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
                        <p>Information Gathered through Traffic Monitoring: <br>
                          Like many other Web sites, our Site is equipped with a program that monitors traffic by automatically logging information such as visitor's host, domain name, pages visited, length of user sessions, browser type and/or IP address. This program tracks the number of times the Site is hit, how many visitors come to the Site, which parts of the Site they frequent, and the length of time of each visit. Please note that if you have registered with us, this information may contain personally identifiable information, and is used to evaluate areas of interest and to improve the Vizu Site. In addition to log information, we may use a variety of technologies to create a more personalized experience for our users. A cookie is a small text file placed on a user's computer when a user visits a Web site. The cookie gives the user a unique, random ID, and this ID enables our Site to readily recognize each visitor on a subsequent visit to the Site. For example, a cookie may indicate the preferences selected by a visitor on a prior visit, and facilitate more efficient browsing on subsequent visits by using such preferences to customize the content and/or layout of our Site for the visitor. Vizu may use cookies. Users are free to change their web browsers to prevent the acceptance of cookies. However, subscribers of Vizu must enable cookies to access member areas. Vizu's cookies may contain personally identifiable information collected by Vizu. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages. We may use pixel tags to gather information about the e-mails we send to our registered users and to recipients of referral messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may read cookies. Our web pages may also contain similar pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage, and to deliver co-branded services as they become available. Our pixel tags collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. Our web pages may also contain pixel tags placed there by third party ad servers, to monitor the effectiveness of their advertising.</p>
                        <p>HOW DOES VIZU USE COLLECTED INFORMATION? <br>
                          Vizu uses personally identifiable user information for the purposes of our Site and the services offered on our Site.

All users have the ability to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Vizu. In all cases, we strive to work only with other entities that understand the sensitivity of personal information and have and uphold strict privacy policies.</p>

We are not responsible for, or have any control over, the privacy policies of those third party websites and ad servers, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when linking directly from our Site.</p>
                        <p>HOW CAN USERS UPDATE THEIR INFORMATION OR OPT-OUT? <br>

You indicate your option whether or not to receive this information by checking or unchecking the appropriate box as provided on the form.</p>
