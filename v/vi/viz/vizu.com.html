<p><b>USE BY CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE PROHIBITED</b><br>
    Our Site is intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons under 13 years of age are prohibited from registering on our Site. All persons between the ages of 13 and 18 must have a parent assist in the completion of registration on our Site.

<p>
    <a name="information"><b>WHAT INFORMATION DOES VIZU GATHER?</b></a><br>
    The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to us is
    completely at your discretion. Some areas of our Site are accessible without
    registration of any kind. This is true of many of the basic content areas on our
    Site. Other areas of our Site require registration in order for you to
    participate in the services offered. It is not mandatory for you to register and
    provide information to us, but please realize that in order for us to serve you
    better, you will need to provide certain information to access some areas of our
    Site, to obtain or register for the specialized services we provide, or to
    complete transactions that you initiate on our Site. If you choose not to
    provide information, we may not be able to permit access to such areas, provide
    those specialized services, or complete such transactions. A user's email
    address and other personally identifiable information collected are used only as
    described in this Privacy Policy and, unless opted-out, for the purposes of
    offering you goods and services that, in the sole discretion of Vizu and its
    affiliates, you may find interesting or of use. By providing such information,
    you consent to Vizu's Privacy Policy, including the collection and uses of the
    information described in this policy.
</p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Information gathered through registration, login, and participation in Vizu polls or
        other services:<br>
        Registration is required to enable access to some features, functionality,
        and information on the Site, to send you specific information related to
        your service, to allow you to access stored information, and in the event
        that you do not opt-out, to provide third party access to you. When
        registering on Vizu you may need to provide your full name and email address,
        along with other personally identifiable information that may be voluntarily
        provided. You will also need to select a username and password for your
        account.&nbsp; Also, we may collect
        information that identifies you personally when you send us comments,
        questions or suggestions. From time-to-time we may post contests or
        sweepstakes on our Site, which may request demographic information and
        customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary
        and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to
        participate and disclose information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Communication Features:<br>
        Our users also have the option of forwarding some of our content to friends,
        colleagues or acquaintances (Contacts) through such features as our email
        and IM capabilities.&nbsp; If a user
        elects to use our communication features, we ask them for the required
        contact information (e.g. email address or IM address).&nbsp;
        Vizu stores this information for the sole purpose of sending these
        messages only; we will not use this information for other purposes unless
        the Contacts registers on our Site. Contacts may <a href="contact-us.html?referrer=%2fpolicy.html" class="purple"><b>contact Vizu</b></a> to request the removal of this information from our database.
    </li>
    <li>
        Information gathered through traffic monitoring<br>
        Like many other Web sites, our Site is equipped with a program that monitors
        traffic by automatically logging information such as visitor's host, domain
        name, pages visited, length of user sessions, browser type and/or IP address.
        This program tracks the number of times the Site is hit, how many visitors
        come to the Site, which parts of the Site they frequent, and the length of
        time of each visit. Please note that if you have registered with us, this
        information may contain personally identifiable information, and is used to
        evaluate areas of interest and to improve the Vizu site and may be provided
        to third parties by Vizu or its affiliates. In addition to log information,
        we may use a variety of technologies to create a more personalized
        experience for our users. A cookie is a small text file placed on a user's
        computer when a user visits a Web site. The cookie gives the user a unique,
        random ID, and this ID enables our Site to readily recognize each visitor on
        a subsequent visit to the Site. For example, a cookie may indicate the
        preferences selected by a visitor on a prior visit, and facilitate more
        efficient browsing on subsequent visits by using such preferences to
        customize the content and/or layout of our Site for the visitor. Vizu may
        use cookies. Users are free to change their web browsers to prevent the
        acceptance of cookies. However, subscribers of Vizu must enable cookies to
        access member areas. Vizu's cookies may contain personally identifiable
        information collected by Vizu. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are
        included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages. We may use pixel tags to gather
        information about the e-mails we send to our registered users and to
        recipients of referral messages. When such a message is opened in an
        HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server to
        retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows us to record and store the date and
        time, the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information.
        The pixel tag also may read cookies. Our web pages may also contain similar
        pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to
        compile aggregated statistics about Site usage, and to deliver co-branded
        services as they become available. Our pixel tags collect only a limited set
        of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and
        a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. Our web pages may
        also contain pixel tags placed there by third party ad servers, to monitor
        the effectiveness of their advertising. <div align="right"><a href="policy.html#policy_top"><img src="img/top-link.gif" width="39" height="12" alt="Back to Top" title="Back to Top"></a></div>

<p><a name="how_use"><b>HOW DOES VIZU USE COLLECTED INFORMATION?</b></a></p>
<p>
    Vizu uses personally identifiable user information for the purposes of our Site and
    the services offered on our Site. By registering on our Site, you provide
    permission for Vizu to contact you via email, or other automated means of
    communication, and to share your information with third parties to offer goods
    and services to you, to facilitate the process of applying to college. All users
    have the ability to opt-out of receiving advertising emails or other advertising
    communications from Vizu. Users may also opt-out of sharing this information
    with our partners and third parties. If you have not opted out from being
    contacted by a third party, then your personal information could be used by our
    partners and third parties to direct targeted messages to you. In addition, once
    we have provided information to our suppliers or selected vendors or third
    parties due to registration, requests for services, or transactions initiated by
    you, we are not responsible for their use of the information, and you should
    consult their respective privacy and information use policies.&nbsp;
    In all cases, we strive to work only with other entities that understand
    the sensitivity of personal information and have and uphold strict privacy
    policies.

    Vizu provides, for the convenience of our users, the opportunity to link to Web
    sites of organizations not related to Vizu, Inc. If you click on a hypertext
    link that takes you to a Web site outside of Vizu, we are not responsible for
    their privacy policies or information collection practices and uses. In addition,
    when you initiate a transaction with one of our suppliers or selected vendors

    vendor for the transaction becomes subject to the supplier or selected vendor's
    privacy or information use policies. Vizu is not responsible for the privacy or

    The importance of security for all personal information associated with our
    users is important to us. We strongly recommend that you employ a secure browser
    - one that supports secure transmission of data across the Internet. For more
    information, use your browser's help feature. We implement commercially
    reasonable measures in providing secure transmission of your information from
    your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
    Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note, if you do not logout
    once registered for services that require registration, your personal
    information could be viewed by other users with access to your computer. Once we
    receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our
    systems. Your Vizu password is protected so that only you can access it and view
    the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not
    divulge your password to anyone. Vizu will never ask you for your password in an
    unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining
    the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Please note, if you
    choose to participate in our online discussion forums, your posts will be
    publicly accessible, as will your username.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Unless you choose to reveal more about yourself to other users of Vizu,
    you will be known only by your User Name / User ID, which need not reflect your
    true identity in any way.
