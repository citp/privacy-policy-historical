# Vizu: Privacy Policy

## VIZU PRIVACY PRINCIPLES - THE BOTTOM LINE

Our business is predicated on trust and privacy.

We respect our users' privacy, and we will strive to earn our users' trust and to maintain their privacy every day.

All data collected from the general public, as voters of Vizu surveys and polls located on the Internet, is collected anonymously and never tied to any personably identifiable information (PII). Vizu does not ever collect any personably identifiable information through these surveys and polls.

For customers of our products (Ad Catalyst, Power Polls & Web Polls) some personal information is required to register and establish a secure account for these services. This information is kept private and will never be shared externally. We will never rent or sell your email address or any other contact information with anyone. We use this information for the sole purpose of communicating with you about your business with Vizu, or to notify you about new services that we may be offering.

## VIZU AD CATALYST PRIVACY SUMMARY

The Ad Catalyst ad measurement service gathers data from the general public in anonymous fashion. No personably identifiable information is ever collected by Ad Catalyst regarding the viewers of an ad campaign.

Paying customers of Vizu's Ad Catalyst system who are monitoring the performance of their advertising campaigns must provide registration information to access this service through a secure website. This information is kept private and will never be shared externally.

The anonymous data collected by Ad Catalyst is reported to our customers in a summarized format, and is used purely to learn how advertising campaigns performed and can be improved for the future. This data is never used to recontact individuals for any purpose, nor is it used for any kind of ad targeting purposes.

While Ad Catalyst is intended to improve advertising efforts on public websites (and this advertising is the source of revenue that make these sites available for free use by the public), viewers of ad campaigns are free to opt-out of measurement by the Ad Catalyst service at any time. An opt-out button to accomplish this is provided further below on this page.

Users are advised to read Vizu's entire Ad Catalyst Privacy Policy immediately below.

## VIZU AD CATALYST PRIVACY POLICY

We at Vizu Corporation ("Vizu", "we", or "us") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy rights of our users. We have created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our Ad Catalyst service located at the primary domain of Vizu.com (the "Site"). BY ACCESSING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR RESPONDING TO ANY AD CATALYST SURVEY, YOU CONSENT TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.

**POLICY DATE:**   
This policy was last updated on September 1, 2008. 

**CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**   
From time to time, Vizu may need to change our Privacy Policy because of changes in the law, in technology, in Vizu's business, or in our attempts to serve your needs better. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post a new statement on our Site and update the effective date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our Privacy Policy whenever you visit this Site to see if it has been updated since your last visit. Below we explain how we may collect personal information, what we do with it, and how we protect it. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DOES VIZU GATHER?**   
Ad Catalyst is a measurement service that monitors the performance of brand advertising campaigns on the Internet. All data recorded by this service is anonymous, and no personably identifiable information is ever collected. All data is for the sole purpose of understanding the effectiveness of ad campaigns, and improving the performance of these campaigns. By responding to an Ad Catalyst survey and providing such information, you consent to Vizu's Ad Catalyst Privacy Policy, including the collection and uses of the information described in this policy. 

**Information Gathered through Cookies:**   
Ad Catalyst measures the performance of online advertising campaigns on the Internet. When Ad Catalyst is employed on a given ad campaign, it utilizes a small file on users' computers called a "cookie" to track the impression history of the campaign being measured. Vizu does not collect any personably identifiable information in these cookies; all data is completely safe and anonymous. The data that is collected in these cookies is limited to a list of the advertising creative units in the campaigns seen by each user, along with the number of times each unit was seen and the day/time of each exposure. This data is used during analysis of the campaign to understand which ad units were most effective. This is the sole purpose of this data and it is not used for any other intention. Users are free to change their web browsers to prevent the acceptance of cookies if so desired. 

**Survey Responses:**   
Ad Catalyst only presents a single survey question to a small subset of the viewers of an advertising campaign. This question is a multiple choice question with a predetermined set of answer choices related to the primary marketing objective of the ad campaign. The survey questions never ask any personably identifiable information. If you choose to respond to an Ad Catalyst survey question, you response will be captured and stored in our database. Again, all survey responses are completely anonymous and do not contain any personably identifiable information. 

**Site Registration:**   
For customers of the Ad Catalyst service who are using the technology to measure their advertising efforts, registration is required to enable access to some features, functionality, and information on the Site, to send you specific information related to your service, to allow you to access stored information, and to facilitate communication from Vizu to you. When registering on Vizu you may need to provide your full name and email address. You will also need to select a username and password for your account. 

**COPPA COMPLIANCE & CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13**   
Ad Catalyst is used to monitor advertising campaigns on a wide variety of websites including those that may focus on younger audiences. In these situations it is important to protect the privacy and safety of these viewers. The Children�s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) applies to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13, and is designed to protect their privacy and safety online. The following is language from the act and appears directly on the [COPPA website](http://www.coppa.org/): 

"The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule applies to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child."

In situations where personal information is being gathered from children under the age of 13, parental consent is required. Fortunately, Ad Catalyst is a completely anonymous measurement system that does not collect any personably identifiable information from anyone. The data that Ad Catalyst collects is restricted to the exposure history of a campaign, and users' responses to a single survey question related to the primary objective of the ad campaign. Vizu never collects email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, demographic profile information, or any other data that could be tied back to a respondent, regardless of their age. There is no way to use the data gathered by Ad Catalyst to contact any respondent. The data is used for learning how a campaign performed only, and is presented in summarized format to our customers. Our single question survey approach helps to ensure that the focus of the measurement remains on the ad campaign's effectiveness, and the service is fully compliant with all of the rules set forth by COPPA regarding data collection of children under the age of 13.

**HOW DOES VIZU USE COLLECTED INFORMATION?**   
Ad Catalyst data is used to report the performance of advertising campaigns, allowing our customers to improve their marketing efforts. The data gathered by Ad Catalyst is reported back to our customers in aggregated, anonymous format. Viewers of ad campaigns who respond to an Ad Catalyst survey question should be assured that their response is safe and anonymous, and no personably identifiable information is ever gathered about them in the course of interacting with the service. 

For paying customers of the Ad Catalyst service, Vizu uses personally identifiable user information for the purposes of our Site and the services offered on our Site. By registering on our Site, you provide permission for Vizu to contact you via email regarding your activities on the Site, as well as to notify you of new services that we may be offering. All users have the ability to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Vizu. In all cases, we strive to work only with other entities that understand the sensitivity of personal information and have and uphold strict privacy policies.

**SECURITY**   
The importance of security for all information associated with our users is important to us. We strongly recommend that you employ a secure browser - one that supports secure transmission of data across the Internet. For more information, use your browser's help feature. We implement commercially reasonable measures in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note, if you do not logout once registered for services that require registration, your information could be viewed by other users with access to your computer. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Your Vizu password is protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Vizu will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. 

**CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP**   
In the event of a change in ownership, merger or acquisition with another entity, sale or pledge of company assets, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, we reserve the right to transfer all of Vizu's user information, including email addresses, postal addresses, and other personally identifiable information, to third parties as one of our business assets. 

**PROTECTION OF VIZU AND OTHERS**   
Vizu may disclose collected information pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, where required by law, or, at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the public or to prevent the violation of our Terms of Service Agreement or of the rights of Vizu or any third party. 

**OPTING OUT OF VIZU'S AD CATALYST AD MEASUREMENT SERVICE**   
Ad Catalyst is a measurement service that allows advertisers, agencies, and publishers to understand how effective their ad campaigns are. Ad Catalyst tracks the ad impression history of certain ads that you see online and stores this information in a cookie on your computer. When you vote in an Ad Catalyst survey, Vizu gathers the impression history in your cookie along with your vote. **No personally identifiable information is ever collected by Ad Catalyst. Ad Catalyst is a completely safe and anonymous service.** The collected information is limited to identification values of the ads, the number of times you were exposed to each ad, and the time of each ad exposure. 

Ad Catalyst plays a valuable function as it helps to improve the quality of online advertising, the primary source of revenue for most sites on the Web. When you participate in an Ad Catalyst survey, you are helping to keep those sites online by providing valuable feedback on the advertising campaigns they carry. However, if you wish to opt-out of Vizu's Ad Catalyst service, you can do so by clicking the button below. This action downloads a do-not-track cookie to your machine (also referred to as an "opt-out" cookie) and you will no longer be tracked or surveyed about ad campaigns that you may view. You must keep this do-no-track cookie on your computer and not remove it in order to remain opt-ed out of the Ad Catalyst service. 

**WHO CAN I CONTACT FOR MORE INFORMATION?**   
If you have questions you may [contact us](http://answers.vizu.com/contact-us.htm) or write us at Vizu, Inc., 463 Pacific Ave, San Francisco, CA. 94133. Vizu will use all reasonable efforts to assist you. 

## VIZU WEB POLLS AND POWER POLLS PRIVACY SUMMARY

Much of Vizu's sites and services are available for anonymous use by the general public. Users can vote on Vizu polls either through the off-site poll widgets, or on the Vizu Web Polls site itself, without providing any personal information. Vizu deeply respects the privacy of this data and does not make it available on the site, other than in aggregate form, unless requested or allowed by the user. 

The Vizu Web Polls experience is enhanced for registered users proportionately to the information they choose to share about themselves during registration and in their user preferences.

Vizu does use the information collected via interaction with its service to continually improve its service and offerings and those of its partners.

Vizu respects the fact the various people may have different wishes with respect to the degree that they are contacted by Vizu or any of its partners. Vizu and its partners will only contact users to the degree they specify.

Users are free to update or delete their information and preferences or to opt out of the Vizu sites and services at any time.

Users are advised to read Vizu's entire Web Polls and Power Polls Privacy Policy below.

**WHAT INFORMATION DOES VIZU GATHER?**   
The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to us is completely at your discretion. Some areas of our Site are accessible without registration of any kind. This is true of many of the basic content areas on our Site. Other areas of our Site require registration in order for you to participate in the services offered. It is not mandatory for you to register and provide information to us, but please realize that in order for us to serve you better, you will need to provide certain information to access some areas of our Site, to obtain or register for the specialized services we provide, or to complete transactions that you initiate on our Site. If you choose not to provide information, we may not be able to permit access to such areas, provide those specialized services, or complete such transactions. A user's email address and other personally identifiable information collected are used only as described in this Privacy Policy and, unless opted-out, for the purposes of offering you goods and services that, in the sole discretion of Vizu and its affiliates, you may find interesting or of use. By providing such information, you consent to Vizu's Privacy Policy, including the collection and uses of the information described in this policy. 

**Registration:**   
Registration is required to enable access to some features, functionality, and information on the Site, to send you specific information related to your service, to allow you to access stored information, and to facilitate communication from Vizu to you. When registering on Vizu you may need to provide your full name and email address, along with other personally identifiable information that may be voluntarily provided. You will also need to select a username and password for your account. Also, we may collect information that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions.

**Communication Features:**   
Our users also have the option of forwarding some of our content to friends, colleagues or acquaintances (Contacts) through such features as our email and IM capabilities. If a user elects to use our communication features, we ask them for the required contact information (e.g. email address or IM address). Vizu stores this information for the sole purpose of sending these messages only; we will not use this information for other purposes unless the Contacts register on our Site. Contacts may contact Vizu to request the removal of this information from our database. 

**Information Gathered through Traffic Monitoring:**   
Like many other Web sites, our Site is equipped with a program that monitors traffic by automatically logging information such as visitor's host, domain name, pages visited, length of user sessions, browser type and/or IP address. This program tracks the number of times the Site is hit, how many visitors come to the Site, which parts of the Site they frequent, and the length of time of each visit. Please note that if you have registered with us, this information may contain personally identifiable information, and is used to evaluate areas of interest and to improve the Vizu Site. In addition to log information, we may use a variety of technologies to create a more personalized experience for our users. A cookie is a small text file placed on a user's computer when a user visits a Web site. The cookie gives the user a unique, random ID, and this ID enables our Site to readily recognize each visitor on a subsequent visit to the Site. For example, a cookie may indicate the preferences selected by a visitor on a prior visit, and facilitate more efficient browsing on subsequent visits by using such preferences to customize the content and/or layout of our Site for the visitor. Vizu may use cookies. Users are free to change their web browsers to prevent the acceptance of cookies. However, subscribers of Vizu must enable cookies to access member areas. Vizu's cookies may contain personally identifiable information collected by Vizu. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages. We may use pixel tags to gather information about the e-mails we send to our registered users and to recipients of referral messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may read cookies. Our web pages may also contain similar pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage, and to deliver co-branded services as they become available. Our pixel tags collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. Our web pages may also contain pixel tags placed there by third party ad servers, to monitor the effectiveness of their advertising.
