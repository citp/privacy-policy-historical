## The privacy of children

Vizualize.me services are intended for general audiences. Vizualize.me does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without the consent of their parents or guardians. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. 

## The quality of personal data

We take reasonable steps to keep the personal data we possess accurate and to delete incorrect or unnecessary personal data. 

We encourage you to access your personal data through your account from time to time to ensure that it is up to date. 

## Information on Cookies usage

Cookies are pieces of text that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access our Website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your cookies through your browser settings. 

We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use our services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don’t combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and that your web browser has accessed aspects of the services, and we may associate that information with your account if you have one. This information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on the services. 

Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. Please note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. 

## What are your rights?

  * You have a right to know what personal data we have about you.

  * You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time



Please refer to our  [Help](https://vizme.helpscoutdocs.com/) center to read about how to update or delete your personal data. 

## How we store your data

Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot guarantee the security of personally identifiable information. Please remember that: 

  * You provide personal data at your own risk. Unfortunately, there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted.
  * You are responsible of your username and password: keep them secret and safe!
  * If you believe your privacy has been breached, please contact us immediately on [vizualize.me@gmail.com](mailto:vizualize.me@gmail.com)
