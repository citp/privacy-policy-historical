### 6\. Third Party Transfer and Access

In case of Facebook DPA based retargeting- Vizury shares information about the User’s activity on that device, including web pages and mobile apps that are visited or used. Vizury also shares the Device ID and cookie with some of its Partners to provide the Services.

The Data will also pass through our infrastructure provider systems – AWS and in case of Retargeting Services, Performance Data will be accessed by Partners to enable the provision of Retargeting Services

Apart from the above Service related transfer and access; Vizury will not share Data with organizations or individuals external to Vizury unless it is essential to meet:

a. Applicable laws, regulations, legal processes or enforceable governmental request.

c. Detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues.

d. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Vizury, users or the public as required or permitted by law.

### 7\. Legal Basis

With respect to Retargeting Services, Vizury acts as an intermediary between Advertisers and Partners and with respect to Push Notification Services, Vizury acts as a vendor. Hence, in both cases, Vizury is not facing the User. Therefore, Vizury considers unambiguous consent as the most applicable basis for its’ Advertisers and Partners who collect Data, including technical identifiers. 

Under GDPR, with respect to Performance Data, Vizury acts as a co-data controller with Advertisers and Publishers. 

Under GDPR, with respect to Push Notification Data, Vizury acts as a processor and the Advertiser acts as the controller.
