  the Viewpoints Site pages or the pages of certain Viewpoints partners, when
  you enter promotions and sweepstakes via the Viewpoints Site and when you
  participate in market research studies sponsored by Viewpoints. Viewpoints
  may combine information about you we have with information we obtain from
  business partners or other companies.</p>

  <p>When you register with Viewpoints, we ask for information such as your
  name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code and/or password among
  other contact requirements. The registration form information requests may
  change from time to time. When you register with Viewpoints and sign in to
  our service, you are not anonymous to us.</p>

  <p>Any additional information, including personal information, you include
  in a user profile or post to the Viewpoints Site will be publicly available
  and may be accessed by visitors to the site. Any information you choose to
  include in a user profile or post to the Viewpoints Site is provided at your
  sole discretion.</p>

  <p>Viewpoints automatically receives and records information on our server
  logs from your browser, including your IP Address, Viewpoints cookie
  information, and each page you request.</p>

  <p>Viewpoints uses information for the following general purposes: to
  customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, contact
  you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and
  external clients.</p>

  <p>Children: Because the Viewpoints Site is not intended for use by anyone
  under the age of 18, Viewpoints does not knowingly collect any personal
  information from persons under the age of 18 and will automatically block
  registration of any person if they indicate they are under the age of 18. If
  we learn that any user is under the age of 18, we will terminate the account
  and delete the user's information. Inherent in the Viewpoints service is the
  responsibility of parents and/or guardians to ensure that their children's
  privacy is protected.</p>

  <p>Viewpoints uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
  visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your
  name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this
  and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
  services of interest to you.</p>

  <h3>What We Share</h3>

  <p>Viewpoints does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you
  with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or
  services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the
  following circumstances:</p>

  <p>We may provide your personal information to our business partners, such
  as service providers and third party processors who work with us to provide
  elements of the Viewpoints service. These companies may use your personal
  information to provide us with the services we have hired them to perform,
  such as helping Viewpoints communicate with you about offers from Viewpoints
  and/or our marketing partners or otherwise organizing, administering,
  processing, appending and/or analyzing data on our behalf, sending email
  correspondence on our behalf or delivering other necessary services. These
  business partners are prohibited from using your personal information except
  to provide these services on behalf of Viewpoints and they are required to
  maintain the confidentiality of your personal information. </p>

  <p>We will release or disclose your personal information, including to
  local, state, or federal law enforcement officials, when we believe in good
  faith that the law requires such action, or when required to do so by order
  of a court or authorized administrative or law enforcement agency or
  personnel. We may also share information in order to investigate, prevent,
  or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
  involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or to
  prevent violations of Viewpoints' Terms of Service.</p>

  <p>We will transfer your personal information if we are acquired by or merge
  with another company, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy. We will
  notify you in accordance with the procedures contained in this Privacy
  Policy if your information will become subject to a different privacy
  policy. When you visit the Viewpoints Site, we may display advertisements
  targeted toward people who share characteristics with you, based on personal
  information we collect from you. When you interact with, view, or click
  targeted advertisements, the advertiser (including the ad serving company)
  may assume you meet the targeting criteria. Viewpoints does not provide any
  personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a
  targeted advertisement, however, you may be asked by the advertiser to
  provide such information to the advertiser if you interact with, view or
  click the advertisement. We may transmit your search queries, if any, to
  business partners who use this information to provide us with search results
  and other information, which we then display to you.</p>

  <p>We may also share certain data with our business partners or service
  providers in aggregate form for audit, marketing and other purposes. Because
  aggregated data is not associated with any particular person, the third
  parties with whom we share this information will not have access to your
  personally identifiable information.</p>
