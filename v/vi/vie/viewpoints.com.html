	<p>We may provide your personal information to our business partners, such as service providers and third party processors who work with us to provide elements of the Viewpoints service.

	<p>We may also share certain data with our business partners or service providers in aggregate form for audit, marketing and other purposes.

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of www.viewpoints.com or the other websites you visit.</p>
	<p>Viewpoints' pages and/or HTML emails may contain single-pixel gifs called "web beacons" that allow us (i) to count users who have visited a certain web page or opened an email, (ii) to conduct research on partner websites for auditing purposes, or (iii) to access your www.viewpoints.com "cookie" to identify you when on third party websites. These web beacons may be used to report aggregate demographic or usage information to our partners.  Viewpoints' web pages may also contain web beacons placed there by third parties to help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with partners except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
