# Privacy Policy

_(Effective March 2017)_

MarketVision Research, Inc. is a full-service marketing research firm headquartered in the U.S. in Cincinnati, OH. As part of our business, we routinely collect data for the purpose of uncovering insights of relevance to our clients on a variety of topics. To the extent data collection (typically in the form of surveys) involves consumers or business professionals, the results are only used in aggregate with other data and with no personally identifiable information attached. 

We respect your privacy and confidentiality and will never make your personal information available to outside parties. Your information is used only as a way to group responses in providing feedback to our clients, and none of your specific information or responses are looked at on an individual basis. If individual responses are requested as part of research, you will be informed of the request and given the opportunity to opt-out and discontinue with the research **PRIOR** to any participation. 

MarketVision Research and Viewpoint Forum, our online panel and survey platform, strictly enforce the rules set forth by CASRO concerning the interviewing of respondents 13 years of age or younger, the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.coppa.org/ "Opens in a new window or tab") (COPPA) of 1998. If a survey requests the participation of a minor household member, under the age of 14 years, the rules outlined by COPPA will be followed. 

Any participation in research with MarketVision Research or Viewpoint Forum is voluntary. If, at any time, you wish to discontinue your participation please simply email us at [pverrill@mv-research.com](mailto:pverrill@mv-research.com) or [julie@viewpointforum.com](mailto:julie@viewpointforum.com "this will open your email application") and we will remove you from future participation.
