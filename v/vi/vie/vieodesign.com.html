<h4>What information about me is collected and stored?</h4>
<p>We store information that is collected through this&nbsp;website or that you provide to our sales or project management team. For example, when you subscribe or download an offer, we collect and store the information that you provide. Likewise, when you become a customer, we store your name, billing address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and credit card expiration date.</p>
<p>This information is used to provide the content&nbsp;and services that you have ordered or requested, to process orders, to send order confirmations, and to provide customer service. This information also may be used for our own marketing and internal business purposes, and to contact you about special offers and new site features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this website.</p>
<p>We collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with this website. For example, we collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit this website. We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve this website and to provide our customers with a fulfilling experience.</p>
<p>Also, like many websites, we use “cookies,” which are files stored on your computer’s hard drive by your browser. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information. Cookies help us identify return visitors and&nbsp;optimize their browsing&nbsp;experiences. Cookies are not used on this website to store your account information; that information is stored securely on this website’s server. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of this website.</p>
<p>Cookies are also used to track the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting this website (i.e. the site you came from); otherwise, we do not track information about your use of other websites. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. We recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so that we can offer you a better experience on this website. We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.</p>

<p>We engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, marketing and promotional material distribution, website evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We provide personal information to these third parties, but we authorize them to use this information only in connection with the services they perform.</p>
<p>We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires it; we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of VIEO Design,&nbsp;LLC, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.</p>

Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this website during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through this website. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.</p>
<p>As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online assets. In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the event that VIEO Design,&nbsp;LLC&nbsp;or substantially all of our respective assets are acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets (unless the information was collected under a previous privacy policy that did not permit such disclosure). Under such circumstances, VIEO Design, LLC would to the extent possible require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this privacy policy.</p>
<h4>What steps are taken to keep personal information secure?</h4>
<p>We use various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, to protect personal information that we collect.
