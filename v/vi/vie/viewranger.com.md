By using this Site, You agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

## Collection of information

This Site collects a variety of personal data. Personal data such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and other information may be collected from You in order to, among other things: (a) respond to a request for additional information about an Augmentra Ltd product/service or about Augmentra Ltd; (b) permit You to download information or products from the Site; (c) report a problem with the Site; (d) enter a sweepstakes or contest or participate in a promotion. If You contact Augmentra Ltd, we may keep a record of that correspondence. When You purchase or download products from the online store area of the Site, Augmentra Ltd and/or Augmentra Ltd's ecommerce service provider(s) may collect Your personal data in order to process such order(s). The Site logs IP addresses and browser information for purposes of system administration, identifying technical difficulties, evaluating traffic patterns and usage of this Site, and otherwise providing content relevant to visitors to this Site. Under no circumstances will Your personal information be sold or generally distributed.

Augmentra Ltd and/or its resellers, representatives, and/or sponsors periodically send out information regarding upcoming industry events, promotions, new marketing initiatives, promotions, new product releases and features. By submitting information to the Site, you expressly agree to the transfer of your information to these parties and the use of this information for such purposes. When Augmentra Ltd wishes to use personal information that has been collected for a new purpose not previously identified herein, the new purpose shall be identified prior to use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, Your consent shall be obtained before the information is used for the new purpose. Personal information that is no longer required to fulfil the identified purposes shall be destroyed, erased, or made anonymous.

## Use, disclosure, and transfer of personal data

You hereby agree that Augmentra Ltd may collect, use, store, maintain, transfer, and delete Your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We provide your credit card information to the credit card processing or authorization company to charge you for your purchases and we may provide your name and address to our fulfillment house to ship products to you. Neither the fulfillment house nor any credit card processing or authorization company is permitted to send Your information to anyone else.

Augmentra Ltd will release personal data to other parties other than as provided herein only with Your express consent, unless (i) releasing such information is otherwise required by applicable law, statute, regulation, ordinance, or court order or (ii) Augmentra Ltd has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Terms and Conditions of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Augmentra Ltd's rights or property, other Augmentra Ltd users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Where Augmentra Ltd does release Your personal data to Augmentra Ltd clients or business partners other than as provided herein, Augmentra Ltd will first require them to agree to use such personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and only for the purposes for which it was collected.

The disclosure of personal data as contemplated in this Privacy Policy may be to a party outside Your home jurisdiction. In particular, if You are based in the European Union, data may be transferred to jurisdictions outside the European Union that may not have equivalent laws and rules to protect personal data. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, You also consent to the transfer of Your personal data as described herein.

Augmentra Ltd reserves the right to use aggregated data (data that is not individually identifiable). Such aggregate uses could include, but are not limited to, meeting Augmentra Ltd's marketing and business objectives.

## Accessing, modifying, or removing your information

Under applicable laws, statutes, regulations, or ordinances, You may have the right to (i) check whether Augmentra Ltd holds personal data about You, (ii) access such personal data, and (iii) correct any personal data about You that is inaccurate. If You would like Augmentra Ltd to update or delete Your information from Augmentra Ltd's records, please send an e-mail message to privacy@augmentra.com, and include Your full name and Your phone number in the body of the message.

## Data security and integrity

When You provide personal data to this Site, such data is stored on secured servers that may be located overseas but that are protected by this Privacy Policy. Augmentra Ltd takes reasonable steps to protect Your personal data from loss, misuse, or other unauthorized uses, and to remove Your personal data when it is no longer required for its intended purposes. Augmentra Ltd cannot, however, guarantee that loss, misuse, or unauthorized use will never occur (e.g., that someone will not overcome our security measures), and makes no representations or warranties to this effect.
