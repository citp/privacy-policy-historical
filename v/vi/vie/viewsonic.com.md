 **1\. What information does ViewSonic.com collect and how is it used?**

  * Usernames, mailing address, telephone number, email address, contact information, mac address, IP address, preference, bank or credit card, hardware specification, Windows version, analytic files, log files, and other information you may provide to us in calls, emails, meetings, texts, and events.

  * When you search for or request details on services or products from the Website, for example, registering a ViewSonic product online or entering a competition.
  * When creating an account or signing up via our website, in person or via an affiliated partner.



The specific types of information collected will depend upon the services you use or subscribe to. For example, when you shop through our web store, we may collect data such as the purchases you have made, items in your shopping cart, and how often you make purchases. To process your order, we may collect your full name, email address, phone number, product serial number, home address, mobile phone number, credit card information, and shipping address.

If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide the corresponding ViewSonic products and services or respond to your inquiries. By disclosing your personal information via the Website, over the telephone or via email or post you consent to the collection, storage and processing of your personal information by ViewSonic in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Policy.

ViewSonic might request additional information from you in other areas or in the future. You may choose not to provide this information. ViewSonic might also ask for information about your interests, or for feedback about the Website so that we can improve the Website and/or its service. Providing ViewSonic with this information is always optional.

 **Information We Automatically Collect.** In addition to the information ViewSonic collects directly from you, we also monitor and track usage of our website, viewing and traffic patterns, customer behavior, and other similar information. This information is compiled into a statistical aggregate. This aggregate information is also used, in conjunction with your personal information, for ViewSonic’s internal business and administrative purposes including improvements to the Website, ViewSonic’s product and service offerings, our operations, or our customer service. This information may be obtained from the following sources:

  * Via unconditional data capture measures such as the use of cookies and studying the pages you read frequently (please see our Cookie Policy below).
  * Via your individual IP location. This is a necessary function of the Website that enables ViewSonic to return details of information you have searched for, and in order for ViewSonic to diagnose problems with its server and to administer the website.
  * ViewSonic uses a third party tool, Google Analytics, to analyze traffic on the Website. Google Analytics does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services, Google Analytics does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. Google Analytics only collects aggregate data.
  * During the time you are registered as active with ViewSonic, we will log and record on our secure database calls, emails, meetings, texts, events and any other relevant information.



 **Information Provided by Third Parties.** We also obtain data from publicly available sources, service providers, governing bodies and referees.

ViewSonic will only pass your data to other third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, or if required to do so by law. ViewSonic may disclose your data to certain permitted third parties, such as members of the ViewSonic group, ViewSonic’s own professional advisers who are bound by confidentiality codes, and when ViewSonic is legally obliged to disclose your data.

From time to time, ViewSonic may sell a business or a part of a business to another person or company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the purchasing person or company.

Any non-personally identifiable communication or material you transmit to ViewSonic over this website, by electronic mail or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, or suggestions will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary. ViewSonic may use anything you transmit or post to its affiliates for any purpose, including but not limited to reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast and posting. Furthermore, ViewSonic is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you send to this website for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to developing manufacturing and marketing products using such information.

 **3\. How does ViewSonic.com respond to ‘Do Not Track Signals’?**

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
