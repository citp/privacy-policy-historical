<h4 id="sharing" class="type-style-3">Sharing of Information</h4>
<p>We will only share certain personal information with our partners, third party service providers and co-marketing partners, an acquirer, with others within your organization, our affiliates (including other members of the Endurance corporate family) and for legal reasons, as more fully described below.</p>
<p>We may share your name, email address and other information with certain of our partners so that they may assist you in using our products and services, contact you with offers, services or products that may be of interest to you, and provide you with their products or services. Our partners are prohibited from using your contact information for any other purpose without your consent. We will not provide our partners with your credit card information. If you are working with a partner and would like that partner to have full access to your account, we will provide access to just that partner upon your request or consent.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we enter into contracts with carefully selected third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing customer service, fraud detection and deterrence or access to advertising assets), to assist us in our own marketing and advertising activities or to engage in co-marketing activities with us. Our contracts with such third parties prohibit them from using any of your personal information for any purpose beyond the purpose for which it was shared.</p>
<p>We may also share non-personal information with any third party, including the media, industry observers, marketing and advertising partners, vendors, customers, potential customers or partners. For example, we may disclose mobile search trends, email open rates by industry, campaign best practices or the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, our Sites or evaluated or purchased our products and services.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets, or other similar sale transaction, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you by email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such transfer and any choices you may have regarding your information.</p>
<p>We may share your information with others within your organization (including any affiliates or any other individuals designated as users on your account). We may also share your personal information with any of our affiliates (including other members of the Endurance corporate family). Any such affiliate may use your information only according to the terms of this privacy statement.</p>
<p>Lastly, we may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement authorities and other relevant third parties, such as internet service providers, when such disclosure is necessary or advisable, in our sole discretion, to conduct an investigation, respond to a third party or law enforcement subpoena or court order, bring legal action, prevent harm to others or pursue other relief when you or a third party are or may be: violating our terms and conditions of use; causing injury or other harm to, or otherwise violating our property or other legal rights, or those of other users or third parties; or violating federal, state, local, or other applicable law. This disclosure may include transferring information to the U.S. and outside the European Economic Area. To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties in connection with a subpoena.</p>

<h4 id="tracking" class="type-style-3">Tracking Technologies</h4>
<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our partners (including marketing partners and affiliates) as well as our analytics and other service providers. These technologies are used in many ways, including advertising, sales and marketing, analyzing trends, administering and improving the Sites, tracking users' movements around the Sites (including point of entry), gathering demographic information about our user base, verifying login status, measuring the success of a particular marketing campaign, providing improved customer service, providing more relevant content, deterring or detecting fraud, and providing users with a customized experience. We also use these technologies as part of our product offerings, including to provide our trialers and customers with information about their campaigns, such as email opens, clicks and bounces and tracking whether messages are shared and opened using our social share features. We collect information based on the use of these technologies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
<p>Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Sites may be limited.</p>
<p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs), such as HTML5 to, among other things, optimize screen presentation, video and other preference information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and store information. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="online" class="type-style-3">Online Advertising</h4>
<p>We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies, such as cookies, to gather information about your activities on our Sites and other sites in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com" target="_blank">here</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">here</a>). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p>We give all Internet users the choice to opt-out of receiving our ad impression cookie. If you opt out, your web browser will be associated with a generic "opt-out" cookie, which will prevent us from associating any non-personally identifying information with your browser. Our "opt-out" cookie has no expiration date. Keep in mind that participating in our opt-out program does not prevent you from seeing our online ads; instead, information about the online ads we serve to you will not be recorded.

You must cancel your Constant Contact or SinglePlatform account, as applicable, to unsubscribe from these communications. To cancel your Constant Contact or SinglePlatform accounts, please see "Access to Personal Information" below. You may still receive marketing communications from us even after you cancel your account unless you also opt-out of our marketing communications, as described above.</p>
<p>To manage the information we receive about you from a social networking site or any other third party, you will need to follow the instructions from that party for updating your information and changing your privacy settings. The information we collect is covered by this privacy statement and the information the third party collects is subject to such third party's privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on any third party site will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Sites.</p>
<p>If an account or profile was created without your knowledge or authorization, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@constantcontact.com" rel="nofollow">support@constantcontact.com</a> to request removal of the account or profile.</p>
