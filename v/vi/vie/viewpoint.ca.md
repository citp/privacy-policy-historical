# Your Privacy — ViewPoint.ca

On most sites, this is where you would normally find incomprehensible legalese written by expensive lawyers — but not at ViewPoint.ca.

Our practices related to the handling of your personal information are prudent, intelligible and logical. In fact, if you were running ViewPoint.ca we would expect that you would handle personal information in the same manner that we do.

## Our Privacy Policy

  * We will never collect and store your personal information unless you give us permission;
  * We will never sell, trade, or give away your personal information;
  * We will only use your personal information for the purpose in which you intended;
  * We will protect and secure your personal information as though it were our own.



For questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please email [privacy@viewpoint.ca](mailto:privacy@viewpoint.ca) or call (902) 482-3100.
