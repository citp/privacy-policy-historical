# Your Privacy - ViewPoint.ca

On most sites, this is where you would normally find incomprehensible legalese — but not at ViewPoint.ca.

Our practices related to the handling of your personal information are prudent, intelligible and logical. In fact, if you were running ViewPoint.ca we would expect that you would handle personal information in the same manner that we do. As you have seen (or will see if you choose to register), we ask our users to provide only the personal information which is necessary to support our service.

  * We will never sell, trade, or give away your personal information;
  * We will only request your personal information as required to operate our services;
  * We do retain and analyze usage records;
  * We will protect and secure your personal information as though it were our own.
