#### Credit Card and Personal Information

Any credit card or personally identifying information divulged to Viking via our website will be stored on secure servers and not released to any other party without your explicit written authorisation unless as expressly provided in the Viking Privacy Policy.

Pages on our website that request payment information are protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) security, which encrypts any data transmitted please see below.

Once you enter a credit/charge card number, we will never display the entire card number if the page is recalled after you have submitted it. This also covers the use of the ackbutton on your browser. The inner digits will always be displayed as asterisks, protecting your card number from other users of your computer or anyone who happens to see the screen.

#### Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protection

The purchase area of our website is secure. We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt sensitive information such as your name, address and credit card details. Information passed between your computer and our website cannot be read in the event that someone else intercepts it.

Additionally, the Viking fulfilment system is not connected to the Internet and is not accessible in any way, which keeps your information secure once it reaches us.

Some browsers may experience problems with SSL enabled websites. If you are experiencing problems using our online shopping and account facilities under SSL protection, our non-encrypted server is available.

### WEEE Regulations

    

#### Battery Recycling

As part of our commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our own operations and those of our customers, our customers are invited to either return their used portable batteries to any Office Depot site for recycling or to order a recycling box from environment compliance scheme, Budget Pack. The process is simple, log on and register at www.recyclenow.co.uk to order a container to collect batteries, and log in again to request a collection when it is full. Alternatively, you can find your local waste portable battery recycling facility at www.recyclenow.co.uk.

#### Why we take recycling of batteries seriously

Some household batteries contain chemicals like lead, mercury or cadmium. If batteries are disposed of in your normal waste bin, they are likely to end up in landfill. When the batteries are put into landfill they start to break down, and can leak some of these chemicals into the ground. This can cause soil and water pollution, which may lead to health risks.

Recycling avoids this and can also recover some of the raw materials used for making batteries. These can be used to make other products. The result of recycling means we can save some of the planet`s resources by reducing the need to mine new materials.

#### Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations for B2B Customers

Customers wishing to dispose of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) when it reaches the end of its life can do so by contacting your customer service representative, who will arrange for it to be sent to an authorised treatment facility that will treat and dispose of it in an environmentally sound way.

#### (WEEE) Regulations for Personal Customers

So that you can get your old electrical products recycled, we have made a financial contribution toward the development of improved recycling collection points (known as Designated Collection Facilities) throughout the UK through our membership of the Distributor Take Back Scheme. To remind you to recycle, all new electrical products are marked with a crossed out wheelie bin symbol.

  


You can take any old electrical equipment to participating civic amenity sites (often known as household waste recycling centres) run by their local councils. Please remember that this equipment will be further handled during the recycling process, so please be sure to remove any non-electrical product (for example food waste).

You can locate your closest participating recycling centre using www.recycle-more.co.uk. Please remember to have your postcode to hand.
