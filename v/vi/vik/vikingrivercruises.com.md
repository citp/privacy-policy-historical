### 2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE

Although you do not have to provide us with any personal information to visit our websites, you may not be able to fully access or use all of features and offerings of our websites and other Access Points and the Services if you choose to not provide certain “personal information.”

Personal information may include such information as your name, mailing address, billing address including ZIP code, home, business and/or mobile telephone number, email address, passport information, credit or debit card information and your Viking account user name and password and other information, including without limitation, the name, address, and telephone number of someone who is not traveling with you who we can contact in case of an emergency. We also may ask you to provide your date of birth, gender, vacation and dietary preference, health requirements and information about your interests, so that we can combine such information with the information described above. It is your responsibility to obtain the consent of other individuals in your travel party prior to providing us with their personal information, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.

The personal information you provide to us will occur when

  * you interact with us or our affiliates or third-party business associates,

We also receive personal information when you apply for a job in the “careers” section of our websites. Any such personal information gathered through that section will be used solely to evaluate whether your background and experience make you a candidate for a career with Viking.

We may combine the information we collect from or about you, including through the tracking technologies described in Section 3 (Information We Collect), with your personal information, and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law.

### 3\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We may collect information (including personal information) about you from other sources, such as data aggregators, public databases, and third party business partners or using technology, such as cookies. Examples of this may include information (whether identified, de-identified or anonymous, and whether collected online or offline) about your interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your activities online (such as websites visited and advertisements viewed) and includes the following:

 **(a) From Third Parties Services**. We may collect information about you (including personal information) from various third party services, including from Access Points owned or operated by third parties. For example, we may receive information about you (including personal information) when you interact or connect with us or our Services, for example, by liking us on Facebook® or following us on Twitter® or on Instagram® or watching us on YouTube®. The collected information may be information associated with that third-party service, or that you elect to make public using that service or have authorized the third-party service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, email address, birthday, friends list, pages you have "liked" or commented on, and other account and profile data). The information we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the third party. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings with third-parties before interacting or connecting with us through them. We are not responsible for their privacy practices or content. All product and company names are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders, and use of them does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by them.

 **(b) Usage and Log Data**. In addition to the personal information that you provide or we collect as described in this Privacy Policy, we also collect non-personally identifiable information when you view the websites, use the Services or view Viking advertising or content through any of the Access Points. “Non-personally identifiable information” is information that cannot be used to identify a specific individual, and examples may include your IP address, device, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), location (which may include precise location data), activity on the Services, including information, activities and content viewed, used or accessed, page views, ad data, referral URLs, network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers and identifiers associated with browser cookies (see our description of "Data Collected Through Cookies, Pixel Tags and Similar Technologies" below in this Section 3), and carrier information.

 **(c) Data Collected Through Cookies, Pixel Tags and Similar Technologies**. Like many companies, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store preferences. These technologies may be used by us directly or through third party service providers. These technologies are discussed below.

  *  **Cookies and Local Storage**. One technology we use is called a cookie, which is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. We may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred to as "Flash cookies" or sometimes called “browser cookies”, because these technologies are similar to browser cookies, even though they may be stored in different parts of your computer. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. While it is possible to disable cookies or delete information contained in cookies, this may interfere with the performance and features of the Services, such as preventing us from storing your preferences or login information.
  *  **Pixel tags and web beacons**. We use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags or clear GIFs, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, to collect certain types of information from your browser or device, such as tracking whether (and when) the recipient opened the email message. These technologies are used in conjunction with cookies and send information such as your IP address, when you viewed the page or email, the type of device or browser you use, and your location.
  *  **Mobile Device Identifiers and Software Development Kits ("SDKs" )**. When you access the Access Points by or through a mobile device, we may receive or collect and store a unique identification number associated with your device (“Device ID”), mobile carrier, device type and manufacturer, and phone number. We may use or work with third parties including our third party business partners and service providers who use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., "ad-ID" or "IDFA") and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Services. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented. A mobile SDK is in effect the mobile application version of a pixel tag or beacon. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze how you interact with our content and devices.
  *  **Analytics Tools**. We, our affiliates and/or our third party business associates may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Access Points and for other purposes.
  *  **Location Specific Information**. If you use a mobile device, a social media account or location-enabled products and services, you may be sending us information such as GPS data which reveals your actual location.



The use of these various technologies discussed in this Section 3(c) (Data Collected Through Cookies, Pixel Tags and Similar Technologies) in connection with the Services is explained further below in Section 4 (Use of Information). To learn about opting out of interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the information we have provided in Section 6 below (“Your Choices About Your Information”).

Viking and our third-party advertising companies use pixel tags in HTML-enabled email and on our Access Points to track whether (and when) the recipient opened the message. check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed or accessed the Services, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Services were viewed or accessed.
