Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our opt-out below.

Addresses collected to send a physical postcard are not shared or sold, but used for the sole purpose of postcard fulfillment. Email addresses are stored to communicate the retrieval of postcards with senders and recipients. Opting-in to receive a Virginia Travel Guide or receive Virginia eNewsletters allows Virginia Tourism Corporation to store information in a database to manage fulfillment of said products. 

**Order**

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address). This information is used to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. We will also share contact information with companies who partner with VTC for the contests.
