      </h2>
      <p>
        You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.

      </p>
      <p>
        If you participate in a white-labeled enterprise campaign (identified by the enterprise having their logo in the top left of the campaign, as opposed to the Viralstyle logo) we may share your name, email address and order breakdown of size and quantity with the enterprise customers for the purposes of continued contact. This information is encrypted on the Viralstyle database and is only decrypted to send to the enterprise client securely. After this has been complete, the plain-text data is purged from the Viralstyle server. To opt out of this marketing, please contact the white-labeled enterprise customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also disclose your personal information:
      </p>
      <ol>
                  <li>
            As required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
          </li>
                  <li>
            When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request
          </li>
                  <li>
            If Viralstyle is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information

      <p>
        We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information. We use another company to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personal information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our site.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting
      </h2>
      <p>
        We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <h3>
        Analytics Data Gathering
      </h3>
      <p>
        We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics to measure traffic and website usage. One feature we use in Google Analytics is non-personally identifiable 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests), which we use to improve our service.

      <h2>
        Security
      </h2>
      <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also encrypt customer information in our database so that customers name and address is never stored in plain text. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please contact us if you have any questions about security on our Web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide two means for you to make a purchase on our site. You can either use our order form or a third party payment option. If you use our shopping cart, the transmission of sensitive information collected on our order form is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and is processed by Authorize.net. If you choose to use a third party payment option, such as PayPal, to pay for your order, its privacy policy and security practices will apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy policy before providing your information.
