#### On-line Security

Virtualmedicalcentre.com takes the issue of your on-line security seriously. 

On-line access to your information is protected by your virtualmedicalcentre.com user name and password which must be provided before you can gain access to your information. As a registered member there is an option for virtualmedicalcentre.com to remember "user name and password" so that you do not have to log in every time you use the site. Obviously if you are using a public computer this would enable any member of the public to visit the site and view your personal information. This would therefore not be an option you would choose. If, however, you are the only user of the computer it may be something you may wish to use for convenience. Virtualmedicalcentre.com cannot take any responsibility for any unauthorized access in these circumstances.

#### Anonymity

You may browser the VirtualMedicalCentre.com websites freely, without having to provide any personal identifying information. Although membership is necessary to access certain areas, the personal information required is kept to a minimum.
