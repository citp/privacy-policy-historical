<h2>1. Protecting our Customers</h2>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
	<p><strong>1.1 The Customer’s Choice</strong></p>
	<p>The choice to provide Virgin Money with certain customer                information via the website is always the user's. The user should,                however, be aware that in financial dealings withholding certain                details may limit the services Virgin Money is able to                provide.</p>
	<p><strong>1.2 Our commitment to you, our customer</strong></p>
	<p>Virgin Money does not and will not sell or provide personal                client information to third parties for independent use.</p>
	<p><strong>1.3 Contribute to privacy protection</strong></p>
	<p>The user can also help maintain the security of banking                information by:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Not sharing the user's ID or password with anyone.</li>
		<li>Changing the user's password regularly.</li>
		<li>Remembering to sign off after an online banking                  session.</li>
		<li>Not leaving the user's computer unattended while conducting                  online transactions</li>
		<li>Reporting lost or stolen cards.</li>
		<li>Helping Virgin Money maintain accurate records by letting                  Virgin Money know when changes occur in the user's situation so                  Virgin Money can update its records accordingly.</li>
		<li>Not sending any confidential information via non-encrypted                  e-mail.</li>
		<li>Not supplying the user's personal and financial information                  to any site he/she doesn't know or trust.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>1.4 Protecting Customer Information</strong></p>
	<p><strong>What is customer information?</strong></p>
	<p>Customer information refers to personal and private information                submitted to Virgin Money via the website that identifies or                relates to the user, whether the user is an individual or a                business.</p>
	<p>This information includes details such as name, age, ID                numbers, registration numbers, addresses and other contact                details, liabilities, income and payments records, financial                information and banking details such as account numbers.</p>
	<p><strong>Why does Virgin Money collect customer                information?</strong></p>
	<p>Virgin Money uses customer information to identify the user and                to offer better online service. User information is also necessary                to enable Virgin Money to contact the user in the event of any                query. Virgin Money further uses customer information to bring to                the user's attention details of Virgin Money's other services and                products. The more we know about you the better we can serve                you.</p>
	<p><strong>How does Virgin Money safeguard your                information?</strong></p>
	<p>Keeping your financial information secure is one of Virgin                Money's most important responsibilities. This policy governs the                behaviour of employees with regard to accuracy, confidentiality                and security of all customer information.</p>
	<p>For more about security, please read VirginMoney.co.za security                policy.<br>
	</p>
	<p><strong>1.5 Sharing user information</strong></p>
	<p>The only instances in which Virgin Money is permitted to                disclose customer information is when it is:</p>
	<p>Authorised by the user Virgin Money will not collect or use                customer information without obtaining the user's consent.</p>
	<p>In respect of marketing of services or products, consent to                collect or use information can be expressed (for example signing                an agreement) or implied (e.g. if the user is given an opportunity                to opt out of a specific form of information sharing, but chooses                not to do so,&nbsp; the user has chosen to share this                information).</p>
	<p>The type of customer information the user will be asked to                provide will vary according to the product or services                required.</p>
	<p>Virgin Money, will need to share the user's data with it’s                banking partner, for the express purposes of servicing her                accounts. The user's permission to do this will be confirmed                whenever opening an account with Virgin Money. By sharing                information about the user's accounts among different business                units, Virgin Money can serve the user more efficiently</p>
	<p>Other companies routinely contact Virgin Money for credit and                financial information about users. Virgin Money will, however,                only share customer information in the instances where disclosure                is made at the user's request or with the user's consent.</p>
	<p><strong>Required by law</strong></p>
	<p>This most often relates to government tax reporting                requirements or in terms of a court order or if required in terms                of legislation or in accordance with the common law. Virgin Money                will, however, in all instances required by law, only disclose the                information specifically requested.</p>
	<p><strong>Necessary to protect the Virgin Money's                interest</strong></p>
	<p>This will not be used as a reason for disclosing information                about the user or the user's accounts (including name and address)                to any one else, including other companies in the Virgin Money                Group for marketing purposes. However, basic procedures that                protect Virgin Money's interests sometimes lead to the disclosure                of specific customer information to third parties, such as                returning a cheque due to insufficient funds in an account.</p>
	<p><strong>In the public interest</strong></p>
	<p>Sometimes Virgin Money is asked to disclose customer                information for matters of public interest, e.g. to assist in the                prevention of crimes. Before complying with these requests, Virgin                Money takes every precaution to ensure the authorities involved                have legitimate grounds to make such a request.</p>
	<p><strong>Credit reference agencies</strong></p>
	<p>Information about the user's personal debt owed to Virgin Money                may be disclosed to credit reference agencies, where the user has                fallen behind with payments and has not made proposals                satisfactory to Virgin Money for repayment of debt following                formal demand or where the user has given Virgin Money written                consent or where the user has a cheque referred to drawer, the                information is placed on a cheque verification service.</p>
	<p><strong>1.6 Virgin Money’s Commitment to Customer                Privacy</strong></p>
	<p>Virgin Money provided by&nbsp; the Bank&nbsp; is committed to                maintaining the privacy and security of its customers' personal                and private information ("customer information") submitted to                Virgin Money via the <a href="http://www.virginmoney.co.za/" target="_blank">http://www.virginmoney.co.za/</a> website                ("the/this website"). This privacy and security policy ("this                policy") outlines Virgin Money's practices and commitment to the                customer in this regard.</p>

<h2>2. Other areas of Privacy</h2>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
	<p><strong>2.1 Cookies</strong></p>
	<p>Cookies On some parts of the Virgin Money website Virgin Money                uses so-called "cookie" technology. Cookie technology consists of                small pieces of data or a small text file which is given to the                customer's browser by Virgin Money's webserver when the customer                visits the Virgin Money website. This data is stored on the user's                browser. The cookie is sent back to the Virgin Money webserver                each time the user visits the Virgin Money website.</p>
	<p>Cookies are not computer programs and do not run on a computer                like programs do. It cannot gather information or function                independently. It cannot collect any personal information about                the user or the user's machine and cannot gather data or                information about what the user does on the internet.</p>
	<p>Cookies merely enable Virgin Money to provide a more valuable                online experience to the customer. While you can set up your                Internet browser to disable cookie technology, Virgin Money does                not recommend that the user does this since some parts of this                website and Virgin Money's online services are cookie enabled.                Virgin Money cannot be held liable for a user's personalised                information changing or being deleted as a result of the                customer's disablement or deletion of cookies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
	<p><strong>2.2 Planning tools</strong></p>
	<p>Virgin Money does not capture user information that the user                provides on any of Virgin Money's Planning Tools (for instance the                interest calculators). The tools are for the user's personal use                to help make financial decisions in the privacy of the user's                home.</p>
	<p><strong>2.3 Right to amend this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
	<p>Virgin Money reserves the right to amend this policy at any                time. All amendments to this policy will be posted on the website.                Unless otherwise stated, the current version shall supersede and                replace all previous versions of this policy.</p>
	<p><strong>2.4 Privacy statements: Online services</strong></p>
	<p>Different online services, Virgin Money businesses or                subsidiaries may have their own privacy policies because the                nature of the service or products demands a deviation from this                policy. These specific policies will apply to and exclusively                govern the user's use of the particular online service or                product.</p>
	<p><strong>2.5 Third parties</strong></p>
	<p>Except as outlined in the section dealing with "Sharing                Customer Information", Virgin Money will never sell or otherwise                make available customer information to other organisations or                parties including other companies in the Virgin Money                Group.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>2.6 Email communication</strong></p>
	<p>Virgin Money may use customer information to send the user                information on new services or products that may be of interest to                the user and from time to time will mail, e-mail or SMS                information to the customer about Virgin Money, Virgin Money                products and services or about the Virgin Group of Companies and                its products or services. The user will have the option to                indicate that he/she does not want to receive such specific                product communications in future, at time of receipt of the                communication. The user will, however, continue to receive other                product information until the option to not receive future                communications has again been selected for that specific                product.&nbsp; Remember, regular non-encrypted e-mail is not                secure. For this reason Virgin Money will not include confidential                account information in an e-mail response.&nbsp; Virgin Money will                further never request the user, via the use of e-mail, to provide                Virgin Money with personal information, such as your account                number; PIN or password.</p>
	<p><strong>2.7 Code of Banking Practice</strong></p>
	<p>Virgin Money supports and underwrites the spirit of the Code of                Banking Practice. Read more on the Code of Banking Practice.</p>
