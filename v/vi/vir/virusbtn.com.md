### What data does Virus Bulletin collect?

Virus Bulletin uses non-identifying and aggregate information in order to improve the design and functionality of the Site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Every time a user visits the Site we store a log of the visit that shows: the IP address of the machine used to access the Internet, the browser used, the time and length of the visit, the pages visited, the referring site (where appropriate), whether any page requests were unsuccessful, and in some cases, the user's ‘mouse-trail’ on the front page. 

In general this information is collected and processed in aggregate, and no attempt is made to link this information back to the user, or to identify them from the information provided. The data is used to help us to understand which areas of the Site are of popular, as well as identify which pages are not being requested. It also tells us how many people are visiting the Site in total. We may occasionally attempt to contact you through these details if necessary, including, without limitation, when you are using the wrong paths to access the Site or are breaching restrictions on the use of the Site. We may also use this information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and Conditions for use of the Site. 

In general, you can visit Virus Bulletin’s website without telling us who you are or giving any personal information about yourself. However, when you enquire about, order or request a sample of our products/services; or when you fill out a survey or feedback form, you may be required to provide personal data such as your name, company, job title, address, telephone number, email address, credit card details (in the case of placing an order) and age. If you forward information to us electronically or as a hard copy, we will collect that information and use it for the purposes for which you have provided it. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.
