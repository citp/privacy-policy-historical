#### **Your Information**

For us, “Personal Information” means:

  * Information which identifies you, like your name or email address; or
  * A combination of several pieces of information which couldn’t identify you on their own, but which we believe would be sufficient to identify you when combined.



Any information that falls outside of this is “Other Information.” If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Privacy Policy.

  * Application Activations. We store a list of which applications that have been activated for use by each user as well as when those activations expire.



If you purchase our paid Services, we also may collect full name and billing address. We use third party payment services to collect and process users’ payment card transactions.

####  **Other Information We Collect**

We and our third party service providers may collect other information in a variety of ways, including:

  * Through your browser: Certain information is collected by most browsers and sent to web servers so that sites can behave reliably, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.  

  * Through server log files: An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
  * Using cookies: Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We and our service providers use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.

Cookie Type| Description  
---|---  
Strictly necessary / Essential cookies| Essential cookies enable you to navigate the Site and to use its services and features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, the Site will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide the Site or certain services or features.  
Preference cookies| Preference cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize the Site accordingly.

  * Remember your visit and share data collected with third parties, such as advertisers. Often these cookies are linked to website functionality provided by the third party.

  
Analytics cookies| Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the Site and enable us to improve the way it works. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the Site, help us record any difficulties you have with the Site, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Site, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information.

We also use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

  * By aggregating information: We may aggregate Personal Information so that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site or Services, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site or Services.

####  **Third Party Sites**

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates.

####  **Security**

Security is our business! We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control. We also require our third-party service providers with access to Personal Information to use reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the Personal Information they maintain for us. Unfortunately, no data transmission or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.

####  **Retention**

We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.  

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:  

  * The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services); 
  * Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or 
  * Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).  



####  **Use of Site by Minors**

The Services are not directed to individuals under the age of sixteen (16), and we request that these individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Services.

####  **Third Party Payment Service**

We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the Services. If you wish to make a payment through the Services, your Personal Information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we email you about the changes or post the revised Privacy Policy on the Site.
