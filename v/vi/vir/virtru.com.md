# Privacy Policy | Virtru

## Virtru Privacy Policy

### Virtru values your privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect from you when you use Virtru.

## Our Principles

##### Our Privacy Policy is grounded in the following privacy principles:

### 1\. Transparency

We only use and share information about our users as spelled out in our Privacy Policy or other notices or in the agreements under which we provide the Services. We want you to know how we use your information, and to avoid any surprises.

### 2\. Choice

We let our users know when and how we collect information and we are designing our Services to offer our customers choices about how their information is used.

### 3\. Sensible defaults

Our defaults try to balance user experience and privacy in as sensible a fashion as we can.

### 4\. Limit collection of data

We seek to collect and retain the least amount of user data necessary for the functioning, security, and effective operation of our business.

### 5\. Data security

Security is our business. We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information under our control.

### 6\. Working with partners

We make privacy a key factor in selecting service providers who have access to user information.

#### For us, "Personal Information" means:

  * information which identifies you, like your name or email address; or 
  * a combination of several pieces of information which couldn't identify you on their own, but which we believe would be sufficient to identify you when combined.



Any information that falls outside of this is "Other Information." If we combine your Personal Information with Other Information, we will consider the combination as Personal Information.

#### Personal Information We Collect

#### For users of our free and paid services, we may collect your email address, your IP address, and Virtru Application Data. Virtru Application Data consists of

  * Key Access Policies for each message or files you secure, as well as all updates to those Policies, such as revocation and adding or removing authorized users. Key Access Policies include the minimal metadata required to enforce the policy, such as authorized user email addresses, encryption keys and expiration date/time as well as a “Display Name” per policy for use in the online dashboard which may be a file name or email subject line.
  * Application Activations – We store a list of which applications have been activated for use by each user as well as when those activactions expire.



For users of our paid services only, we may collect full name and billing address. We use third party payment services to minimize billing data stored at Virtru. As a result, we do not need to store your credit card or other payment information.

#### How We Use Personal Information

#### We may use Personal Information: 

  * To provide the Services.
  * To respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you e-mail updates you have requested or information regarding the Services, changes to our terms, policies or other administrative announcements.
  * To process your payments, provide you with the products or services you have purchased, communicate with you regarding your purchase and provide you with related customer service.
  * To send you communications regarding additional services that may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish to receive newsletters or other marketing-related email communications from Virtru, you can opt out from receiving them by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the next such email you receive from us. Note that you may not opt-out of receiving some administrative announcements (such as changes to our policies). 
  * To perform security analyses to verify that the Services are working properly and have not been compromised; 
  * For our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our website, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.



#### Other Information We Collect 

#### We and our third party service providers may collect other information in a variety of ways, including:

  * Through your browser: Certain information is collected by most browsers and sent to web servers so that sites can behave reliably, such as browser version, resolution and operating system.
  * Through server log files: An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site. 
  * Using cookies: Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We and our service providers use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. If you choose to decline cookies, some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Site may not be available to you. 
  * Email Image Downloads – The downloading of images embedded in Virtru’s introduction template may be used for internal business metrics such as click-through rates and to measure the success of our marketing campaigns.
  * From you: We may collect demographic information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, when you voluntarily provide this information to us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.
  * By aggregating information: We may aggregate Personal Information so that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.



We may use and share Other Information for any purpose, provided that it does not constitute Personal Information as defined above.

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates. 

Security is our business! We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.

The Services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that these individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Services. 

The Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States, and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.

#### Updates to this Privacy Policy

We may review and update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to this Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Site.
