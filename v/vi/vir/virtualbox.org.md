# PrivacyPolicy - VirtualBox

Policy version 1.3, June 29, 2009 

This privacy policy sets out how Sun Microsystems, Inc. (“Sun”) treats personal information related to the virtualbox.org website and the VirtualBox registration process. 

**§ 1 virtualbox.org.** The “virtualbox.org” website, as any other website, logs anonymous usage information such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views while you visit (collectively, “anonymous data”). In addition, but only if you choose to register, the website’s bug tracking and forum services store the data you choose to reveal upon registration, such as your user name and contact information. 

**§ 2 Cookies.** The virtualbox.org website, the bug tracker and the forum services use cookies to identify and track the visiting web browser and, if you have registered, to facilitate login. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. While you can still visit the website with cookies disabled, logging into the bug tracker and forum services will most likely not work without them. 

**§ 3 VirtualBox registration process.** The VirtualBox application may ask that the user register with Sun through the Sun Online mechanism used by many Sun products. This registration is optional. If you choose to register, your name, e-mail address, country and company will be submitted to Sun and stored together with the IP address of the submitter as well as product version and platform being used. The standard Sun Privacy Policy as posted on [http://www.sun.com/privacy/](http://www.sun.com/privacy/) applies to this data. 

**§ 4 Update notifications.** The VirtualBox application may contact Sun Microsystems to find out whether a new version of VirtualBox has been released and notify the user if that is the case. In the process, anonymous data such as your IP address and a non-identifying counter, together with the product version and the platform being used, is sent so that the server can find out whether an update is available. By default, this check is performed once a day. You change this interval or disable these checks altogether in the VirtualBox preferences. 

**§ 5 Usage of personal information.** Sun may use anonymous and personal data collected by the means above for statistical purposes as well as to automatically inform you about new notices related to your posts on the bug tracker and forum services, to administer the website and to contact you due to technical issues. Sun may also inform you about new product releases related to VirtualBox. 

In no event will personal data without your express consent be provided to any third parties, unless Sun may be required to do so by law or in connection with legal proceedings. 

**§ 6 Updates.** Sun may update this privacy policy by posting a new version on the website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes.
