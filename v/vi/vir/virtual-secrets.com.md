# Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy:

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which virtual-secrets.com collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the [http://virtual-secrets.com](http://virtual-secrets.com/) website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by virtual-secrets.com.

Personal identification information

We may collect personally identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.

IP Address information

IP addresses will not be displayed visibly on our site ever. (Effective 10/21/2010) Standard server logging will be used but is only accessible by the system administrator. Logging is scanned nightly by an application and any activity that is ‘red flagged’ is sent to the system administrator electronically. This ‘red flag’ activity is intrusion detection, errors and other maintenace items. Standard web use is not ever flagged.

If you would like to obtain an IP address of a poster please send your subpoena to the address on the following [website](http://www.linode.com/about/).

IP addresses of posters can be obtained in the event of a law enforcement welfare check. That means if you say you are going to kill yourself or someone then I obtain IP information accordingly and send to the ISP so they can forward to law enforcement for a welfare check. I’ve only had this happen once. Don’t make this a habit.

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

Non-personal identification information

We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. This information will never be disclosed.
