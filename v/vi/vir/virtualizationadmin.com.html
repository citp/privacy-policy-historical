	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><strong>Privacy Policy last updated on May 5, 2014</strong></p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>TechGenix Limited (“TechGenix” or “We”) are committed to fair information practices and we respect the privacy and security of our users. Our goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, we sometimes collect certain information during your visits to our websites and the use of our services to understand what differentiates you from each of our millions of other users. We may also ask you to provide personal information to enable us to give you access to some parts of our web sites and use of our services. We will not disclose your personal information to any person outside our organisation except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>To demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have prepared this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) disclosing our practices regarding your information. This Privacy Policy describes what personal identifying information is collected, how and when we might use your information, how we protect your information, who has access to your information, how you can correct any inaccuracies in your information and the options you have with regard to how your personal information is used. </p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we obtain from users interacting with TechGenix and its websites and services. By accessing the TechGenix website at <a href="http://www.techgenix.com">www.techgenix.com</a>, including all related pages and sub-domains (“the Websites”) and using any services offered by TechGenix (collectively the “Services”) you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy please do not use the Websites or Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated and revised from time to time and you are deemed to have accepted the most current version each time you use our Websites.  Please take the time to read this Privacy Policy. </p>


	<h2>Personal Information provided or collected by us</h2>

	<p>In general you can visit our Websites without providing any personal information. However, if users register to obtain access to some parts of our Websites or Services we may request that you voluntarily supply us with certain personal information. Some of the information requested will be required to use the Websites or Services and some may be optional. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including but not limited to a first and last name, company name, e-mail address, telephone number, physical address, billing information and other such information needed to provide the Services that you request. Personal Information does not include aggregate or non-personally identifiable information. </p>
	<p>TechGenix may collect your personal information in the following ways: (i) when you register to use our Websites and Services (ii) when you sign up to receive our newsletters (iii) when you register for an event or webinar, (iv) when you participate in our surveys or questionnaires (v) when you enter into any promotions, contests or sweepstakes or (vi) when you correspond with us. </p>



	<h2>Non- Personal Information Collected By Us</h2>

	<p>As you navigate through our Websites and Services certain anonymous information may be collected automatically using various technologies such as web server logs, cookies and web beacons as described below. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of users or services that is not personally identifiable. We use this aggregate and other non-personal information to administer, maintain and improve our Websites and Services. This information can be used for internal/external marketing purposes to analyze trends and summarize statistics. It can also provide information about interests and preferences of our users which enables us to target Services that you may find helpful and informative. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Web server logs</em>. When you visit our Websites or use our Services, we may track information related to website usage to administer the Websites and Services and analyze their usage. Examples of information we may collect includes your internet protocol address, what type of browser or computer you use, the number of links you click within the Website, the state or country from which you accessed the Website, the date and time of your visit, the name of your internet services provider, the last page you viewed before visiting our Website, and the pages you viewed on the Website.</li>
		<li><em>Cookies &amp; beacons</em>. If your browser allows it, our Websites and Services use cookies, which are small text files which your computer creates or modifies on instruction of the page opened in your browser. These cookies are used to save your preferences and login information and display personalized content to maximize the performance of our Websites and Services. If you register to use our Services or continue to use our Websites you agree to our use of cookies. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies however, please note that certain features of the Websites or Services may not be available once cookies are disabled.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Furthermore, if your browser allows it, third party cookies may be used for adverts placed on the pages of our Websites. The third-party advertising companies which serve ads when you visit our Websites may use information about your visits to our Websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This information is neither controlled nor used by us and is subject to the privacy policies of the third parties concerned. Specifically, if your browser allows it, where Google adverts are placed on the pages of our Websites, Google will attempt to use one or more cookies called 'DoubleClick DART cookie' to serve ads based on your visit to our Websites and to other sites on the Internet. You can find more information, and opt out of Google advertising cookies, at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a>. </p>
	<p>Furthermore, where third party ads, and specifically Google adverts are placed on the pages of our Websites, a web beacon may be included. A web beacon is a small and unnoticable image served by the third party advertiser in order to collect information from your browser to compile aggregated statistics regarding our Websites and Services. If javascript is not enabled in your browser, or if you use certain ad-blockers, you may not see adverts and therefore you may not be aware that ads are being served. </p>
	<p>Our Websites and Services may contain links to other third party sites that are not owned or controlled by TechGenix. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
