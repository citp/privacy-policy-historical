## VirtoSoftware Privacy Policy

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.

### Information Gathered by VirtoSoftware

For visitors to our website, subscribers to our newsletters, clients and prospective clients of our service (collectively referred to as a "User" or "Users"), we log standard technical information such as your IP address. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our website and in reporting capacities as identified below to companies with whom VirtoSoftware works, including its clients, partners, etc. For example, your IP address may be used to help identify you and your account information and to gather demographic information, or to maintain an aggregated log of click activity on our website.  
Our site uses cookies to keep track of your account. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to you.  
VirtoSoftware requires registration for certain services, such as the trials downloading, and our website may contain order forms for other products and services or online surveys. In order to provide our services to you, we may ask you for contact information (such as name and email address), financial and demographic information (including zip/postal code and age).

###  VirtoSoftware's Use of Information

We may use your contact information to send you information about our company or our advertisers; however, you may opt out of receiving such mailings. We use financial information to bill you for products and services. Demographic, usage and profile data are also collected at our site, and may be used in the course of reporting. Anonymous user data (such as IP addresses, and/or their IP-location information, if available) may be utilized within aggregate traffic reporting to our clients. Additionally, certain information provided at user-registration (such as the name of a media outlet or user title) may be made available to clients within activity reports, although no personally identifiable information (such as names, phone numbers, or email addresses) will be reported.  
We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, to deliver content that we think you might be interested in, to display the content according to your preferences.  
VirtoSoftware may also disclose your personal information, the contents of your communications and/or your contact and financial information if required to do so by law, with your consent or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary:  
1\. To conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on VirtoSoftware;   
2\. To protect and defend the rights or property of VirtoSoftware or others; or   
3\. To assist, under exigent circumstances, in the investigation of securities law violations or other investigations.   
It is possible that as we continue to develop our business, VirtoSoftware might be acquired. In such a transaction, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.
