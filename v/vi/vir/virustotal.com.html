      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
      At VirusTotal, we are keenly aware of the trust users place in us and our
      responsibility to protect the privacy of user information. As part of
      this responsibility, we make public what information we collect when
      someone uses our products and services, why we collect it and how
      we use it to improve user experience and security industry products.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy sets out the privacy practices of Rotarua Limited
      ("Rotarua"), a company incorporated under the laws of Ireland with
      registered number 507502, that owns and develops VirusTotal, including
      the services offered by the Virustotal.com website ("VirusTotal").
    </p>

    <h3>
      Collection and use of submitted files, URLs and personal information
    </h3>

    <p>
      Information we collect to provide you with the services includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The files and URLs you upload for antivirus scanning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Device information: We may collect device-specific information (such as
        your hardware model, operating system version, unique device
        identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number).
      </li>
      <li>
        Log information: When you use our services or view content provided by
        VirusTotal, we may automatically collect and store certain information
        in server logs. This may include: details of how you used our service;
        Internet protocol address; device event information such as crashes,
        system activity, hardware settings, browser type, standard HTTP request
        headers, including but not limited to user agent, referral URL,
        language preference, date and time; and cookies that may uniquely
        identify your browser or your VirusTotal Account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cookies and Local Storage:</strong> We use various technologies
        to collect and store information when you visit the website, and this
        may include sending one or more cookies or randomly generated
        identifiers to your device.  A cookie is a small file containing a
        string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a
        website.  Cookies may store user preferences and other information.
        The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will
        direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,
        how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie,
        or how to fully disable cookies. However, some of VirusTotal’s website
        features or services may not function properly without cookies. We may
        also collect and store information using mechanisms such as browser web
        storage (including HTML5) and application data caches.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How we use information we collect</h3>

    <p>
      We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide,
      maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new services, and to
      protect Virus Total and our users.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you contact VirusTotal, we may keep a record of your communication
      to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email
      address to inform you about our services where you have agreed to this.
      We may also send you administrative messages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Virus Total processes personal information on servers in many countries
      around the world. We may process, transfer and/or store your personal
      information on a server located outside the country where you live. When
      we do so VirusTotal will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure
      that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>

    <h3>Information we share</h3>

    <p>
      When you submit a file to VirusTotal for scanning, we may store it and
      share it with the anti-malware and security industry (normally the
      companies that participate in VirusTotal receive files containing virus
      samples that their engines do not detect and are catalogued as malware by
      at least one other engine). The samples can be analysed by automatic
      tools and security analysts to detect malicious code and to improve
      antivirus engines. Participating anti-malware and security companies will
      adhere to <a href="/en/about/best-practices/">
      VirusTotal's Best Practices</a>
      when using the samples.
    </p>

    <p>
      Files, URLs, comments and any other content submitted to or shared within
      VirusTotal may also be included in premium private services offered by
      VirusTotal to the anti malware and ICT security industry, with the sole
      aim of improving research activities, expecting it to lead to an overall
      safer internet and greater end-user protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, we may also share your information in the following
      circumstances:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>For external processing.</strong> we provide personal
        information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons
        to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with
        our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and
        security measures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For legal reasons.</strong> We will share personal information
        with companies, organisations or individuals outside of VirusTotal if
        we believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the
        information is reasonably necessary to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
            governmental request.
          </li>
          <li>
            enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of
            potential violations.
          </li>
          <li>
            detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
            issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of
            VirusTotal, our users or the public as required or permitted by
            law.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We may share aggregated, anonymised information publicly and with our
      partners – like the anti-malware and security industry. For example,
      we may share information publicly to show statistical trends about the
      general use of our services.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the event that VirusTotal is involved in a merger, acquisition or
      asset sale, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller
      or buyer of such business or assets.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should not share files, URLs, comments or any other content with
      VirusTotal unless you have authority to share it.
    </p>

    <h3>Information security</h3>

    <p>
      Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which
      enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible
      for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a
      password with anyone.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Rights</h3>

    <p>
      We will let you know if we plan to process your personal data for
      marketing purposes when we collect it. You can change your mind at any
      time by contacting us at
      <span class="privacy-email"></span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You also have the right to access information held about you. Your right
      of access can be exercised in accordance with the Data Protection Acts
      1988 and 2003. Any access request may be subject to a statutory fee to
      meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold
      about you.
    </p>

    <h3>Application</h3>

    <p>
      Our website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the
      websites of our partners and members of the VirusTotal Community. If you
      follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites
      have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any
      responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these
      policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
    </p>

    <h3>Enforcement</h3>

    <p>
      We will regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we
      receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made
      the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory
      authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any
      complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot
      resolve with our users directly.
    </p>

    <h3>Changes</h3>

    <p>
      Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be
      posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.
    </p>

    <h3>Contact Us</h3>

    <p>
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to
