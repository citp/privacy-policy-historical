We are totally committed to protecting the privacy of our site visitors and customers and to promoting the responsible consumption of alcohol. We are all customers of other Internet sites and fully appreciate and respect the importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information about our customers to third parties except where it is part of providing a service to you - e.g. arranging for a product to be sent to you, carrying out credit and other security checks and for the purposes of customer research and profiling or where we have your express permission to do so.

If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, please email us at [privacy@virginwines.co.uk](mailto:privacy@virginwines.co.uk) or call 0343 224 1001.

## Site Statistics

We may disclose aggregate, anonymised statistics about the number of visitors to this Website or number of purchases made as required by our investors. We use an independent measurement and research company to gather data regarding the visitors to this Website on our behalf using cookies and code which is embedded in the site. Both the cookies and the embedded code provide statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page view, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors' screen settings and other general information. We use and store this type of information, as with that obtained from other cookies used on the site, to help improve the service to users. Further information regarding the way in which this information is obtained and used can be obtained by contacting us at [privacy@virginwines.co.uk](mailto:privacy@virginwines.co.uk). 

## Protecting your security

We may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information. This is done only to confirm your identity - a credit check is not performed and your credit rating is unaffected.

## Transfers of your Information

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or one of our suppliers. Such processing may, for example, be required in order to fulfil your order, process your payment details or provide support services. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. 

## Disclosures of your information

We may disclose your personal information to any of our group of companies. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties: 

  * in the event that Virgin Wines sells or buys any business or assets; 
  * if Virgin Wines or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data which we hold about our customers may be one of the transferred assets; or 
  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Virgin Wines, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



## Third party sites

Our site may contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and other third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites. 

## Age verification

We are committed to being a responsible supplier of alcohol and encourages a responsible attitude to drinking. We may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate age verification checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to an age verification agency, which may keep a record of that information. This is done only to confirm your age.

## Checking your Details

If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to us you may do so by contacting us via the e-mail address or address given below. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information. This proof of identity will take the form of your e-mail address and password submitted upon registration. You must therefore keep this information safe as you will be responsible for any action which we take in response to a request from someone using your e-mail and password. We would strongly recommend that you do not use the browser's password memory function as that would permit other people using your terminal to access your personal information.
