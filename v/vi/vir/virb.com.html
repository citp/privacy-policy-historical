      <h3>All things concerning our privacy policy</h3>
      
      <p>Welcome to Virb. Virb cares about online privacy and takes the security of your information very seriously. This policy covers the collection and usage of your personal information. Please read it carefully. If you have any questions concerning our privacy policy, send us a message at <a href="http://help.virb.com" title="Virb Help">help.virb.com</a>.</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers the collection and usage of your personal information whenever you visit on Virb.com, or any other website created with Virb (collectively, the "Virb Websites"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "you," "your," and "user" shall refer to any user and/or visitor of any of the Virb Websites. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, your use of any of the Virb Websites, and/or any of the Products and Services offered or provided by Virb, including the addition of new properties, shall be governed by this Privacy Policy and the Virb Terms and Conditions Agreement, where applicable, whether or not you register as a user. Be advised that we may also offer or provide services from time to time that are governed by the privacy policy of the respective service providers, and you agree to be further bound by any rules that are applicable to Virb with respect to the service providers. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, at our sole and absolute discretion.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Information Collection and Use by Virb.</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Virb collects user submitted information such as name and email address to send notifications to those users relating to, without limitation, the Virb service, special events, contests and special offers. As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Virb also logs non-personally identifiable information which includes, without limitation, IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users of the Virb Websites. This data is used to improve the Virb Websites services, to analyze trends, to administer the the Virb Websites, to track user movement around the Virb Websites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Virb will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</li>
              <li>Virb uses pixel tags (tiny graphic images) to tell us what parts of the Virb Websites have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches users perform on the Virb Websites. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format users can read, and they also tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we're only sending email messages that are of interest to our users. Virb stores all of this information in a secure database. </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Use of Cookies.</strong> Like most companies, Virb uses cookies to store user preferences and to record session information for various purposes, including, without limitation, market research to help us determine how best to provide useful information to users and to understand which parts of the Virb Websites and Internet services are of most interest to them, to customize the newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information, to help track usage to help us understand which parts of the Virb Websites are the most popular, where our users are going, and how much time they spend there, to make usage of the Virb Websites even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our communications with users and to customize each user's experience and provide greater convenience. Please rest assured, Virb doesn't link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Virb Websites. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences; however, you must enable cookies from Virb in order to use most functions on the site.</li>
          <li><strong>Sharing / Disclosure.</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>From time to time, Virb or a Virb Partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstakes, or contest on the Virb Websites. In such cases users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address, or to answer questions in order to participate. Virb may transfer such personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.</li>
              <li>Virb does not sell or rent your contact information to marketers. To help us provide superior service, we may share your personal information with third parties who will safeguard it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. There are also times when it may be advantageous for Virb to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Virb has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Virb to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with Virb's policies. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Virb website.</li>
              <li>Virb will not disclose personal information to any third-party unless in accordance with Section 10 of this Privacy Policy.</li>
              <li>Virb reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Virb or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Links to Third-Party Websites.</strong> Virb contains links to third party websites. Virb is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of or on other websites. When linking to another website, a user should read the privacy policy stated on that website. Our privacy policy only governs information collected on the Virb Websites.</li>
          <li><strong>Notice Regarding the Privacy of Children Under 13.</strong> None of the Virb Websites are directed to or recommended for use by children under the age of 13. We operate the Virb Websites in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age.</li>
          <li><strong>Tracking User Activity.</strong> Virb may send email messages which use or otherwise contain a "click-through URL" that is linked to content on the Virb Websites. When the "click-through URL" is clicked on or otherwise activated, the party who clicked on or otherwise activated the "click-through URL" is taken through the Virb web server(s) before arriving at the destination page. During this process, "click-through data" is collected by Virb, which may include, without limitation, data that helps us determine interest in particular topics and data that helps us measure the effectiveness of the communications we send out. If you prefer not to be tracked in this manner, simply avoid clicking on or otherwise activating text or graphic links in the email.</li>
          <li><strong>Concerning Content you Add to Virb.</strong> Any content that you add, upload, post, publish, or otherwise disseminate through the Products and Services offered by Virb should be considered fully accessible by the public and not private. Such content, once published, may immediately become accessible on search engines and other sites. It is important that you are mindful of this fact.</li>
          <li><strong>Concerning Content you Add to Virb.</strong> Any content that you add, upload, post, publish, or otherwise disseminate through the Products and Services offered by Virb should be considered fully accessible by the public and not private. Such content, once published, may immediately become accessible on search engines and other sites. It is important that you are mindful of this fact.</li>
          <li><strong>Email Preferences / Opting-Out.</strong> Occasionally, Virb may send email regarding news, promotions, surveys , updates, or offers related to Virb. Users who no longer wish to receive these emails may choose not to by simply opting-out. To opt-out, simply click on the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email. It is important to note, users cannot opt-out of email regarding legal notices or user account changes.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance with Law.</strong> Virb may preserve any Content contained on or about its web server(s) and may also disclose such Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith that preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with a search warrant or other legal process received by Virb; (b) enforce the Terms and Conditions; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Virb, its users and the public.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Transmission.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that the technical processing and transmission of the Products and Services, including any of your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to the technical requirements of connecting the networks or devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Security.</strong> Virb Accounts are secured by user-created (as applicable) passwords. Virb takes precautions to ensure that account information is kept private through reasonable measures such as encryption to protect private information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to such private information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note, however, that Virb cannot and does not guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user account information at any time. Users are urged to take precautions to protect their personal data by changing passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers, and using a secure web browser. For any additional information about the security measures Virb uses on the Virb Websites, please contact us at
