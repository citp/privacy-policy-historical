We use service providers in connection with the operation of our Website to ensure we deliver the best possible services. We enter into contracts with our service providers and ensure they take good care of your Personal Data we share with them for that purpose.

As a gambling operator, we are subject to strict legal and regulatory obligations to ensure you can use our Website. Because of this, we will share your Personal Data with third party service providers (such as credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies, payment service providers, banks, financial institutions and similar third parties) for checking your identity, monitoring your behaviour on our Website, combatting money laundering, protecting our Website against any illegal use and any other activity we consider necessary to meet our obligations.

We enter into contracts with these service providers to comply with our legal and regulatory duties. In addition, these specific kinds of service providers are also “data controllers” under data protection laws as they own their own databases that may include personal information about you. Because of that, when we share your details with them, your Personal Data and privacy rights are protected as these service providers are also subject to data protection laws.

When you set up your Member Account with us, we will proceed to verify your identity and age as required by the Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice to which we are subject as a gambling operator. If we are unable to verify these details, we may proceed to manual verifications to comply with our obligations. In that case, we may contact you and ask you to supply further proof of your identity and we cannot give you access to our Website until you prove your identity to us. We have 72 hours from the registration of your Member Account on our Website to carry out these manual verifications. 

We will share your Personal Data when it is required by applicable law in the following cases:

  * To comply with a request for information from a governmental body such as law enforcement (police) or other public authorities (e.g., Insolvency Service);
  * To comply with a court order to disclose your Personal Data; and/or
  * To comply with a regulatory investigation from a relevant gambling authority (e.g. the Gambling Commission in the UK or the Gibraltar Gambling Commission or a relevant data protection authority (e.g. the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK).



We may transfer all your Personal Information to a third party if the operator of the Website changes, or if there is a sale of all or any part of its business or its assets. In the event of any of these transfers occurring, the party who acquires the data will assume the rights and obligations described in this Privacy Policy.

**What we do to keep your Personal Data safe:**

We have appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Where appropriate, we employ encryption, pseudonymisation (for example, by using your member ID rather than full name where appropriate) and anonymisation solutions to reduce the impact of any security incident to Personal Data. Although, the nature of the internet means that transmission of information may not be totally secured, we have deployed end to end encryption security measures to protect the transmission of your Personal Data when you use our Website.

In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

**Managing security incidents relating to Personal Data:**

We have procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

If you have any reason to believe that your Member Account information may no longer be safe, please contact our customer support staff [here](https://virgingames.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_launch).

**Keeping your member account safe:**

When you create an account with us, we ask you to choose a password and personal question to retrieve access to your member account. We use password protection to ensure your member account is safe at all times and can only be accessed by you. You must keep your username, password and personal question details private and confidential at all times. Please choose a password that is strong and not easy to guess. Please do not share your password with anyone and please change it on a regular basis. If you suspect your password has been disclosed to anyone, please change it immediately to ensure your Member Account remains safe.

We primarily store and process our Member Account data within the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”).

However, in the following cases we can transfer your Personal Data outside the EEA: 

  * If we have a legal or regulatory reason to do so;
  * If we use third parties service providers located outside of the EEA; or
  * If you have consented to this transfer.



**Third parties service providers**

To operate our Website, we may use third party service providers which are based outside the EEA, so their processing of your Personal Data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your Personal Data to a service provider outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries where the European Commission considers they provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data. For further details on this safeguard, see European Commission: [Adequacy of the protection of Personal Information in non-EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en).
  * We may contract with the service provider on terms that are approved by the European Commission to aim to give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details on this safeguard, see European Commission: [Model contracts for the transfer of Personal Information to third countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en).
  * Where we use service providers based in the United States of America, we may transfer data to them if they are part of what is known as the "Privacy Shield". This Privacy Shield requires them to provide similar levels of protection to Personal Data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details on this safeguard, see European Commission:[ EU-US Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).



If you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data outside of the EEA, please contact our DPO (see section 2 of this Privacy Policy).

We will not keep your Personal Data for longer than required. The precise duration for which we keep your Personal Data when you have a live member account with us or for a period after your cease to be a member with us, can vary and depends on various reasons. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and what the law requires us to do. For example, we retain a copy of your Member Account’s records of all financial and wagering transactions together with any identification provided for as long as is necessary for the relevant service and for no longer than 7 years after you have closed your Member Account.

When we no longer need to keep your Personal Data, we anonymise it securely and this process cannot be reversed. In certain cases, we need to securely retain certain Personal Data to fulfil our legal and regulatory obligations (including anti-money laundering requirements, responsible gaming requirements and the requirements of the Gambling Commission in the UK and the Gibraltar Gambling Commission to which we are subject as a gambling operator.

Additionally, where we decide to retain your information for analytics purposes, we will fully anonymise it in accordance with applicable security standards, so it can never be linked back to an individual.

Please note that if you decide to opt-out from receiving marketing communications from us (see section 6 above), we will need to retain a copy of your contact details, so we can add them to our suppression list and make sure you do not receive any information about our future marketing activities.

Please contact the DPO (see section 2 above) if you need any further information. 

The law gives you legal rights in respect of the Personal Data we hold about you. You can exercise your legal rights for free except where this Privacy Policy states otherwise. We may need to request specific Personal Data from you from time to time to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that your Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month of receipt. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Below is a summary of the legal rights you have, what we do to protect them and how you can exercise them: 

**Your rights** | **What we do to protect your rights** | **How to exercise your rights**
