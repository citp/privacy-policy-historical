That's fine. Forward the email you have received with the subject line “unsubscribe” to us at [privacy@virginmoney.com.au](mailto:privacy@virginmoney.com.au) or call us on [+61 2 8222 8000](tel:0282228000).

  * How do we collect personal information?

We will ordinarily collect any information about you directly from you or where it is provided to us with your authority.  For example, we collect personal information directly from you through forms you fill out when applying for our products and services, when you make a claim under an insurance policy or through your ongoing interaction with us. 

When you call us on the telephone, we may monitor and in some cases record the telephone conversation for staff training and record-keeping purposes.  Further, when we communicate with you by email, we may use technology to identify you so that we will be in a position to know when you have opened the email or clicked on a link in the email.

From time to time we may receive information that we have not asked for about you from third parties. We will only keep, use and disclose this information as permitted by law.

Further, if personal information about you is collected by third parties on any website you have accessed through our websites, we may also collect or have access to that information as part of our arrangement with those third parties.

We may also collect basic personal information about third parties (e.g. an employer or a health provider) if provided by an applicant or claimant.

  * Online links to Third Party and Co-Branded sites?

Virgin Money may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to our website to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with our logo; however, these sites may not be operated or maintained by or on our behalf. These sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with us. This Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner. 

Despite this, we are not responsible for the content or practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to our website. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by us of the content, policies or practices of those third party sites.

    * on secure servers;

    * in telephone recordings;
    * in paper files; and
    * document retention services off-site.

This may include storage on our behalf by third party service providers. See our comments below about how we protect your information.

  * Why do we exchange personal information with third parties?

We may sometimes exchange your personal information with other companies to deliver our products or services to you which may include marketing our own products. 

The types of organisations to which we may disclose this information include other financial services companies that we partner with to provide our products and services, regulatory bodies and government agencies, courts and external dispute resolution schemes, your agents, including brokers or financial advisers, our agents, contractors and professional advisers who assist us in providing our services, your referees and guarantors, your or our insurers, and organisations that carry out functions on our behalf including mailing houses, data processors, researchers, system developers or testers, accountants, auditors and lawyers.. While we share your information with them, these partners are not able to disclose it to others or use it for purposes other than the delivery of Virgin Money products and services unless you have provided consent.

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties where you request us to or consent to us doing so or in order to fulfill our legal obligations. The information we provide to other organisations will be limited to what is required to provide the service or comply with the law. We don't give your personal information to other companies for any other purposes not mentioned above. e.g. marketing non Virgin Money products and services.

  * Exchange of information within the group

  * Access and correction to your personal information

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

You may request access to the information we hold about you at any time by calling our Privacy Officer on [+61 2 8222 8000](tel:61282228000) or emailing us at [privacy@virginmoney.com.au](mailto:privacy@virginmoney.com.au).

Under certain circumstances, we may not tell you what personal information we hold about you or allow you to access that information, for example where the information relates to legal proceedings with you or where we are prevented by law from disclosing the information, or providing access would prejudice certain investigations. If one of the exceptions applies, we will consider whether the use of an intermediary is appropriate and would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties. Where we do grant access to your information, we may charge you a fee for accessing your personal information.

Under the Privacy Act, you also have a right to request that we correct information that you believe to be inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. If at any time you believe that personal information that we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, please advise us by calling our Privacy Officer on [+61 2 8222 8000](tel:61282228000) or emailing us at [privacy@virginmoney.com.au](mailto:privacy@virginmoney.com.au) and we will take all reasonable steps to correct the information. You can ask us to associate with the information held, a statement from you claiming that the information is not correct.

If there is a denial of access to your personal information or a dispute as to the correctness of any personal information held, we will provide you with reasons for the denial or its refusal to correct the personal information. If you disagree with our decision for the denial or refusal to correct the personal information, you may request that we review the decision via our complaints handling procedures which are outlined below.

  * Dealing with us anonymously or using a fake name

We will generally need to know who you are in order to provide you with our products and services. 

Despite this, in some circumstances you are entitled to deal with us anonymously, or by using a pseudonym (fake name), for example when making general enquiries about the services we offer

In some circumstances, you may receive a better service or response if we know who you are.  For example, we can keep you up-to-date and better understand a complaint you might have if we know who you are and the circumstances of your complaint.

You must tell us when you are using a pseudonym when applying for our services. If we need to identify you, we will tell you whether or not your real name is required to access those services.

  * What happens if our Privacy Policy changes in future?

This statement sets out our current Privacy Policy. It replaces any of our other Privacy Policies which have been issued before the date of this Privacy Policy.

We listen to the feedback our customers give us, and also what the broader public has to say about what we do. This informs how we develop new products and services, and also new ways of working. Because of this, our Privacy Policy may need to change from time to time. If it does, we'll notify you by publishing the new version on our website at [virginmoney.com.au](https://web.archive.org/).

We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy for any changes.
