Additionally, We may use Anonymous Data to analyze and understand demographic trends, customer behavior patterns and preferences, and information that can help Us enrich the content and quality of the Virgin Pulse Program.

**How does Virgin Pulse communicate with me?**

If you have opted to receive push notifications on your mobile device, We may, from time to time, send you push notifications to provide you with reminders and notices. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level.

From time to time, We may send you e-mails or newsletters with information about your Program and the Virgin Pulse platform and services. Depending on your country of residence, you may be given the opportunity to opt-in to receive these communications as you enroll in the platform. Regardless of your initial selection, you may opt-out of these communications, free of charge, at any time during your Membership, by updating your preferences in your account profile information, or by contacting Us directly.

**Can Virgin Pulse contact me directly?**

You may share your phone number with us or We may receive it from your Program Sponsor or third party. If you are a US resident, by accepting this Agreement, you expressly consent and give your permission for Us to contact you directly, including, but not limited to, via phone, the use of an Automated Telephone Dialing System, prerecorded and/or artificial voice, SMS, MMS, text, fax or other similar means, at any phone number whether such information is provided by you, your Program Sponsor or another third party.

**How does Virgin Pulse collect my Personal Information?**

We collect Personal Information you voluntarily provide as you submit it through the web-based platform and the mobile application, by reviewing your use of the web-based platform and mobile application (for example through the completion of a health assessment), your use of a synched tracking device such as a MAX or MAX BUZZ and when you participate in our phone or on-site services and events. Depending on the Program design chosen by your Program Sponsor, We may collect Personal Information through your use of additional services such as the Virgin Pulse Activity Tracking Devices and the Health Stations (additional information on these is provided below). Virgin Pulse may also collect information about you and your participation in the Program through engagement surveys. Depending on your Program design, your Program Sponsor may have the opportunity to create surveys (the “Virgin Pulse Surveys”) for its Members to complete.

We may also automatically collect additional information when you visit Our web-based platform or mobile application, including the type of browser used, the internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, the files viewed on Our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), date and time stamps of activity on the platform, the accessing IP address (the unique address that identifies your device on the internet) and the operating system your device uses. We use this additional information to derive a broad, non-specific understanding of the locations from which Our Members access Our services, and to enhance the security controls around platform access. We also use it to analyze trends, administer the web-based platform, track Members’ movements on the platform and around the website, and to gather demographic information about Our Member base as a whole.

**What information do Virgin Pulse Surveys collect from me?**

Depending on your Program design, your Program Sponsor may be able to create and submit customized Virgin Pulse Surveys for its Members to complete. Virgin Pulse does not contribute to the creation of the questions in these surveys and does not review the questions in these surveys. If you decide to take part in a Virgin Pulse Survey the results will be shared with your Program Sponsor in aggregated reports. Your Program Sponsor will not be able to identify you from these reports. However, if the survey offered gives you the ability to respond to a question by writing in a response, the response will be shared with the Program Sponsor. If you include identifiable Personal Information in these open-ended responses, your Program Sponsor may be able to identify you.

** ** **What information does Virgin Pulse collect through the health assessment?**

Depending on your Program design, you may have access to a health assessment questionnaire. Health assessments can be customized by Program Sponsors and may be used to assess your overall health, your lifestyle across multiple areas of wellbeing or both. You do not have to complete the health assessment if you do not want to share this type of information with Us.

** ** **What are the activity tracking devices and how do they track my activity?**

As a Program Member you will be able to connect activity trackers to your account. If you choose to synchronize an activity tracker with the Program, We will receive limited information about your activity to populate your account. Activity tracking devices can track a wide number of different aspects of your daily activities, including, among others, your daily steps and fitness activity, your heartbeat and sleep pattern. Depending on the brand and model of activity tracker you use, the data collected may vary. In general, companies selling activity tracking devices have specific privacy policies available, which outline what data the specific activity tracking device collects. We strongly suggest you review the right privacy notice to know what specific data points your activity tracking device collects about you.

The Virgin Pulse activity tracking devices are the MAX and the MAX BUZZ. These devices track your step activity per minute. From this information, Virgin Pulse is able to determine your total active fitness minutes and calories consumed. Additionally, if you wear the MAX BUZZ to sleep, it can recognize the length of your sleep from how long you lie still.

**What are Health Stations and what information can I submit by using them?**

Depending on the type of Program made available to you by your Program Sponsor, you may have access to Health Stations. Health Stations are measurement tracking stations that allow you to measure your blood pressure and weight and input that information in the Program. Health Stations may be located, for example, in your office. Depending on your Program, you may receive access to Health Stations in your area at no additional cost.

** ** **Does Virgin Pulse receive information about me from other sources?**

Yes. We may receive information about you from various sources to support the Program and services included in it. The sources may include:

_Your Program Sponsor_  
Your Program Sponsor may provide us your Personal Information to identify you as an individual who is able to join the Program and become a Member. We call this an “Eligibility File”.
