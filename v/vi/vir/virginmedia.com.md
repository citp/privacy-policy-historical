# Privacy Policy | Virgin Media

At Virgin Media, we take the safeguarding of your information very seriously. One of the ways we do this is by adhering to the requirements of UK data protection legislation, and this has changed as part of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR for short) in force from 2018.

This means we’ve made some changes to our [privacy policy](https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/the-legal-stuff/privacy-policy.html), and we want to make sure you understand what these changes mean for you.

Before we get started, here’s a few things to keep in mind. When we talk about ‘you’ or ‘your’ we mean the person who is the account holder and has a contract with Virgin Media Limited or Virgin Mobile Telecoms Limited or Virgin Media Mobile Finance Limited.

Where we talk about Virgin Media we mean these three companies that provide our products and services that include broadband, TV, landline and mobile services and/or products.

Virgin Media will be the Controller of the information that you provide to us, and that we collect about you when you use our online services (<https://www.virginmedia.com/> website and MyVM account). We’ll also collect information when we provide you with, or answer questions about, our products and services, including broadband, TV, landline, mobile. Our [contact details](https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/the-legal-stuff/privacy-policy.html#getintouch) are set out below.

This [Privacy Policy](https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/the-legal-stuff/privacy-policy.html) gives you detailed information on when and why we collect your information, how we use it, and how we keep it secure.  Please take a moment to read it so you know what choices and rights you have about the information we may ask you for or collect about you. This policy may change from time to time so it's a good idea to come back and read through it every now and then. If there’s a significant change to the policy, we’ll let you know straight away. So, let’s get into it.

We’ll continue to exchange information about you with credit reference agencies on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time.  Credit reference agencies will share your information with other organisations.  Your data will also be linked to the data of your spouse, any joint applicants or other financial associates.

  * Fraud Prevention Agencies
  * Market Researchers
  * Public Information sources such as the electoral roll.



####  Why do you collect my information? __ Why do you collect my information? __

There are a few ways we use the information we hold about you. We’ll use it:

**Where it’s necessary to perform our contract with you**

o   To occasionally carry out market research

o   To administer contests and competitions

Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you’ve got the right to withdraw your consent at any time.  You can do this by:

  * Accessing Marketing Preferences page on your My Virgin Media account, or contacting us

**Where we’ve got a legitimate interest –** which is where we’ve got a good reason to process your data; e.g. situations where Virgin Media needs to process information to operate its business. However we always do this by considering the safeguards and impact to you. Processing activities based on a legitimate interest are:

o   To provide you with service information and updates in relation to the products and services you’ve ordered from us ****

We’ll not, however, use information about your use of third party applications on our TV service to personalise or tailor advertising

o   To provide you with tailored advertising, features and content.  We use the information we hold about you to tailor the adverts, content and features you receive to make them more relevant.

If you don’t wish to received tailored advertising as part of your TiVo service you can switch this off at any time on your set top box by accessing the Help menu and selecting the option to opt out of tailored advertising

**Where we’ve got a legal obligation to process personal information:**

Virgin Media is required to capture, retain and share some personal data for legal reasons such as:

  * Where there’s a need to block unauthorised or illegitimate content

  * To help authorities with any security, crime or anti-terrorism enquiries
  * To demonstrate compliance with anti-money laundering rules
  * To ensure monitor any other regulatory requirements linked with treating customers fairly and processing records properly.

o   For the purposes of fraud prevention and screening preventing nuisance calls

o   We may use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring usage of our services in order to help us develop our services, and may provide such aggregate information to third parties, for example, content partners and advertisers. These statistics do not include information that can be used to identify any individual

o   To the marketing agencies we work with when creating marketing campaigns, special offers and promotions targeted for you. We may share your information with our partner companies who provide you with customer service on our behalf or help deliver/provide the product or service you have chosen

o   Our service providers in order for us to provide our services to you, for example if you use the Voice Search functionality on your Virgin TV Go application we may share your audio files with our provider in the United States for storage and processing

o   We may share your information to comply with legal and regulatory obligations to protect or enforce our rights or that of a third party such as analysing activity on our network to help block unauthorised or illegal content access or publication; for the purpose of protecting vital interests, national security, statutory obligations or responding to requests from courts and enforcement authorities

We only share your data with other controllers if this is directly requested by you, for example for your number porting to a different service provider.

We won’t pass on your personal information to third parties except in accordance with this policy and our Terms and Conditions or where we are required to disclose that information in order to comply with any legal or regulatory requirements.

####  How do you protect my information? __ How do you protect my information? __

The security of your information is really important to us. Any information sent to us is protected using robust security methods. The methods we use are industry-standard ensuring data is safeguarded whilst being sent over unprotected communications paths such as the internet. When it reaches us, we store it securely and only provide access to it by those authorised. Although we safeguard your personal information once received, Virgin Media cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information you transmit to us using online methods.

Our security measures include:

o   Encryption of data where appropriate

We’ll never ask you for your Virgin Media identification, on-line passwords or PIN numbers directly associated with your Virgin Media account in any unsolicited phone calls or unsolicited emails. In accordance with our Terms and Conditions, you’re responsible for keeping your password and PIN secure and we very strongly recommend you do not disclose them to anyone (unless you wish to authorise them to access your account and potentially incur charges on your account).

####  How do you keep my information? __ How do you keep my information? __

We collect and store your data safely and only for the time strictly necessary to operate services provided to you by Virgin Media and/or based on the reasons that we process your personal data.  Afterwards it’ll either be destroyed or anonymised.

  * Legal obligation(s) requiring data to be kept for certain periods of time
  * (Potential) disputes
  * Guidelines issued by the UK’s data protection authority.



A few examples for how long we’ll keep your data:

o   In the case of VOD viewing data, we collect and store your TV data for 4 weeks after viewing, after which is deleted or anonymised.

4.      The right to erasure

This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.  
  
5.      The right to restrict processing

| 

You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further.

You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. e.g. if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your relevant information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability, such as your name and address.

We use technology to make decisions automatically or to build profiles about you. This technology uses logic that analyses your preferences and how you use our products and services, which helps us to improve your customer experience, making it more relevant for you and allowing you to get the most out of our products and services.  What this means for you is that you will regularly receive from us personalised content (offers, promotions, TV programmes recommendations etc.).

We also use technology to make decisions automatically based on your credit score analysis, which allows us to guarantee your regular payments for our products and services. What this means for you is that we’ll decide your eligibility for our products and services based on your credit history.  
  
To exercise any of these rights at any time, check out the Contact Us section.

####  How do you market your products and services? __ How do you market your products and services? __
