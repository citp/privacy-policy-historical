If we cannot pass this information to the relevant suppliers, whether in the EEA or not, we cannot provide your booking.

Virgin Travel Group may collate and link together the personal information that is has collected from you with any information that it has collected about you from any other sources.

### Information Sharing

In order to process your booking and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet your requirements. We must pass the information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as airlines, hotels, transport companies etc. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public authorities such as customs/immigration if required by them, or as required by law. Additionally, where your holiday is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), controls on data protection in your destination may not be as strong as the legal requirements in this country.

Many airlines are now required by law to give US Customs and other border control agencies access to certain passenger information. Accordingly, any such Advance Passenger Information - including sensitive personal information - that the Virgin Travel Group holds about you and your travel arrangements may be disclosed to those agencies in the countries to which you are travelling. You understand and accept that if your information is disclosed to third parties outside the European Economic Area (the European Union plus, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), those third parties may reside in territories which may not have suitable data protection provisions in place, but every effort will be made to ensure that your information is processed only for the purpose set out above, and for no other purposes.

Certain travel and reservation information may also be transferred between the European Union and the United States in order to help US authorities prevent and combat terrorism and other serious transnational crimes.   
 

Your information (including sensitive personal data) may be processed by a third party that we have engaged to carry out work on our behalf, called a data processor. Our data processors are carefully selected and screened to ensure the protection of your security and privacy and they are only permitted to use the information in accordance with our instructions.

We may also share your information with companies in the Virgin group for business purposes.

The Virgin Travel Group may also process and share your personal information with any relevant third party for the prevention and detection and investigation of crime.  Virgin Holidays may share your personal information with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, with the Virgin Travel Group and with other companies within the Virgin Group for the use in credit decisions, credit risk reduction, fraud detection and prevention and for the prevention and detection of any form of security risk or crime.

Your information may be disclosed to any successors of our business, in the event of a re-organisation, merger or sale, for them to use for the purposes as set out in this Privacy policy.

### Direct Marketing Material

Your personal information may be used by us and the Virgin Travel Group to contact you by post, phone (including via an automated dialling system), e-mail or electronic messaging services with information about products and services (including discounts and special offers) we think will be of interest to you. We may also use your information to keep you up to date about special offers and promotions via social media.

We may also send you such information about other companies' products and services (such as other members of the Virgin Travel Group, other Virgin companies or our partners / suppliers), that may be of interest to you.

By making a Virgin Atlantic Flight+Hotel, Hotel or Car Hire enquiry or booking on  [https://travelplus.virginatlantic.com](https://travelplus.virginatlantic.com/) website you agree that Virgin Holidays may pass your personal information to Virgin Atlantic Airways to administer the relevant services to you, carry out statistical analysis, market research and to enable them to contact you about future Flight+Hotel and Virgin Atlantic products and offers.
