# Privacy - Virgin Holidays

## Data Protection

_‘We’ are Virgin Holidays, a member of the Virgin Holidays Family, which includes Virgin Holidays, Virgin Holidays Cruises, Virgin Holidays & Worldwide Journeys, Virgin Holidays & HIP Hotels, Travel City Direct and Bales Worldwide._

In order to process your booking and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet your requirements we need to use the information you provide such as name, address, any special needs/dietary requirements etc. We take full responsibility for ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect your information. We must pass the information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as airlines, hotels, transport companies etc. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public authorities such as customs/immigration if required by them, or as required by law. Additionally, where your holiday is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), controls on data protection in your destination may not be as strong as the legal requirements in this country.

We may use your information for the purposes set out in our data protection notification with the Office of the Information Commissioner. We may disclose the same to companies in the Virgin group for business purposes and to companies who act as data processors on our behalf. Some of your information may be 'sensitive personal data' such as details of any disabilities, or dietary/religious requirements. (If we cannot pass this information to the relevant suppliers, whether in the EEA or not, we cannot provide your booking). In making this booking, you consent to this information being passed on to the relevant persons. You are responsible for ensuring that other members of your party are aware of our privacy policy.

Telephone calls made to and from our Contact Centres may be recorded and monitored for the purpose of quality assurance, training, security and for business purposes.

**Direct Marketing Material**

We would like to hold your information (including any email address), where collected by us, for our own future marketing purposes (for example to inform you of promotional/competition offers, to help recognise and service a potential booking on our website or to send you our brochure). 

If you have given us, the Virgin Holidays Group, your consent, from time to time we may contact you by post, phone, e-mail or electronic messaging services with information about products and services (including discounts and special offers) we think will be of interest to you. We may also use your email address to keep you up to date about special offers and promotions via social media.

We may also send you such information about other companies' products and services (such as other members of the Virgin Holidays Family or other Virgin companies), that may be of interest to you. We may disclose your information to third parties, like data processing companies, who may provide marketing services on our behalf. You will not be directly contacted by third parties as a result of giving us your details.

We will endeavour to update your record as soon as we possibly can. Of course, if you tell us that you do not wish to receive marketing, you may still receive transactional and service based communications confirming and servicing any bookings you make with us. 

Where we do collect your personal information, it is stored in our secure databases at a secure address to prevent unauthorised access.
