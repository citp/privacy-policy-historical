12.1     **Our security measures**

We strive to constantly keep our security practices under review to make sure that we’re keeping your information as safe as possible. We use a variety of different technical and operational security measures to protect your information against unauthorised access or unlawful use. For example we:

  * Ensure the physical security of our offices, warehouses and other sites;  
 
  * Ensure the physical and digital security of our equipment, devices and systems by mandating appropriate password protection, encryption and access restrictions;  
 
  * Are a “PCI DSS” compliant company, meaning that we apply certain high standards of security in respect of your payment information;  
 
  * Ensure appropriate access controls so that access to your information is only granted to those of our people that need to use it in the course of their work;  
 
  * Carry out regular penetration testing of our systems and third party reviews of our software; and  
 
  * Maintain internal policies and deliver data protection and confidentiality training to make sure our people also understand their responsibilities in looking after your information and commit to taking appropriate measures to enforce these responsibilities. 



12.2     **How you can help ensure the security of your information  **

You can also play a part in helping to keep your information safe. Here are a few useful starting points:

  * Choose strong passwords and change them regularly;  
 
  * Keep your booking references and passwords confidential, and avoid sharing them with anyone else or using your password for multiple accounts;  
 
  * Log out of “Manage my booking” after each session if you are using a shared computer;

Be sure to consult the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of the relevant third party site to understand how that site collects and uses your information and to establish whether and for what purposes they use cookies.   
 

13.     **HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR**

We keep your information for as long as is reasonably necessary to enable us to provide you with the services that you have requested from us, to comply with any legal obligations that require us to keep information, or for as long as we reasonably require for our legitimate interests, including for example for the purposes of exercising our legal rights or defending ourselves against claims. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold and the length of time that we need to keep it. For example:

  * We try to adopt a paperless approach wherever possible and securely destroy any paper correspondence we receive on a regular basis unless we are required to retain it for evidential or legal purposes;

  * We retain a suppression list of individuals who no longer wish to be contacted by us indefinitely. We need to keep this information to comply with their wishes not to contact them;

  * We retain any unsuccessful CV’s or job applications that we receive for a period of up to 2 years in case we think you might be suited to another opportunity that becomes available in the near future.
