This Privacy Policy briefly tells you how we manage the personal information that we collect, use, hold and disclose and how to contact us if you have any queries. This Privacy Policy does not cover personal information collected or held by us about our employees and is to be read subject to any overriding provisions of law or contract. There are special terms in this privacy policy that will apply to you if you link from one of our websites to a website operated by another person (such as a social media website), using an icon displayed on our websites.

We comply with the applicable privacy laws and we are committed to take all reasonably available measures to protect your privacy.

By visiting our website and/or providing personal information to us and/or by clicking a link to a another person's website, you consent to the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy unless you tell us to the contrary by following the instructions contained on our website or by contacting our [Privacy Officer](http://www.virginaustralia.com/about-us/legal-policies/privacy/#privacy_officer) or our [Guest Contact Centre](http://www.virginaustralia.com/help/contact-us/).

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires you to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560. You may also provide your Redress Number, if available. Failure to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender may result in denial of transport or denial of authority to enter the boarding area.

## 1\. Background

Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion.

Other than in the United States, sensitive information encompasses health information and information about a person's race, ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences and criminal history. Sensitive information may only be collected if you consent to it or when required by law. We will assume that, unless you tell us otherwise, you have consented to the collection of the information that you have provided to us for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy which may vary from time to time.

In this policy, we refer collectively to personal information and sensitive information as personal information.

We only collect the personal information we reasonably require, in the course of our business of providing services, in accordance with this Privacy Policy by lawful, fair and non intrusive means.

## 2\. Personal information collected in the United States

In the United States, personal information might include your name, mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, and other identification and contact information. We may also collect certain financial information; whenever we do so, we will attempt to provide a link to this Policy so that you can confirm how this information will be used. With this information, we can fill your service and product orders and better provide you with personalized services. Personal information is not information that does not identify a specific individual by itself or in combination with other information. We may gather certain information about you such as age, date of birth, gender, as well as consumer purchasing information based upon where you shop on any one of our websites. This information may be compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the Internet. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the Internet. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

## 3\. Collection of Personal Information by Us

In addition to our need to collect personal information to provide services, we are also required to collect personal information under the laws pertaining to civil aviation and air travel.

The kinds of personal information we collect and store will depend on what products and services you request from us. However, it may include (amongst other things):

  * Personal information you give us when you request a product or service from us. This information may include your intended travel dates, place of departure, intended destination and whether you are an adult or a child;
  * Personal information you give us when you make a flight booking. This information may include your name, address, telephone numbers, email address, credit card details, passport details and Velocity Rewards membership number;
  * Communications between you and us;
  * Transactional information about your use of our products and services (for example your feedback on how you enjoyed your flight with us); and
  * If you are applying for a position, we will collect information as outlined in the section below titled "Employment Applications".



## 4\. Where Your Personal Information is Stored

Where we store your personal information depends on what products and services you have requested from us. However, some areas may include (amongst other things):

  * Our booking system for use of processing transactions, providing confirmation of flights, being aware of any special travel requirements (health or otherwise) and confirming identity;
  * Feedback databases for processing customer feedback; and
  * Email databases for V-Mail and The Lounge subscriptions.

For special terms that apply if you link from one of our websites to a website operated by another person, using an icon displayed on our websites, check the section entitled Special terms for links to third party websites.

## 5\. How Your Personal Information is Stored

We take reasonable steps to preserve your personal information from loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure in accordance with the Virgin Australia Web Site Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.

We regularly review developments in security and encryption technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Accordingly, although we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information in our own systems.

If a substantial data breach has or may have occurred (i.e. your personal information was shared with unauthorised entities), we will promptly notify you and the Privacy Commissioner about that actual or possible breach.

We only keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected or as otherwise required by law. We take appropriate measures to destroy or permanently de-identify your personal information when we no longer need to retain it. These measures may vary depending on the type of personal information concerned, the way it was collected and how it is stored.

For special terms that apply if you link from one of our websites to a website operated by another person, using an icon displayed on our websites, check the section entitled Special terms for links to third party websites.

  * You have consented to the use or disclosure of your personal information for the secondary purpose; or
  * The use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or
  * The use or disclosure is otherwise permitted by law (for example, as a necessary part of an investigation of suspected unlawful activity).
