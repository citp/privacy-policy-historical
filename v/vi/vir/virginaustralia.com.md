This Privacy Policy briefly tells you how we manage the personal information that we collect, use, hold and disclose and how to contact us if you have any queries. This Privacy Policy does not cover personal information collected or held by us about our employees and is to be read subject to any overriding provisions of law or contract.

We comply with the applicable privacy laws and we are committed to take all reasonably available measures to protect your privacy.

By visiting our website and/or providing personal information to us, you consent to the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy unless you tell us to the contrary by following the instructions contained on our website or by contacting our Privacy Officer or our Guest Contact Centre.

#### Background

Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion. 

Sensitive information encompasses health information and information about a person's race, ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences and criminal history. Sensitive information may only be collected if you consent to it or when required by law. We will assume that, unless you tell us otherwise, you have consented to the collection of the information that you have provided to us for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy which may vary from time to time.

In this policy, we refer collectively to personal information and sensitive information as personal information.

We only collect the personal information we reasonably require, in the course of our business of providing services, in accordance with this Privacy Policy by lawful, fair and non intrusive means.

#### Collection of personal information by us

In addition to our need to collect personal information to provide services, we are also required to collect personal information under the laws pertaining to civil aviation and air travel.

The kinds of personal information we collect and store will depend on what products and services you request from us. However, it may include (amongst other things):

  * personal information you give us when you request a product or service from us. This information may include your intended travel dates, place of departure, intended destination and whether you are an adult or a child;
  * personal information you give us when you make a flight booking. This information may include your name, address, telephone numbers, email address, credit card details, passport details and Velocity Frequent Flyer membership number;
  * communications between you and us;
  * transactional information about your use of our products and services (for example your feedback on how you enjoyed your flight with us); and
  * if you are applying for a position, we will collect information as outlined in the section below titled "Employment Applications".  




#### Where your personal information is stored                                                                                   


Where we store your personal information depends on what products and services you have requested from us. However, some areas may include (amongst other things): 

  * Our booking system for use of processing transactions, providing confirmation of flights, being aware of any special travel requirements (health or otherwise) and confirming identity
  * Feedback databases for processing customer feedback
  * Email databases for V-Mail and Virgin Australia lounge subscriptions



For further information on how we use your information, check [Use and disclosure of personal information by us](https://web.archive.org/web/20111201150904id_/http%3A//www.virginaustralia.com/Privacy/index.htm#useanddisclosure)

#### How your personal information is stored    

We take reasonable steps to preserve your personal information from loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure in accordance with the Virgin Australia Web Site Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. 

We regularly review developments in security and encryption technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Accordingly, although we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information in our own systems.

If a substantial data breach has or may have occurred (i.e. your personal information was shared with unauthorised entities), we will promptly notify you and the Privacy Commissioner about that actual or possible breach. 

We only keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected or as otherwise required by law. We take appropriate measures to destroy or permanently de-identify your personal information when we no longer need to retain it. These  measures may vary depending on the type of personal information concerned, the way it was collected and how it is stored.   

#### How your personal information will be used           
                                                                    

We collect your personal information so that we can use it for our functions and activities and to provide services to you, which include, amongst other things:

  * processing your flight booking and any flight booking of a person travelling with you;
  * being aware of any special travel requirements (health or otherwise) you or your travelling companion may have;
  * providing you with confirmation of your flight booking and advising you of any changes to your itinerary;
  * confirming your identity when you check in;
  * processing your purchase of in-flight services such as video, entertainment, food and beverages; 
  * processing and considering your employment application (refer to "Employment Application" section below);
  * addressing any feedback or complaints you may have;
  * assisting Customs and Immigration officials;
  * answering any queries you may have;
  * developing and marketing our products and services;
  * conducting research about our products and services; and
  * collecting payment from you for services or goods we supply to you.



If you do not provide us with your personal information, we will be unable to do one or more of the above (including being unable to accept any flight booking).

If you also subscribe to our mailing list, we may email to you updates about our products and services. If you do not wish to remain a subscriber to our mailing list or otherwise receive updates on our products and services, you are able to unsubscribe from our mailing list via our website, or by contacting our Guest Contact Centre.

If you are making a flight booking for yourself and other persons to the same destination, you acknowledge that your personal information will be shared with such other persons.

#### Exchange of personal information with third parties     

Personal information we collect from you may be disclosed:

  * to any entity to which we are required or authorised by or under law to disclose such information (for instance, law enforcement agencies and investigative agencies, courts, various other government bodies);
  * to our subsidiaries, other related entities, contractors or agents for the purposes set out in the section above entitled "How your personal information will be used", or for other purposes directly related to the purpose for which the personal information is collected;

Such disclosure may include the transfer of your personal information between Australia and Canada, Cook Islands, Fiji, Indonesia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Thailand, Tonga, United Kingdom, United States of America and Vanuatu.  You consent to your personal information being disclosed to these overseas recipients unless you advise the Privacy Officer or the Guest Contact Centre otherwise.  Please note that if you do not authorise us to transfer your personal information, it may limit the services we can provide to you or may prevent us from supplying services to you.

We may also obtain personal and other information from some or all of the third parties listed above to enable us to provide our services or products to you. When we obtain personal and other information from third parties whom we are referred to by you, we will assume and you will ensure that you have made that third party aware of the referral of the persons and purposes involved in the collection, use and disclosure of the relevant personal or other information.

#### Use and disclosure of personal information by us                                                                     


If we use or disclose your personal information for a purpose (the "secondary purpose") other the main reason for which it was originally collected (the "primary purpose"), to the extent required by law, we will ensure that: 

  * the secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection (and directly related in the case of sensitive information), and you would reasonably expect that we would use or disclose your information in that way; or
  * you have consented to the use or disclosure of your personal information for the secondary purpose; or
  * the use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or
  * the use or disclosure is otherwise permitted by law (for example, as a necessary part of an investigation of suspected unlawful activity).



#### Employment Applications

Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you is the information included in your application, for example, your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, career history, education details or other information relating to your career. 

In considering your application, we may also obtain personal information about you from third parties, for example, from your previous employers or nominated referees. We may also collect sensitive information about you such as information about your health (including any disability) or any criminal record that you may have.

We collect personal information for any one or more of the following purposes:

  * Assess you for a position or positions with us or our related entities;
  * Assess whether you are suitable to progress to each stage of the recruitment process for a vacant position; or
  * Store your information for future job opportunities.



If you do not provide us with the information we seek, we will be unable to do one or more of the above.

We may disclose your personal information to:

  * organisations that conduct competency or psychometric tests;
  * referees or previous employers;
  * recruitment agencies or related entities acting on our behalf;
  * our related entities;
  * law enforcement agencies to verify whether you have a criminal record; or
  * educational or vocational organisations to the extent necessary to verify your qualifications.



If we engage third party contractors to perform services for us which involves handling personal information we will take reasonable steps to prohibit the contractor from using personal information except for the purposes for which it was supplied.
