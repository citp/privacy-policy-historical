## Virginia.gov Internet Privacy Policy

### Virginia law

We protect our records in accordance with our obligations as defined by applicable Virginia statutes, including, but not limited to, the “Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act,” Chapter 38 of Title 2.2 of the Code of Virginia (§ 2.2-3800 and 2.2-3803), “Administration of systems including personal information; Internet privacy policy; exceptions” Code of Virginia, § 2.2-3803, the “Virginia Freedom of Information Act” § 2.2-3700, et seq., and by any applicable U.S. federal laws. Any personal information that is collected and retained is maintained in compliance with statute.

### Information we collect

We collect only the minimum amount of information needed to provide services. If you do nothing during your visit to the [virginia.gov](https://virginia.gov/) website but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

  1. The Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed our site;
  2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
  3. The date and time you visited this site;
  4. The pages visited; and
  5. If you arrived from another website, the address of that website.



The information in our web logs is not personally identifiable, and no attempt is made to link it with the individuals that browse our website.

If, during your visit, you send us an e-mail message, we will collect the e-mail address and contents of the message, including audio, video and graphic information formats you send us. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our website or to forward your message to another agency for appropriate action.

We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to complete forms or participate in surveys, in order to deliver the services requested. We only collect, retain and use personal information where we believe it is essential to administer our business and to provide products, services and other opportunities requested by our customers.

### How the collected information is used

Your input is used to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our pages. Routing information is used to send requested web pages to your computer for viewing. Transaction routing information is used primarily in a statistical summary format to assess content and server performance. We may share this summary information with our business partners when needed.

We may keep your information indefinitely, but we ordinarily delete routing information regularly after the web page is transmitted. However, on rare occasions when a “hacker” attempts to breach computer security, logs and any other relevant information in our possession may be shared with law enforcement agencies.

Optional information is retained in accordance with the records retention schedule at the Library of Virginia.

Under the “Virginia Freedom of Information Act” (FOIA), any records in our possession at the time of a “Freedom of Information Request” might be subject to inspection by or disclosure to members of the public. However, identifiable personal information will be removed prior to such release in accordance with FOIA.

### Restrictions on the disclosure of customer information

We do not sell or rent our subscribers’ information to any outside company or organization. We do not reveal specific information about users or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except if required to do so by FOIA or other law.
