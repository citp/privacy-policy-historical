**(4)   What about Cookies?**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser and to automatically collect information from your computer such as your IP address and other details about your computer which are automatically collected by our web server, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.  This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

The "Help" menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.  Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Virgin Active’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

If you do leave cookies turned on, be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control:

  * To recognise you when you return to our Site.



**(5)   Does Virgin Active Limited share the information it receives?**

Information about our members is an important part of our business and we do not sell it to others. Virgin Active shares member information only as described below.  If you have joined us via a Corporate Medical Aid rewards programme, you consent to us sharing your information with the relevant Corporate.

  * **Third Party Service Providers**  
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from member lists, analysing data, and providing marketing assistance.  Third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and as permitted by South African data protection legislation.


  * **Promotional Offers**  
Sometimes we send offers to members on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address.  If you do not want to receive such offers, please let us know in writing.


  * **Business Transfers  
**As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy health clubs or subsidiaries or business units.  In such transactions, member information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy (unless, of course, the member consents otherwise).  Also, in the unlikely event that Virgin Active or substantially all of its assets are acquired, personal information will of course be one of the transferred assets.


  * **Protection of Virgin Active and other** s  
We release account and other personal information when we believe that such a release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our membership or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Virgin Active, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from members for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this privacy policy.



With your consent, other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalise advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this privacy policy.

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information.  If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, tick the opt-out box in your terms and conditions or let us know in writing if you don’t want to receive these offers.  However, please note, if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this privacy policy, those notices will still govern your use of Virgin Active and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.
