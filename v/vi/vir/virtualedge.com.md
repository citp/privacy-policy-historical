Please take the time to review this document. This statement discloses:

VirtualEdge.com Online Privacy Statement 

This statement describes our practices with regard to the personal information we collect at VirtualEdge.com. VirtualEdge is the sole owner of the personal information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what we disclose in this statement. 

             _Information We Collect_

We collect personal information from website visitors who provide it to us voluntarily. This information may include name, address, e-mail address, social security number and the user's interest in VirtualEdge products and services. Whether you provide any identifiable information is entirely up to you. 

             _Other Information_

  * Log Files - VirtualEdge uses IP addresses, referring urls, date and time stamps to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. VirtualEdge will only use this information to support the successful use of our applications. 
  * Cookies - We strive to make a user's experience at VirtualEdge.com easy and meaningful. When a user visits our site, our Web server sends a cookie to the user's computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place in a computer's hard drive or memory. Cookies come in two types: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist in a computer's memory only during an online session. They disappear from a user's computer when the user closes the browser software or turns off the computer. Persistent cookies remain on a user's computer after a user has closed the browser or turned off the computer. These cookies include such information as unique identifiers for users' browsers. 

VirtualEdge requires cookies only to store information required to maintain session management. VirtualEdge.com uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify a user while supplying information required to receive newsletters or download White Papers. This information allows VirtualEdge.com to process online transactions and requests. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will not be able to successfully use our site. 


             _Uses and Disclosures of Personal Information_

We use the personal information for the following purposes: 

  * We respond to our users' requests for information, white papers and newsletters; 
  * We periodically send our users other information about our products and services; 
  * We may use contact information collected through the white paper collection form as a sales lead generator; and 
  * We use information collected via log files and cookies to help tailor our website and manage navigation and administrative tasks. 
  * If you submit a resume or employment application to us, we will use it only for hiring and client HR purposes. 

Unless you tell us not to, we may also provide information about you to other ADP affiliates and to third parties so they can send you information about the products and services they offer. We may also share your information with other third parties who perform services for us, but we forbid these companies from using your personal information for their own purposes. 

In addition, we may provide aggregate statistics about visitors to our sites, such as volume, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information. We may also disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) enforce the website terms and conditions of use; or (d) act to protect the interests of our users or others. We may also disclose information about you in connection with the transfer of assets of our business. 

             _Choices Regarding Collection, Use, and Distribution of Your Information_

If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may, from time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and services. If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can easily indicate that by checking the appropriate box on the submission form. You may also opt out of our emails by following the instructions provided in each message. 

             _Correcting, Accessing, and Updating Your Information_

You may view and edit your personally identifiable information by contacting us using the link provided on the website. 

             _Information Security_

We take reasonable steps to help prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. For example, we have implemented physical, logical, and administrative procedures to protect and secure the information we process and maintain. We also use encryption and firewall technologies to protect sensitive information during online transmissions. 

             _Notification of Changes_

From time to time, we may use client information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this Privacy Statement. If we make a material change to the way we plan to use or disclosure your information, we will post the policy changes and we will also notify you via email and give you an opportunity to opt-out of the new data uses. 

             _Links to Other Sites_

Our site may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites. 

             _Contact Us with Any Questions_

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us at [AMS_Privacy@adp.com](mailto:ams_privacy@adp.com). 

ASP Privacy Statement

Our ASP Privacy Statement applies strictly to the transmission of personal information received by VirtualEdge, through its hosted workforce acquisition software (E*TRACK System™), supplied directly by our clients, or by the visitors to our client career centers, for employment consideration (Hosted Employee Information). 

We collect and use Hosted Employee Information only as instructed by our clients, the data owners/controllers. We contractually commit to our clients not to use the personal information for our own purposes. We are also contractually required to use reasonable means to secure the personal information. For information provided to us for hosting by individuals in Europe, VirtualEdge has joined the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor to assure adequate protection for the information at all times. Please see our [Safe Harbor Privacy Statement](https://www.virtualedge.com/login/Index.cfm?FuseAction=privacy#SafeHarbor) below for more information about our commitment to protecting personal information from Europe. 

This ASP Privacy Statement does not reflect the privacy practices of our clients and VirtualEdge is not responsible for its clients' privacy policies or practices. VirtualEdge does not review, comment upon or monitor its clients' compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does VirtualEdge review its clients' instructions to determine whether they are in compliance with or conflict with the terms of a client's published privacy policy. 

If you have submitted personal information to a company via a VirtualEdge hosted career center, you should contact that company to understand its own privacy practices. 

Safe Harbor Privacy Statement

We participate in the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Frameworks as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. This means that, for personal information that individuals in the European Economic Area and Switzerland provide to us for processing on behalf of our clients, we have committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles.
