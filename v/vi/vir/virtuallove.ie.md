Privacy policy

This website is owned and operated by VirtualLove.ie | Easy Finder Group, Office 2, Beechfied Avenue, Dublin. 

VirtualLove.ie has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your right to privacy and data protection. We handle all our information gathering and dissemination procedures with every reasonable safeguard for your protection.

We confirm that all personal data handled and stored by us is done so in strict compliance with the EU Data Protection Rules. 

This allows you to understand how your data is being protected. 

What information do we process?

We collect the information set out below from you during the registration process and your use of the VirtualLove.ie service. By submitting this information (including sensitive personal information), you are explicitly agreeing to us processing that information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Please remember that due to the nature of the VirtualLove.ie service, any information that is disclosed to VirtualLove.ie, except the guarantees of privacy that are stated below, can become public information. You should therefore exercise caution when disclosing personal information. 

On registration with the website

On initial registration we collect personal information such as your name, date of birth, e-mail address and postal address. We use this information for administrative purposes and to provide you with the VirtualLove.ie service. So for example, we use your e-mail address to send you our newsletters and special offers (if you have chosen to receive them) and we use some of this information to help create your profile. For further information on how we use this information (in a non-identifiable way) for your profile, please see below. 

My Profile:

To allow other registered users to be able to view a profile about you VirtualLove.ie creates one from a combination of the registration data and personality test results in the My Profile section, which has links to the part of our service where you can upload photographs of yourself. You are also given the opportunity to change the description of yourself. We use the information you provide about your personal preferences (collated on registration and in the My Profile section) to help match you to a potential partner. Some of this information will be visible by other members, such as age, marital status, height, region, occupation etc. Your name, email address, home address and other specific 'identifier' data will NOT be visible to other users. Please remember that you can choose to delete or hide your profile at any time by selecting the relevant option in the 'My VirtualLove.ie/Data & Settings' section of the website.

Information that you disclose to us may be disclosed to employees and agents of VirtualLove.ie for them to administer your account and the gay-VirtualLove.ie service.

Our users

If you are a registered user, you are publicly identified on the website by an anonymous number code; your user name is not visible to other VirtualLove.ie members.

Co-branded sites

Sometimes we enter into promotional arrangements with carefully selected partners where we operate a website branded with both our and their branding. We call this a co-branded site. If you registered as a member through a co-branded site, then we will share the information that you disclose on registration (but no other information) with that co-branding partner. Please check their privacy policy to see how they will use your information. We will give you details of how to access their privacy policy when you first register.

If ownership or operational control of all or part of this website is transferred, your information may be disclosed to a transferee, but we would require them to use that information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.
