										<h2>VRX's PRIVACY COMMITMENT</h2>
										<p><span class="heading">VRX's Commitment to Privacy</span><br>
											VRX Studios Inc. Inc. (VRX) is committed to protecting your privacy and the 
											security of your personal information. VRX will continue to review and revise 
											its policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of 
											personal information to better protect individuals' privacy. This may result in 
											changes to VRX policy from time to time.
											<br>
											<br>
											In the course of its commercial activities and, in particular, when providing 
											services to its clients, VRX collects personal information about its clients.
											<br>
											<br>
											VRX's privacy principles only apply to personal information about identifiable 
											individuals but does not include the name, title, business address or telephone 
											number of an employee of an organization, or anonymous or aggregated 
											information. In the context of this policy, the term "clients" includes all 
											current, former and prospective clients.</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Why 
            does VRX Collect Personal Information? </span><br>
											VRX may use personal information to provide business services; for billing, 
											record-keeping and other client contact and service matters; for audit and 
											record-keeping purposes; for account collection purposes; to manage and develop 
											its business and operations; to learn about the needs of current and potential 
											clients, to develop or offer services and products tailored to those needs and 
											to communicate with those clients regarding current and future products and 
											services; and to follow up on client comments and suggestions.
											<br>
											<br>
											In the normal course of business, VRX does not share or sell any personally 
											identifiable information to third parties. VRX may however share information in 
											an anonymous aggregate form, among its affiliates.</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Collection of Personal Information</span><br>
											VRX collects, uses and discloses personal information only for the purposes 
											that a reasonable person would consider appropriate - and only by lawful and 
											fair means. Whenever possible, VRX collects personal information about clients 
											and other individuals directly from those parties or through referrals by 
											persons whom such parties have requested to provide us with such information.</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Disclosure of Personal Information</span><br>
											VRX will only disclose personal information for the purposes related to 
											providing services, or with a person's express consent, or otherwise if 
											required or authorized by law. For example, VRX may disclose a person's 
											information when the business services that VRX provides to that person require 
											VRX to give the personal information to third parties; where it is necessary to 
											establish or collect fees; if VRX engages third party service providers on the 
											client's behalf, including data processing or accounting; or if a court issues 
											a sub-poena.
										</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Consent</span><br>
											We may obtain personal consent to the collection, use and disclosure of 
											personal information either expressly, for stated purposes or impliedly when 
											the purposes are not stated expressly but are indicated by the relevant 
											circumstances or follow logically from other expressly stated purposes. A 
											person may withdraw or amend any consent previously given by
											<a id="lbtnPrivacyOfficer" href="javascript:__doPostBack('lbtnPrivacyOfficer','')">contacting VRX's Privacy Officer</a>, 
											subject to any legal or contractual restrictions and upon reasonable notice to 
											VRX.
											<br>
											<br>
											A person's consent to collect certain personal information may be required in 
											order for VRX to provide business services. However, as a condition of 
											providing a service VRX will not require that personal information not related 
											to providing such service be provided.</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Updating Personal Information</span><br>
											Because VRX uses personal information to provide business services to clients 
											or make decisions related to employment, it is important that personal 
											information be accurate and up-to-date.
											<br>
											<br>
											If any of your information changes, please inform us so that we can make any 
											necessary changes.
										</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Safety of Personal Information</span><br>
											VRX uses appropriate security measures to protect against loss, theft, 
											unauthorized access, disclosure, use or modification of personal information. 
											Such measures will vary depending on the sensitivity, amount, format, nature 
											and storage of the personal information and will involve physical, 
											organizational and electronic security measures.
											<br>
											<br>
											VRX may occasionally transfer personal information to trusted third-party 
											providers. VRX requires that these third-party service providers offer a level 
											of security that meets the standards established by VRX.</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Access to Personal Information</span><br>
											VRX will respond promptly to any request for access to personal information. 
											There will be no cost for reasonable requests to such access, unless one 
											requests copies of records, or when retrieval costs are excessive. VRX will 
											advise of the cost, if any, prior to the retrieval of such records or 
											information. VRX will not respond to requests for access to personal 
											information where it is not required by law to do so, including frivolous or 
											vexatious requests.
											<br>
											<br>
											In certain circumstances, VRX may be unable to provide access to some or all of 
											the personal information that it holds about a person. Such circumstances 
											include those in which the personal information cannot be separated from the 
											records of others, cannot be disclosed for reasons of personal security or 
											commercial confidentiality (including, in relation to VRX) or is protected by 
											professional standards relating to confidentiality or solicitor-client 
											privilege.
										</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Correcting Errors</span><br>
											If VRX holds information that is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, VRX 
											will take appropriate steps to correct it upon notification, where permitted or 
											required by law.</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Website</span><br>
											The VRX website may contain links to other sites, which are not governed by the 
											privacy policy of VRX. VRX may monitor traffic patterns, site usage and related 
											site information in order to optimize its web service. VRX may provide 
											aggregated information to third parties, but these statistics do not include 
											any identifiable personal information.
										</p>
										<p><span class="heading">Questions, Concerns, Requests for 
            Access</span><br>
											For questions relating to this notice, to access personal information or to 
											change preferences regarding our use of registered users' information, please 
											contact VRX's Privacy Officer at 1.604.687.8032 or use this
