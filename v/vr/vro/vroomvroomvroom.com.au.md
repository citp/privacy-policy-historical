We also collect the following information from you when you use our website:

  * anonymous non-personal information about how you use our website; and  

  * “cookie” based information that makes your use of our website easier by recording your preferences so that when you return to our website the “cookie” re-loads that information into your web browser. More information set out below.

  * our business partners; and  

  * third parties who supply services to us.



## Why we collect, use and disclose personal information

We will use the personal information we collect for the purpose disclosed at the time of collection, or otherwise as set out in this Privacy Policy.  We will not use your personal information for any other purpose without first seeking your consent, or where authorised or required by law.

We will collect personal information for the following purposes:

  * to establish and maintain your relationship with us;  

  * to provide the products or services you have requested from us; or  

  * to answer any inquiry you make.  




We will disclose personal information as required to the providers of the products and services you have purchased (such as car rental and insurance companies). You accept that not all recipients of your information may have privacy policies or be subject to privacy laws equivalent to us and consent to the disclosure of your personal information for that purpose. 

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties who work with us in our business to provide, promote or improve the products or services you have requested or are interested in, such as:

  * marketing consultants and promotions companies; website hosts;  

  * consultants and professional advisers  

  * your company or organisation if you use our services under a corporate account;   

  * one of our program partners if you are a member of their frequent traveller program and you have asked us to send them details of your rental agreement with us;   

  * our contracted service providers (including our payment gateway, market research company and our mail house);   

  * debit and credit card providers;   

  * banks;  

  * credit reporting and fraud checking agencies;   

  * debt collection agencies, if you default in payment of monies owed to us;

  * us; and  

  * our related bodies corporate.  




The direct marketing may relate to: 

  * our products and services;  

  * the products and services of other parties (such as car rental and insurance companies);  

  * new developments we believe may be of interest to you.  




You may opt-out of receiving this direct marketing through the unsubscribe function that will be made available to you with each direct marketing communication.

## How we store and protect personal information

We store personal information in a combination of computer storage facilities, paper-based files and other records. In so doing, we have taken numerous steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

Additionally, we take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when we no longer need it.

The internet is not a secure method of transmitting information. Accordingly, other than where we use secure socket layer technology (SSL) to ensure information is securely transmitted and processed, we cannot and do not accept responsibility for the security of information you send to or receive from us over the internet, or for any unauthorised access or use of that information.

## Do we send personal information overseas? 

We are likely to disclose some of your personal information, for the purposes described above, to organisations in New Zealand, United Kingdom, USA, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Ireland.

Some of these countries may not have the same or substantially similar privacy laws as those set out in this privacy policy and the Australian Privacy Principles.  We may not require organisations to which we disclose personal information in those countries to comply with similar privacy laws, and accordingly your personal information may not receive the same protections that it would in Australia. 

By providing your personal information to us, you consent to our disclosure of your personal information to organisations in those countries even though it may not receive the same protections that it would in Australia.  You may request us not to transfer your personal information to the countries listed above, but if you do so we may not be able to provide the services or products you have requested from us. 

## How you can access your personal information

We will take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date. If your personal details change, such as your address or phone number, please contact our Privacy Officer by email or at the address detailed below.

At your request, we will provide you with a copy of any personal information which we hold about you, unless an exception under the Privacy Act 1988 applies. We may charge a fee for retrieving this information, in which case we will inform you of the fee and obtain your agreement to that fee before providing the information.

We will promptly acknowledge and investigate any complaint about the way we manage personal information.
