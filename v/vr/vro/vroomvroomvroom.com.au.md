## TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF BOOKINGS

**VroomVroomVroom** acts as a broker between you (the client) and the car hire companies. **Your rental is subject to the rental terms and conditions of the car hire company with whom the reservation is made**. For example: bookings made with Avis will be subject to the Avis terms and conditions at the time of renting.

**"Fun Deals" and value specials:**  
VroomVroomVroom has negotiated VroomVroomVroom Deals and specials for you that result in real value that we pass on to you. To receive the benefits from Avis, Hertz, Europcar and Thrifty all bookings must be initiated via the VroomVroomVroom.com.au site. This will ensure that the VroomVroomVroom.com.au value code is inserted into the reservation form for each company. Any reservation not made via the VroomVroomVroom.com.au site will not insert the VroomVroomVroom.com.au value code and therefore not receive the applicable VroomVroomVroom Deal.

**Multiple reservations:**  
If after placing a reservation you need to repeat the reservation process (eg. if a second reservation is required) from VroomVroomVroom.com.au, start at the GET A QUOTE link to ensure the discounted rates are applied again.

**Optional Insurance:**  
Renters incur a standard damage excess fee when a vehicle is damaged or in an accident. This amount will be advised during the reservation process. The damage excess fee can be reduced to a lower amount by paying an optional excess reduction fee upon vehicle pickup.

**Payment:**  
The rental amount is **_payable upon vehicle pickup directly to the car hire company_**. All major credit cards are accepted. Credit card details may be required to secure the reservation at the time of booking however the payable amount will not be debited until you collect the vehicle and sign the rental contract.

**Changes and Cancellations:**  
Once the reservation is made, **_amendments and/or cancellations are to be made via the car hire company with whom the reservation is made._** See the " **Make Changes** " page for direct access to the respective car hire company amendment pages. You will need your Booking Number.
