            <h2 class="heading heading--2">Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                vrcosplayx.com takes your privacy seriously. This Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using vrcosplayx.com (the “site”). Please read it carefully. If you are a vrcosplayx.com member, you may contact us regarding this Privacy Policy by logging in to your account at vrcosplayx.com, clicking on the “Support” tab and using the “Contact Us” feature.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading heading--2">Not Intended for Minors</h2>
            <p>
                The content on the site is intended for adults only. No person under 18 is allowed to use this site or to disclose information on this site.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading heading--2">Access Information Collected</h2>

            <h3 class="heading heading--3">Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Like most Web sites, vrcosplayx.com uses cookies. A “cookie” is a small piece of data that a Web site stores in a designated file on your computer. Cookies are commonly used to store user names and/or passwords to facilitate access to the site. Cookies can also be used to store, among other things, user preferences, login dates and times, and content viewing history. When you visit a Web site, that site can access only that information which it stored in a cookie — not information put in a cookie by other Web sites. Cookies make your online experience easier and more personalized.

                vrcosplayx.com uses cookies and other technologies to recognize you and to provide personalization, as well as to help us understand how our site is used. Users must have cookies enabled in order for the site to function properly.

                Cookies help vrcosplayx.com and its affiliates and advertisers track users’ activities for the purpose of counting and crediting views, clicks, referrals and purchases. The cookies themselves tell vrcosplayx.com nothing about the user personally. vrcosplayx.com also lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading heading--3">Server Log and Clickstream Data</h3>
            <p>
                Our site’s servers also automatically identify your computer by its Internet Protocol address (a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider) each time you access the site, and maintain logs of the specific content on the site that you access. Our servers also record various information pertaining to your computer configuration, including but not limited to the Web browser software you use, the resolution settings of your monitor, and the Web site from which you were referred to the site, if any.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading heading--2">User Information Collected</h2>
                <p>
                Certain functionality of the site is available only to registered users of the site (“Users”). In order to become a User, we require you to supply the following information:
                <br><br>
                First and last name<br>
                Email address<br>
                ZIP Code<br>
                State/Province<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We may occasionally ask you to provide other demographic information, such as income and education level. You are not required to provide such information in order to become a User. Such information is treated in the same manner as the User Information identified above.

                We require you to select a unique user name. Please note that your user name is not “User Information” for the purpose of this privacy policy, and will be visible to other users of the site (for example, to identify you as the author of certain posts, or in a list of Users logged in at a given time). Accordingly, if you do not wish to disclose your identity to others on the site, you should select a user name that does not include any personally identifiable information.

                Users may upload content including posts, comments on others’ posts, and audiovisual works. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information contained in, or ascertainable from, the content you upload to the site. By uploading content to the site, you waive any claim to privacy rights in connection with information contained in, or ascertainable from, such content.
