# VRChat - Privacy

Effective Date: May 31, 2017

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the manner in which VRChat, Inc. (“VRChat”, “we,” or “us”) and our website at www.vrchat.com (our “Site”), as well as all related websites, networks, desktop or mobile clients and applications, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, our “Service”) collect, use, and disclose information about you. This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the VRChat Terms of Use and End User License Agreement. By using the Service, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Policy. 

####  Information We Collect on the Service 

User-provided Information: 

When you use the Service, we may collect or you may provide information about you and we may link this information with other information about you. You may provide us with information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with information when you register for an account (we will collect your email address, birthday, and allow you to create a username and password), subscribe to our newsletters, use the Service, make a purchase on the Service, or send us customer service-related requests. 

Cookies and Automatically Collected Information: 

When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. We may use third party cookies on our Service as well. For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. To learn more about how Google Analytics uses your information and what choices you have, please visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). VRChat does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service. 

We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you. 

Information Disclosed While Using the Service: 

When using the Service, including participation in different “rooms” made available to users of the virtual-reality component of our Service, you may disclose to us and to other users of the Service information about you. This may occur when you engage in conversations, chats, or other user-to-user interactions. We may collect and use this information to the extent permitted by law. 

Payment Information: 

If you choose to access or use parts of the Service that require payments or fees, we may require you to provide financial information to us for the purpose of processing those payments. We may provide your payment information to third party payment processors who process transactions on our behalf. We may also collect and retain information relating to the transactions you conduct. 

Location Information: 

We may use your IP address to obtain general information about the physical location from which you are connecting to the Internet. 

Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons: 

We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by VRChat. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. Please note that privacy choices you have made on VRChat will not carry over to third party sites or services (and vice-versa). 

Information from Other Sources: 

We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners and advertisers. 

####  How We Use the Information We Collect. We use information we collect on the Service (in both individual and aggregate format) in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following 

We use the information that we collect on the Service to operate, maintain, enhance and provide the Service, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users, and to process and deliver entries and rewards in connection with promotions that may be offered from time to time on the Service. 

We use the information that we collect on the Service to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the Service, and to develop new products, services, features, and functionality. 

We may use your email address or other information we collect to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service or to send communications, including required notices, marketing communications, or updates on promotions and events relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties. 

We may use information to: (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering information about you so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Service and third-party marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; (v) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities on the Service; and (vi) detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Service. 

####  When We Disclose Information. Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose information about you that we collect on the Service to third parties without your consent. We may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances 

We work with third party service providers who provide website, application development, hosting, payment, maintenance, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process information about you as part of providing those services for us. We require our service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information. 

We may disclose information about you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws, in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies. 

We also reserve the right to disclose information about you that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Service and any facilities or equipment used to make the Service available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others. 

Information about our users may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. 

We may make certain aggregate or otherwise non-personal or de-identified information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service. 

####  Your Choices 

You may, of course, decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service. You may update your profile information through the Service. If you wish to access, update, delete or amend any other personal information we hold about you, you may contact us at support@vrchat.com. Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.

You may also opt out from receiving commercial email from us by sending your request to us by email at support@vrchat.com or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy.

Please be aware that if you opt out of receiving commercial email from us or otherwise modify the nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from us, it may take up to ten business days for us to process your request, and you may continue receiving promotional communications from us during that period. Additionally, even after you opt out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us regarding the Service.

The Service may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.
