# Privacy Policy - VR Cover

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.



 **Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, VR Cover collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use the website.

VR Cover also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. VR Cover only discloses logged in user  IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

 **Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to VR Cover’s websites choose to interact with VR Cover in ways that require VR Cover to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that VR Cover gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, for purchases we require personal information such as your name, an address and phone number to make the delivery of goods possible. Those who wish to receive updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, VR Cover collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with VR Cover. VR Cover does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

VR Cover may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, we may monitor the most popular pages on our site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using VR Cover’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. VR Cover will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, VR Cover discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when VR Cover believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of VR Cover, third parties or the public at large. If you have signed up to the VR Cover newsletter and have supplied your email address, VR Cover may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new products, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on in the VR world. VR Cover takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
