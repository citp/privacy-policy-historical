vCita, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “vCita”) respect the privacy of users (a “User” or “Users”) and experts (an “Expert” or “Experts”) alike. This privacy policy explains vCita’s privacy practices in connection with the use of the web-application (the “Web-App”) operated by vCita for Expert and Users and the services rendered through the Web-App by Expert to User (the “Services”). It also describes the ways vCita collects and uses personal information of Users and Experts and the rights and options available to Users and Experts with respect to their information.

This privacy policy is incorporated into the [Terms of Service](https://www.vcita.com/about/terms_of_service) between vCita and Expert (the “Agreement”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Agreement.

THIS PRIVACY POLICY ONLY GOVERNS VCITA’S USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE USE OF USER’S PERSONAL INFORMATION BY EXPERT (OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES) IS NOT CONTROLLED BY VCITA, AND USER SHOULD REVIEW EXPERT’S PRIVACY POLICY INDEPENDENTLY. VCITA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE AND WILL BEAR NO LIABILITY TO EXPERT’S PRIVACY POLICY OR TO EXPERT’S COMPLIANCE WITH IT.
