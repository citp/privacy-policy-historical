Everyone treated at one of our facilities has a health record.  These records contain documents such as reports from care providers, test results and pharmacy information. 

All of your records are kept strictly confidential. Protecting your privacy is our priority. 

We collect, use and disclose your information only where permitted or authorized to under the BC Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. 

Who can access my information?Our staff, physicians and other authorized individuals collect, use and share your personal information to deliver health services. 

They may use and share your information for the following purposes: 

  * For your immediate and ongoing care

  * To help improve your quality of care and services

  * For research purposes, if authorized and permitted by law

  * To understand your eligibility for benefits and services and to arrange payment

  * To create an electronic patient and or client record




Your personal information may also be disclosed to other authorized individuals as required by law (e.g. to respond to a court order) or under a specific statute (e.g. the Coroner’s Act or Adult Guardianship Act).

How is my information shared? We use electronic records to share information efficiently and improve the quality of care we deliver. 

We record your information in our electronic clinical systems and use a shared electronic health record, CareConnect, to provide a single point of access for patient medical information. 

We also have access to patient identifiers in the Ministry of Health’s Electronic Master Patient Index, which we use to confirm your identity and for audit purposes. 

Is my information secure? We use a variety of safeguards to protect your electronic information including encryption, passwords and access audits. The more sensitive the information, the more protected it is. 

The __ E-Health (Personal Health Information Access and Protection of Privacy Act) is new legislation that covers designated Health Information Banks. In future, we may also share your personal information where permitted under this legislation.

What if I don’t want others to know I am in one of your facilities? It is standard practice to tell people who phone to ask about you for us to confirm you have been admitted to one of our facilities. If you don’t want this information to be released, let a staff member know and they will make a note on your file saying not to release any information about you.
