Revised last: May 1, 2011

This Privacy Policy describes vChatter's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. We may receive your information through vChatter, mobile apps, and third-parties.  
This Privacy Policy covers all of vChatter. It does not apply to entities that we do not own or control. By using vChatter you consent to the uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Your information may be used by us in the United States or any other country where vChatter operates.

### Controlling and Modifying Your Personal Information

Our goal is to provide you flexibility in using your personal information to connect with other users while safe-guarding your privacy by giving you control over your private information. If you have used our Services, you know that you have tools to control the disclosure of your personal information to other users and groups on vChatter. We also provide you tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us.

### Our Policy Towards Children

Our Services are not to be used by anyone under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account. We recommend that minors over the age of 18 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

### How we Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to try to improve the Services and provide a safe and customized experience for you. Our efforts to reach these goals include: 

  * To continually improve our Services by collecting data on where improvements can be made, improve features, and to provide you with superior customer support. 
  * To contact you with Services-related messages for which you have control over their receipt in your privacy settings. 
  * To serve personalized advertising to you without sharing your personal information with advertisers without your consent. 
  * To supplement your profile with information that we collect from other users. Again, you generally have control over such information and whether it is displayed to some or all of the users on vChatter. 
  * To make suggestions to you in using our Services.
  * To help users connect with each other in groups or personally through a following relationship.
  * To provide a pleasant user experience by monitoring vChatter and broadcasts and reserving the right to restrict or ban the users who use the Services inappropriately or in violation of any of our terms or policies. 



### Information Collection and Use

  * **Information Collected Upon Registration:** When you create a vChatter account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, password, birthdate, phone number, photo, and email address. Some information from your profile, for example, your name and photo, is listed publicly on vChatter, including on your profile page and in search results.
  * **Additional Information:** You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, to help connect you with other users and groups on vChatter. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with Content you submit on vChatter, please remove the metadata before uploading the Content. You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you find other users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site.
  * **Contacts Information:** We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your contacts' addresses so that you can find followers on vChatter, and invite your contacts who do not have vChatter accounts to join. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you have uploaded your contacts' information.
  * **Log Data:** Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.
  * **Links:** vChatter may keep track of how you interact with links in messages across our Services including third party clients by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics.
  * **Cookies:** We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for a period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make our Services easier to use, to improve advertising, and to protect both you and the vChatter community.
  * **Third Party Services:** We use a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services and to help us understand how our users are using our Services. These other services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.
  * **Information from other users:** We may collect information about you from your interactions with other users.



### Information Sharing and Disclosure

vChatter is about connecting you with other users and groups. This requires users to share a certain amount of information with other users. We promote this while also providing you with privacy controls that enable you to restrict other users from accessing some of your information. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer the Services, or when legally required to do so. For example:

  * Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your vChatter account.
  * Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this Privacy Policy.
  * Law and Harm: We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property.
  * Business Transfers: In the event that vChatter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
  * Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public Tweets or the number of users who clicked on a particular link.
