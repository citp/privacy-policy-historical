<p>vcaster.tv are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>

	<p>This policy (together with our Terms of Use and vcaster.tv! End User Licence Agreement (and any other documents referred to therein) describes the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>

	<p>Unless otherwise defined below, defined terms referred to in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set out in the vcaster.tv! Terms of Use.<br>
How we collect information</p>

	<p>We may collect and process the following information about you:</p>

	<p>1. In order to access the vcaster.tv! service for the first time, you may be asked to create a user account by providing information including your first and last name, a valid email address and a password made up of alpha numeric characters. Subsequently, you may be asked to sign in using your registered email address and password, which we refer to as your "credentials". As part of creating your user account, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password, as well as an alternate email address. Finally, a unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials which will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.</p>

	<p>2. We ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, company name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your <span class="caps">ZIP</span> or postal code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favourites.</p>

	<p>3. We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Site and other  vcaster.tv sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.</p>

	<p>4. When you use the Services to distribute User Content to other Users of the Services, we may collect information about the User Content you are distributing including the title, description, genre, type (audio or video) and location information. In addition, if you use the vcaster.tv! User Microsite or Channel page feature, you will be able to create and edit your own page on the Site, which will contain addition information about you (that you provide) and which will be visible to other users of the Services.</p>

	<p>5. When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail, we may use web beacons, customised links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.</p>

	<p>6. In order to offer you a more consistent and personalised experience in your interactions with the Services and us, information collected through one vcaster.tv service may be combined with information obtained through other vcaster.tv services.
