                     committed, or if we are required to do so by law or appropriate authority; or
           b)        in the case of an actual or proposed (including negotiations for a) sale or merger
                     or business combination involving all or the relevant part of our business.

           purposes stated in this privacy policy.

           purposes stated in this policy.

           our site, different rules will apply to their use or disclosure of your information and you
           should contact those parties if you require more information.
9.         How can you access and rectify personal data?
9.1        You have the right to request personal data that we hold about you, subject to us
           reserving the right to withhold such data to the extent permitted by law. We may charge
           an administration fee in line with data protection laws and we may also require
           appropriate evidence of identity. Note that you may be able to rectify certain of your
           personal data within your account on our service (if applicable).
