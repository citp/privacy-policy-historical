## Privacy Policy

This site is powered by BetVictor. At BetVictor we take the security of your data very seriously. The following policy outlines our obligation and commitment to you based on the Gibraltar Data Protection Act 2004 and the principles held within that Act. It will also inform you of the type of processing that is carried out with your personal data once it has been collected. By using the site you acknowledge and accept both the terms and conditions of this privacy policy and the purposes and methods of processing for which your data is collected.

**Information collected and how it is used**

When you open and subsequently use your BetVictor account, specific data is collected, such as: Name, address, age, email address, telephone number etc, which is collected for the purposes of:

  * Recording transactions on your account
  * The management of your account
  * Security (including customer identification)
  * Customer Profiling
  * Customer relationship management and marketing



Where contact with our offices is made by telephone, we record all conversations for security purposes. These recordings are the property of BetVictor and are not made available to any third party except any arbitration service to which we subscribe.

**Opting in and out of Promotional Communications**

Upon opening your account you will be given the option to Opt-in to any promotional communications. If at anytime you wish to change this request you can do so by emailing [help@betvictor.com](mailto:help@betvictor.com), putting your request in writing to BetVictor, Leanse Place, 50 Town Range, Gibraltar or by simply going to 'My Account' then 'Settings' and tick or untick the relevant boxes. Please note, when opting out, whilst every endeavour will be made to ensure you do not receive any further communication, please allow 28 days for this request to be processed.

**Changing your personal details**

It is your responsibility to input Your Contact Details correctly and notify BetVictor of any changes. You may update Your Contact Details from time to time through the "My Account" management page on the Website or by contacting Customer Services.

**International Transfers of Data**

It may in certain circumstances be illegal to transfer any personal data outside of the EEA. However, when using the internet to collect and transfer data, the exact path of data transmission is unknown and could therefore be transferred outside of this area.

**Disclosure to third parties**

From time to time we disclose data to third parties(these include but are not limited to our Licensing Bodies, Sporting Integrity Bodies, Security Verification Companies and Marketing Companies)for the purposes of direct mailing, emailing, database management and card processing and security checking or investigation on our behalf or for compliance with lawful requests. Where this is purely for statistical use/analysis this disclosure does not include personal data. Other information is disclosed only to the extent required to enable the necessary functions to be undertaken. We remain responsible for the actions of third parties to whom we disclose data. For a full list of third parties we may disclose your information to please contact [help@betvictor.com](mailto:help@betvictor.com).

To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you against appropriate third party databases. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information.  This is done to confirm your identity, a credit check is not performed and your credit rating will be unaffected

**The security and accuracy of your data**

All of the data collected is stored in a secure and protected environment and is correct as it is provided. You are entitled by law to have a copy of the data recorded (subject to a £10 administration charge) and to have any errors corrected. All reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that any processing of your data will adhere to the strictest standards of security and accuracy. Disclosure of your personal data will only take place in accordance with applicable laws. Such disclosure will primarily be to other BetVictor companies, BetVictor business partners and consultants, and suppliers (e.g. card processing organisations) that are engaged to carry out financial or other processing on our behalf. It is not our policy to sell your information to any third party.

In order to comply with our legal and regulatory requirements, personal data will not be kept for longer than is necessary (generally not more than six years after the closure of your account).  All such information will be held in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Account transactions**

Our analysis of the transactions that are recorded in your account is primarily for the purposes of:

  * Identification of promotional or targeted communications that we believe would be of interest to you
  * Trading and operational security
