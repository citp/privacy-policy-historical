The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices of official Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) web pages (defined as Institutional Web Pages in the [**VCU Web Publishing Guidelines**](https://web.archive.org/web/20021208175426id_/http%3A//www.vcu.edu/guidelines/index.html)) and is in accordance with the following statement.
