        <p>If you visit a Vancouver Film School website to browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about the visit. The following information is automatically collected and stored:</p>
        <ul class="footnote">
          <li>The Internet Protocol address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider;</li>

          <li>The date and time of the visit; and</li>
          <li>The web pages or services accessed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Information collected automatically in this manner is used for purposes such as assessing system performance, improving web services, improving website management and determining best content for our visitors.

      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Information collected directly from you</h3>
        <p>All personal information held or collected by Vancouver Film School is protected under the federal <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/P-21">Privacy Act</a>. This means that at any point of collection you will be asked for consent to collect your information, and you will be informed of the purpose for which it is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>What safeguards are in place?</h3>
        <p>Vancouver Film School makes reasonable security arrangements to protect your personal information against such risks as unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, or disposal. Security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operating practices as part of Vancouver Film School's continuing commitment to the protection of personal information it holds. Consumer inquiries will be forwarded to the appropriate Vancouver Film School staff by email, and we will make every effort to ensure the security of these transmissions.

      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Disclosure of third party services</h3>
        <p>Any message that you may send through our sites will go through Rackspace, a third party corporation responsible for handling the day-to-day web servers for our company.
