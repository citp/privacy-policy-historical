**Collection and Use of Information.**

VF, itself or through its third party providers, collects on this website information that you voluntarily provide along with certain automatically collected information such as your IP address and cookies.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic and geographic information, which may assist in the delivery of content, identifying preferences and site usage statistics.

We use cookies, when needed, to deliver content specific to your interests and when applicable to save your password or sign up information so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. You may set your browser to refuse cookies. If you make that choice, please understand that you may experience diminished functionality and content delivery. Additionally you may not be eligible for any specials and / or promotions we may offer our websites users.

Your Personal Information will not be sold, rented, shared, disseminated or otherwise disclosed except as described in this Privacy Policy or if disclosure is required by law.

We may share your information with the VF Corporation family of brands (including, for example, The North Face®, Vans®, Timberland®, Dickies®, Kipling®, and Jansport®) and may also receive information about you from other brands held by VF Corporation.

We use third-party companies to provide Internet data hosting and to help us measure and determine how visitors use our website and the effectiveness of our website and promotions in order to help us improve and optimize our website and the products and services we offer.

Data security is important to VF and we have instituted security procedures and measures to protect our servers and networks that store personal information. Unfortunately, no transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and, therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information.
