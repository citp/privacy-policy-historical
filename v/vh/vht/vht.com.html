<p><span>Your privacy is very important to VHT. With that in mind, we have established and implemented information handling practices for www.VHT.com that we believe are consistent with the highest standards and best practices of organizations doing business on the Internet. This privacy policy describes the practices that apply to our site, including the information we collect about you, when and how we collect that information and what may happen to that information. We have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about our practices so that you can make an informed decision about the extent of your use of our site. </span><br><br><strong>Simply put: </strong><br><span>We will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties unless you have specifically authorized us to do so. </span><br><br><span>We will allow you to view, correct or remove your personal information and other information associated with your registration as a user of our services; and we will take reasonable steps to protect the security of the personal information we collect from you. </span><br><br><span>The remainder of this policy describes our information handling practices in detail. </span><br><br><strong>When You Are Just Visiting Us</strong><br><span>You can always visit our site without revealing who you are or providing any personal information. When you visit our site or visit our site through one of our partner's sites, we do collect usage information, but it is anonymous and is not linked to you as an individual. We use session data to better understand things like how our site is navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, the length and frequency of stays at our site, the variety of searches of our site's database, the types of browsers and computer operating systems used by our visitors and the Internet Protocol addresses from which our visitors connect to our site. We use this information to improve our site content and ease of use. </span><br><br><strong>Cookies </strong><br><span>We may place a "cookie" on your personal computer. A cookie is a small computer file that our computer sends to your computer and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our site. Cookies help us recognize you when you visit our site again. We use cookies on our site to collect session data for several purposes to personalize and improve your individual viewing experiences on our site. For example, we use cookies to keep track of your use of our site, gather data to improve the content of our site, provide information that may be of interest to you and improve the security of your experience with us. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our site that are available to the general public, but you will not be able to view some information on our site, use some features designed to enhance your experience at our site or access many of the services offered at our site. </span><br><br><span>We DO NOT have third party advertisers on our site. Therefore, there will be no advertisers using cookies and pixel tags to track session data about the ads you have seen and types of things that you appear interested in. </span><br><br><strong>Personal Information </strong><br><span>If you decide to order products and services from us, we will collect personal information about you that you voluntarily share with us. We collect personal information that is necessary for us to provide you with the services offered on our site. As mentioned, this personal information includes things like your name, email and mailing address and telephone number. </span><br><br><strong>Opt-out </strong><br><span>As part of the registration process, we give you two important choices about advertisements, updates and promotions. We will use the information you tell us about your preferences to share customized advertisements, updates and promotions. You can also elect not to receive information on specials, promotions, contests, sweepstakes and other opportunities available on our site; and/or our newsletters highlighting your customer broker programs and specials, promotions, contests, sweepstakes and other opportunities available on our site. If you do not opt-out from receiving these communications about our site, we will send them to you. Of course, if you do not opt-out during registration, but later change your mind, you can visit us online or call us to tell us that you would like to "opt-out" of and stop receiving either or both of these communications. </span><br><br><strong>Online Surveys and Contests </strong><br><span>We value your comments and opinions. From time to time, we will invite you, to participate in online surveys. Each time you purchase a product or service from us, we will ask for your feedback on your experience. Your participation in these surveys is on an anonymous basis, unless you elect to include your name. </span><br><br><strong>Payment Information and Purchase History.</strong> <br><span>After registering with us, you will be able to order products and services through our site or easily by phone or email. To do so, we will need to have payment information on file - for example, your credit card specifics like card number, issuing bank, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address. We will add this payment information to your Client Profile. We will keep a history of all your purchases of products and services for each particular property unless you choose to edit your Client Profile as described below in this policy (Changing and Removing Personal Information and Other Information). </span><br><br><strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong><br><span>Other than as explained in this policy, we will not disclose any personal information we collect from you to others without your permission, except in certain limited circumstances: (a) to protect the security of our site and our rights under our Terms and Conditions of Use; (b) to protect ourselves against liability; (c) in response to legal process, (d) if we believe in good faith that the law requires it; or (e) in connection with a sale of our business or company. Please note that if we receive a formal request to disclose your personal information in connection with a legal action, we will attempt to tell you about it at least ten (10) days before we respond to that request, if permitted by law, via the email address you provided. </span><br><br><strong>Changing and Removing Personal Information and Other Information... </strong><br><span>We are committed to giving you control over your personal information. You can change any of the personal information or other information in your Client Profile, by calling us at 800-790-TOUR. If at any time you want to view the personal information or other information in your Client Profile, your personal information changes, you want to change the preferences associated with your account, or would like us to remove some or all of the personal information or other information stored in your Client Profile, you can correct, update, or remove the information and preferences you have shared with us by calling us at 800-790-TOUR. If you request that we remove all of the personal information and other information stored in your Client Profile, then we will promptly do so. If we remove your personal information you will not be able to use the services available on our site unless you re-register. Similarly, we will remove all of your purchase records within six (6) months after receiving a request to do so. This six (6) month period is necessary to ensure that purchase arrangements made are properly accounted for. We may not be able to honor your request to remove your personal information if we are legally obligated to retain that information or those records. You will not have the ability to view, change or remove session data or information that we have gathered from third parties from your Client Profile. </span><br><br><strong>Notification of Changes </strong><br><span>We may change this policy from time to time.
