### Information We Collect

If you contact us or sign up for VHS newsletters, webinars, courses, or other offerings we will collect the information you submit to us, whether through an online form, email, or other communication.

We may also use "cookies" to track when you have returned to a specific page. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We may use cookies to help us understand the products and pages that interest you, personalize your experience on our website, and recall your specific information such as personal information, billing addresses, and so on to simply the process of recording your information on subsequent visits.

Beyond that, the only information about your visit that we receive is the standard Internet log information collected by all websites. This includes the host system from which your visit originated and the time and duration of your visits to our pages. No personally identifiable information is collected about you in this process, and the log information is combined with all other visits to create traffic statistics. Such statistics help organizations know overall traffic levels to their website.

### How We Use Information

If you contact us directly, we will respond to your request or take other suitable action. The information regarding your contact remains within VHS and VHS will not share, sell, or trade any personally identifiable information to any third party.

We collect and use your personal information to operate the VHS website and deliver the services you have requested.

In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. Such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to VHS, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

We may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from VHS and our affiliates. We may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services. We may also, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.

You may choose not to receive marketing or promotional emails from VHS, by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of the emails we send you. Additionally, you may unsubscribe by contacting us directly by phone or mail.

Our work, including our web statistics, is not automatically available to the government or to the public, and any information we choose to share will be on an aggregated, non-identifying basis.

We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on VHS Inc. or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of VHS; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of VHS services, or the public.

### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.
