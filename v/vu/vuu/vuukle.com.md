  2. We provide a sentiment solution, popularly known as WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? that can be easily placed anywhere on the page to help users express their sentiment towards the article they just read. It helps the publisher understand how many people felt happy, sad or angry for that article.
  3. We also provide commenting solutions that is placed at the bottom of the article to build community engagement where users are allowed to express their opinion relating to the article by maintaining decent conversations.

Whom we share your data with

Vuukle automatically stores your data when data subject visits or comments or interacts on publisher sites powered by Vuukle technologies. In this case the data is shared with that publisher only who becomes responsible to maintain its own privacy policy as per GDPR EU law which came into effect on 25th May 2018.

For example: Vuukle will share data with website XYZ of only those users who commented on website XYZ. If 5000 websites across the globe use Vuukle platform we will not share your data to all those 5000 sites. Only and only to those publishers where the respective user has engaged.

Vuukle does not share any kind of user data with any ad networks. We do not sell your data to any one. We only collect just the minimum data required in order to serve you better.

For how long we store your data

The user data stored by Vuukle exists with Vuukle for as long as the user has their profiles maintained with us. The data will be deleted whenever a user decides to delete his/her profile over which user has complete control.

How you can delete your data

Right to be forgotten

To delete any data stored with the respective publishers powered by Vuukle, Vuukle will forward your query to the publisher for deletion and we expect everyone to follow the rules and guidelines. Vuukle will not be liable whether the data has been deleted or not by the publisher on their end as GDPR EU law equally applies to the publisher.

If the user decides to come back again they will have to create a fresh profile like a new user.

Children's policy

Services provided by Vuukle are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. Since Vuukle does not collect any data on age we do not know if a person who has created an account is under the age of 13 or not. In case we learn or is notified that a certain profile is under the age of 13, Vuukle will delete it. If parents have any information regarding the same they can contact us for deletion.

Third party or publicly available sources

When a user logs in into our system for commenting from various social networks like Facebook connect, google or twitter your account is automatically linked to Vuukle commenting services. In such cases we collect users personal data on only three parameters that is name of the user, email of the user and avatar of the user. The user can later customise their avatar by managing their profile page on Vuukle. Also, the deletion policy will apply as narrated above.
