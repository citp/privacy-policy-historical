# Privacy Policy - Vungle

## Vungle Inc.’s Privacy Policy

**EFFECTIVE DATE: June 18, 2014**

Vungle, Inc. (“Vungle,” “we” or “us”) understands the importance of privacy. Vungle operates a mobile ad network (the “Ad Network” or the “Services”) through which Vungle displays targeted, contextual ads. Our clients are “Advertisers” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Ad Network, and “Publishers” that want to display ads to “end users” of their mobile apps. In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain from end users in connection with the Vungle Ad Network. 

**What Information Do We Collect and Why?**  
We do not collect name, email address or contact information from end users. However, in order to operate the Vungle Mobile Ad Network and to display ads to end users we may automatically collect certain information from end users within a single mobile application, including: 

    * IP Address, Android ID, MAC Address, IFA, UDID, and other unique identifiers;
    * Activities and page views within a single mobile application; and
    * Language information, device make and model, device connection, height and width of device, device volume, time zone and city, state-level location information, and operating system type, name, and version.



We use various tracking technologies to collect this information, such as pixel tags, pixel impression trackers from services such as Doubleclick, and other mobile tracking technologies. We may also receive a list of unique identifiers from Publishers and Advertisers, which we may use to determine to what end users to display (or not display) certain ads. 

We may also collect email, contact, payment and related information from our customers. 

**How We Use Your Information**  
We use the information that we gather in order to operate the Vungle Ad Network, including: 

    * To display ads to end users, to customize the ads we display to end users and to optimize the display of video ads;
    * For performance tracking and frequency capping, such as tracking views of ads, as well as clickthroughs and installs of apps that have been advertised;
    * For billing purposes;
    * To provide aggregate reports to Publishers and Advertisers; and
    * To improve our Services and for other research and analytical purposes; and
    * To send our customers marketing and promotional information; we do not send such communications to our customer’s end users.



**How We Share Your Information**  
We may share the information that we collect about end users as follows:

    * **Publishers and Advertisers.** We may share aggregate information with Publishers and Advertisers about the advertising displayed to end users and the success of ad campaigns. For Ads delivered by the Vungle Exchange, we may share device attributes in order for Advertisers to successful deliver an ad opportunity.
    * **Service Providers.** We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf.
    * **In Response to Legal Process.** We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
    * **To Protect Us and Others.** We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which Vungle is involved.
    * **Aggregate and De-Identified Information.** We may share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.



**Third-Party Links**  
Ads within the Vungle Ad Network may contain links to third-party websites and mobile apps. Any access to and use of such linked websites or mobile apps is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties. 

**How Can I Opt Out of Behavioral Targeting?**  
If you’d like to opt-out from having this information used to tailor advertising to you, please follow the instructions provided below. Note, we do not collect your name, email address, contact information, or other personally identifiable information. 

Once you’ve opted out, we will no longer use information about your activities to deliver behaviorally targeted advertising to your device. You will continue to receive advertising after you opt-out, but it may not be tailored to your interests. 

Depending on the type of device you have, you will need to either change settings on the device or submit your Device ID to us as noted below.

_Opting out on iOS devices such as iPhones, iPads or iPods_  
If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of interest-based advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON.’ You can do this by going to your **Settings** , and clicking on ‘ **Privacy** ,’ then ‘ **Advertising** ,’ and then turning the ‘ **Limit Ad Tracking** ’ setting to ‘ **ON**.’ Our system is designed to respect your choice and not use information to provide interest-based advertising when this setting is ON. 

_Opting Out on Android Devices_  
If you have an Android device and would like to opt out of our interest-based advertising, you can do so by entering your phone’s Android ID by going to your **Settings** , and under the Accounts section click on “Google” then click on “Ads” and then click on the ‘Opt out of interest-based ads’ 

**How Can I Unsubscribe from Marketing Emails?**  
We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to our customers (but not their end users). Customers may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail, or by emailing us at [unsubscribe@vungle.com](mailto:unsubscribe@vungle.com). Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you transactional e-mails about your account or any services you have subscribed to. 

**What about COPPA?**  
We are not responsible for the information practices of our Publisher clients. Publishers are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information. 

Unique identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) are the only “personal information” under COPPA that Vungle collects from end users. Vungle only uses the unique identifiers (and other associated information) it collects from end users to support its internal operations. 

**Security**  
We have implemented technical and administrative security measures to safeguard the information we collect from end users. 

**Contact Us**  
If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our Services or would like to make a complaint, please contact at [marketing@vungle.com](mailto:marketing@vungle.com). 

**Changes to this Policy**  
This Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above. We may change this Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Policy on our Site, at <http://www.vungle.com/privacy>.
