##  Freedom of Information (FOI)

Under the Victorian Freedom of Information Act (1982), you have general rights to request information held by VU.

The Act has four main functions: 

  * to provide a general right of access to documents
  * to enable individuals to amend incorrect information about them held by government
  * to provide rights of appeal in relation to the previous two functions
  * to require agencies to publish certain details about themselves and their functions 



### Information about the University

We aim to create an open and accountable culture by providing easily accessible information about the University.

VU makes a variety of information and documents available to its stakeholders as part of normal administrative processes. Much of our information is readily available to the public on this website, and also upon request. [University policies](http://wcf.vu.edu.au/GovernancePolicy/) can also be viewed by the public.

The University Archives holds a collection of records that are not required for the day-to-day business of the University, but are still worthy of preservation. For enquiries about what records are held and how these can be accessed, you can [contact the Archivist](http://gpps.vu.edu.au/freedom/cid/9/parent/0/t/freedom).

### Public inquiries

The University endeavours to meet all reasonable requests for access to information through normal administrative arrangements.

However, the University has many documents that cannot be made available through routine requests.  Some of these documents may hold a special interest for researchers and historians and can be made available upon request, without the need to lodge a formal application.

[Read more about public inquiries](http://gpps.vu.edu.au/freedom/cid/13/parent/0/t/freedom), and get contact details for written requests.
