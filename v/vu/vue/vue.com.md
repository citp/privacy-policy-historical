### EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks

Consistent with our commitment to protect Personal Data worldwide we are dedicated to providing privacy protection as defined by the European community and Swiss laws for the handling of Personal Data received from individuals in the European Union member states (including Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (collectively the “EU member states” or the “EU”) and Switzerland. The Pearson VUE Business Group complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the EU member states and Switzerland to the United States.

We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal data from the EU member states and Switzerland.

## DESCRIPTION OF CERTIFICATION, LICENSURE, AND ACADEMIC ADMISSION TEST SERVICES

We provide testing services as a service provider under the instructions of and on behalf of our test sponsors (that act as an autonomous data controller) and we provide testing services on behalf of ourselves. The test sponsor is the company or organization that offers certification, licensure, or academic admission testing and controls the test(s) that must be taken to secure such certification, credentialing, licensure, or academic admission. We collect or receive Personal Data from certification, licensure, and academic admission testing candidates and from the test sponsor. The information we may collect or receive includes, but is not limited to, your test registration, incident resolution (such as fraud prevention), collection of payment for testing services you’ve requested, and your test results of such testing. We use Personal Data in order to perform the testing services related to the administration and delivery of certification, licensure, and academic admission testing on behalf of the test sponsor. Upon completion of your exam we may collect and score your test responses and then derive a test score and generate a report about your certification, credentialing, licensure, or academic admission test results. In most cases, as it is necessary to perform the services, such scoring will be completed through automated means based on the criteria provided by your test sponsor.

In the event that you submit a request for an accommodation for your certification, licensure or academic admission test, you may be asked to submit health information records in compliance with your test sponsor’s requirements, including but not limited to, documentation from your physician evidencing your need for the accommodations. We will work with the test sponsor to evaluate your eligibility for an accommodation and if an accommodation is granted we will implement an acceptable accommodation solution.

Providing your Personal Data is voluntary, but may be necessary if you wish to receive certification, licensure, or academic admission testing services. We will retain your Personal Data for as long as needed to provide our services and for such period of time as instructed by the test sponsor. To the extent that you request Pearson VUE to delete your Personal Data, it may affect our ability to allow you to register, schedule, and take a test administered and delivered by us on behalf of the test sponsor; or to provide to you any other products or services offered, and such deletion may affect your certification, licensure or academic admission status, dependent on the policy of your test sponsor.

In addition to the Personal Data that we may collect or receive in registering a candidate (“you”) for certification, licensure, or academic admission testing the test sponsor may also provide to us or instruct us to collect the following additional Personal Data, as necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to: language, date of birth, social security number, test sponsor’s identification number, employment information, previous examination history, education information, and source of financing for the test. For candidate verification and identification purposes, we may be instructed to collect all or part of a government-issued identification number and mother’s maiden name.

At the test center, depending upon the test sponsor and/or test security requirements, you may be required to provide your signature, photographic image, a copy of your photo identification, palm vein pattern digitally where permitted by law (for the purposes of identity verification and to protect the security and integrity of the test) and you may be audio- and video-recorded while you are taking the test. You may be required to provide your palm vein pattern where permitted by law if your ID does not meet the requirements of identity verification. Where palm vein pattern collection is required by your test sponsor, by continuing with the test, you are consenting to such collection and use.

We will handle and treat all Personal Data collected or received by us in connection with certification, licensure, and academic admission test registration and test administration in the manner as described in this Privacy Policy.

### How We Use the Personal Data We Collect.

We use Personal Data to provide services and information, to administer testing programs on behalf of your test sponsor, and for our legitimate purposes in operating our business. Examples of our use or disclosure of your Personal Data include, but is not limited to:

  * We will use your Personal Data to provide test delivery services to you, including test scheduling and administration, maintaining the integrity of the testing process, and score reporting as directed by your test sponsor. Where required by your test sponsor and permitted by law, your palm vein pattern will be used as described herein and also to verify your identity detect, and aide in the prevention of fraud or misrepresentation.
  * Personal Data is also used for our legitimate business purposes as needed to manage day to day business needs including, but not limited to, payment processing and financial account management, business planning and forecasting, security and fraud prevention, and compliance with legal and regulatory obligations.



### Independent Testing Centers

Certain certification, credentialing, licensure, and academic admission tests are administered through independent authorized testing centers. These authorized testing centers are required to use any data collected in compliance with this Privacy Policy. If you have unaddressed concerns about an independent testing center relating to certification, credentialing, licensure, or academic admission services provided by the Pearson VUE Business Group please contact us at [PearsonVUEContracts@pearson.com](mailto:PearsonVUEContracts@pearson.com) or you may call us at 1 (952) 681-3918.

## ONLINE PROCTORING TEST SERVICES

### Description of Online Proctoring Test Services

If a test sponsor offers their test outside of a Pearson VUE Business Group’s authorized testing center through online proctoring and if you choose to take the test through Pearson VUE’s online proctoring platform, in addition to the requirements of Description of Certification, Licensure, and Academic Admission Test Services, you will be monitored over the Internet through your computer via your webcam and microphone. Online proctoring means that you will log on to a test platform through the internet to take your test and you will be monitored during your entire testing session in real-time so that your face, voice, desk and workspace will be captured and a recording will be made of these images for the purposes of test security and the integrity of the testing process. It is your responsibility to monitor your online proctored testing environment. You must make sure that only you will be recorded during your testing session and that no one else will be physically in the room where you are testing and that no one speaks to you during your testing session. If at any time during an online proctored testing session another person enters the work space or if another person’s voice is detected on the audio recording your testing session may be immediately terminated and the test stopped. If this event occurs you will not receive a test refund or be credited for any portion of the test fee.

Some test sponsors’ may elect to utilize self-check-in automated greet process during online proctor testing. This process will include identification validation through automated processing and facial comparison technology. You understand and agree that Pearson VUE may, for some test sponsor’s, use facial comparison technology for the purpose of verifying your identity during the testing session by comparing your facial image to that presented on your identification and to facial images captured during the testing session and for the purposes of further developing, upgrading, and improving this application.

The video and audio recordings are standard test procedures for all test sponsors’ online proctored tests and your video and audio recording will be used for purposes of identity verification, remote observation, incident resolution, such as fraud prevention, test security, and for the integrity of the test and the testing process. For more information about how the test sponsor may collect and use your Personal Data we encourage you to review the test sponsor’s privacy policy.

### Personal Data Collected for Online Proctoring Test Services

All of the same Personal Data that we collect or receive as described above applies to you when you register to take a test sponsor’s online proctored test. Prior to the start of your online proctored test you may be required to hold up your ID documentation, (for example your driver license, passport or other approved ID that the test sponsor designates), to be recorded on the video for the purpose of identity verification. The collection of such data is optional, but necessary if you choose to use the online proctoring function. You understand that the audio- and video-tapes of your testing session will be supplied to the relevant test sponsor and any of their appointed agents to assist with their management of your test.
