This privacy statement sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

In each case, we will store your personal data only as long as we need in order to provide the information, services or offers you requested or to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts.
