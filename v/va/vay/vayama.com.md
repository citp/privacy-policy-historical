 **The information we collect**

From you.  We receive and store information that you submit on our website or give us in other ways (such as via telephone or through the mail). This consists of information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, date of birth, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences (such as meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options) as well as your entertainment interests (such as tour itineraries, performance and activity interests, and venue preferences). You can choose not to provide information to us, but generally this information is necessary for you to register as a user, make bookings for travel or entertainment, complete a profile, receive updates of flight delays or schedule changes, post reviews, contribute to a discussion forum, participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes, ask us a question, or initiate other transactions on our website. If you decline to supply or provide us with information while using our website, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of its features.

About Travel Companions. When you make a reservation on behalf of one or more travel or activity companions using our website, we will request personal information as well as interests, styles and preferences for each of those individuals. You should obtain the consent of those individuals prior to submitting such information, as access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.

As May Be Required By Law.  Under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight program, most air passengers are now required to provide their full name, date of birth, and gender (plus redress number, when applicable). Secure Flight is a federally mandated program administered by the TSA. The privacy notice of the TSA is as follows:>

_The Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires aircraft operators to collect information from you for purposes of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Providing this information is voluntary; however, if it is not provided, you may be subject to additional screening or denied transport or authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA Privacy policies, or to view the system of records notice and the privacy impact assessment, please see TSA's Web site at[ **www.tsa.gov**](http://www.tsa.gov/)._

From Other Sources. From time to time we may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from our affiliated entities, business partners or other third party sources and add it to our account information about you. Examples of such information include updated address information, purchase history, and demographic data. In addition, if you sign up for Vayama.com using your social media account, link your Vayama.com account to your social media account, or use certain other Vayama.com social media features, we may access information about you through that social media provider, subject to that provider's policies. The information may include your name, email address, profile picture, gender, list of friends, and other information that you authorize us to receive. Depending on the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations ("Location Data") or "likes" in order to provide you with relevant content. Note that your Location Data may also be shared with your friends on a social media provider, subject to your privacy settings with that social media provider.

Similarly, if we send you an email about Paris travel and you show interest in Paris hotels by clicking on a link about Paris hotels in the email, we may send you an email containing special hotel offers in Paris or other destination information such as tours and local entertainment. We hope such emails provide valuable information to you about travel-related or other special offers available on our website. Note, however, that you may choose not to receive these emails.

**Display of tailored advertising and your choices**

Data collected by us to serve you with relevant advertising. We want to help provide you with relevant content and other information as you use the Internet. To do this, we may, through **Cookies and other technologies**, collect and store information about your travel-related or other searches, such as prospective itineraries, airfare information or entertainment bookings in which you indicate interest. We use this information, together with other information we have collected about you, to serve you with ads, on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. For example, if you search for a flight to Shanghai on our website, you may see an advertisement for a Shanghai travel package on our website or on another website you visit. We do not combine information we collect about your travel-related or other searches with personal information (such as your email address) in order to serve you with advertisements nor do we share your personal information with third parties so that they can serve you with advertisements.

If you wish to opt-out of this kind of advertising, you can either delete cookies on your browser or you can click on the following link: [**http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Note that if you choose not to receive tailored ads, you will still see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.

Data collected by others to serve you with relevant advertising.  The advertisements you see on our website are served by us or by our service providers. However, we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through **Cookies and other technologies**. These third parties include (1) Google, which provides us with analytics data, displays advertisements for third party products and services on our website, and collects information when you view or interact with such advertisements,(2) our other business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our website, and (3) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with an advertisement they place on websites across the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences, and to display advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests on our website and across the Internet. The information they collect does not include your personal information.

Note that we do not have access to or control over **Cookies and other technologies** these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

Data collected by cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising. Like other companies operating online, Vayama.com participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through **Cookies and other technologies** and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel or entertainment). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any personal information about you on our website. Please click [**here**](http://www.bluekai.com/consumers.html) to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation in these programs.

  


**How we protect your information**

We want you to feel secure and confident about using our website to make travel arrangements and other bookings, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect about you. While no website can guarantee security or that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may only do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.

  


**A warning about phishing**

We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, login name, or password, in an unsecure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.
