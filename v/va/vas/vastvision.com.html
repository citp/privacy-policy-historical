    <h3>The Information We Collect </h3>
      <p>Payment  Information: If you establish a credit account with us or our providers or if  you purchase a service from VastVision.com, we may collect additional  information, including billing information, credit card numbers and expiration  dates and tracking information from caches or money orders <br>

We do not sell, rent, trade or  exchange any personally-identifying information of our Users. We may provide  your Collected Information to our affiliates and service providers under  contract (such as customer care) to support the operation of the Site and our  services. We may share certain aggregate information based on analysis of  Collected Information with our partners, customers, advertisers or potential  Users. We may use your Collected Information to execute marketing campaigns,  promotions or advertising messages on behalf of third parties; however, in  these circumstances, your Collected Information will not be disclosed to such  third parties unless you respond to the marketing, promotion or advertising  message. Your Collected Information may be transferred, stored, used and  processed outside your home jurisdiction. In case of a merger with or transfer  of business to another business entity, we will transfer your Collected  Information to the entity which acquires the business (Should such a  combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this  Privacy Policy with respect to your Collected Information). <br>
      Publishing  Information: All of your Publishing Information will be publicly available on  the Site and therefore accessible by any internet user. Any Publishing  Information that you disclose to VastVision.com becomes public information and  you relinquish any proprietary rights (including but not limited to the rights  of confidentiality and copyrights) in such information. You should exercise  caution when deciding to include personal or proprietary information in the  Publishing Information that you submit to us. <br>
      Payment  Information: VastVision.com will share your Payment Information with banks or  vendors relevant to the transaction in order to enable transactions to be  completed. In addition, VastVision.com may use Payment Information to determine  your credit-worthiness and, in the process of such determination, VastVision.com  may make such Payment Information available to banks or credit agencies. Any  credit card information that you provide through the Site is directly submitted  to a payment server of the credit card processing bank. VastVision.com does not  maintain electronic or physical copies of your credit card information. While VastVision.com  has in place up-to-date technology and internal procedures to guard your  Payment Information against intruders, there is no guarantee that such  technology or procedure can eliminate all of the risks of theft, loss or  miss-use. VastVision.com shall not be liable to you or any other person for any  damages that might result from unauthorized use, publication, disclosure or any  other miss-use of Payment Information, including credit card information.<br>
      Statistical  Information: We use Statistical Information to help diagnose problems with and  maintain our computer servers, to manage our Site, and to enhance our Site and  services based on the usage pattern data we receive. We may generate reports  and analysis based on the Statistical Information for internal analysis,  monitoring and marketing decisions. We may provide Statistical Information to  third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide personally-identifying  information without your permission.</p>
  <h3>Disclosure of Information </h3>
      <p>We  reserve the right to disclose your Collected Information to relevant authorities  where we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify,  contact or bring legal action against someone who may be infringing or  threatening to infringe, or who may otherwise be causing injury to or  interference with, the title, rights, interests or property of VastVision.com,  our Users, customers, partners, other web site users or anyone else who could  be harmed by such activities.<br>
      We  also reserve the right to disclose Collected Information in response to a  subpoena or other judicial order or when we reasonably believe that such  disclosure is required by law, regulation or administrative order of any court,  governmental or regulatory authority.<br>
