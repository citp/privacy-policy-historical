## Vault Data Security and Privacy Policy

Vault is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all of our users while offering the highest quality educational material to them. Because we gather certain types of information about and from users so that we can fulfill your requests and better serve your needs, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of this information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how to correct or change it, and what steps we take to safeguard personal information provided to us both online and offline.

This Data Security and Privacy Policy is effective as of our last updated date of May 22, 2018 for all users to coincide with the enhanced data protection rights required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes, but is not limited to, the "EEA Resident Rights" section added below.

**What Information Do We Collect About You?**

You can visit our online products without giving us any personally identifiable information. However, for many of our products we request and collect information about you in certain circumstances so that we can provide our users with the most efficient, enhanced, and personalized service.

**Information Users Volunteer**

We collect personally identifiable information such as names, mailing addresses, and/or email addresses when you create an optional user account through our online products. Our registration forms will indicate what information is required and what information (if any) is optional. Users may opt to receive email updates, newsletters, and job alerts, as well as emails from selected Vault partners.

When you fill out registration forms, submit your resume, or provide us with other personal information, we collect that information for processing and use in accordance with this Policy. The options you have to provide us with personal information may change, but here are some examples of situations in which you will have the opportunity to provide personal information to us:

  * Creating an account
  * Signing up for email alerts
  * Completing a form related to one of our products or services
  * Uploading a resume
  * Filling out a profile
  * Contacting us for technical support or customer service



Your saved profile can be viewed by prospective employers and recruiters if that option is selected for your account.

We also collect and store certain information associated with actions you take. For example, we store information about the job postings you apply to.

If you connect to the Platform using Facebook, Google+, or another social networking site (each a "Social Networking Site"), we will receive information that you authorize the Social Networking Site to share with us, which may include public profile information, email address, and locale. When we receive this information, it becomes Vault account information for purposes of your use of the Platform. This information also constitutes personal information and is therefore subject to this Policy. Any information that we collect from your Social Networking Site account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the Social Networking Site, so please consult the Social Networking Site's privacy and data practices. You have the ability to disconnect your Social Networking Site account from your Vault account by adapting the privacy settings in your Social Networking Site account. If you come to the Platform through a Social Networking Site, from other websites or with devices that enable third parties to collect information from or about you, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies. 

**Information Collected Automatically**

We also may collect your IP address, browser type, access times and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our website. In addition, we may use cookies to track usage patterns at our site. See below for more detail on cookies.

**What Do We Do With Collected Information?**

We use information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve our products. We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, personalized content to our website visitors and to send newsletters, mail, emails, features, surveys or other updates to our users. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, fulfill customer requests, respond to any problems that may arise (such as delivery issues, difficulties in navigating our sites or accessing certain features), as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users. 

**How Do We Share Personal Information?**

Personal information is available to Vault and its technical and fulfillment agents and consultants who make our websites and our products and services available to you. Vault sub-contractors do not have access to protected user data. They perform all operations on an offline development system with sample data.

**Vault and Its Agents**

All companies working for Vault must comply with our information collection, use and disclosure policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to third parties or to use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law. All Vault agents are provided with training on federal and state laws governing confidentiality of user data. 

We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation.

**How Do We Use Cookies?**

Your Web browser offers so-called "cookies" which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best. Cookies also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser and our websites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some features or offerings will not be available to you.

**How We Work with Third-Party Partners**

Vault works with third parties, such as DoubleClick for Publishers, to provide you with personalized, interest-based advertising. Vault also works with Google Analytics, to provide analytics services that use the Cookies set on your device to measure the performance of advertising and track traffic to Vault generally. We have also implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, which categorizes Cookie information so that we and third-party service providers can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on the Platform and various websites across the internet.

For more information about how Google uses data from sites that use their services, see <https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites>

We work with AddThis, a third party, to provide sharing tools and analytics services. AddThis uses Cookies. To learn more about AddThis's privacy policy and opt-out options, see <http://www.addthis.com/privacy> and <http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out>.

You are also able to opt out of other third-party advertiser and ad network placement of Cookies or targeted advertising generally by visiting the following links: [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/); [Digital Advertising Alliance; European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (for users in the EU); or [The Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/choices) (for users in Canada);

**How Can You Control Your Personal Information?**

We believe that choice in how and when you are contacted is key to customer satisfaction, so we offer several ways for you to update your contact information or change your preferences. If you are a registered user at our websites, you will be able to log in and update or change your contact or account information. You may unsubscribe to any of our online email updates by following the unsubscribe instructions in the body of any message. You may write to us and update your contact information or ask that we not share your personal contact information with third parties at: Vault, c/o Privacy Coordinator, 132 West 31st Street, New York, NY 10001. In those instances, we will retain your information in a "do not promote" file in our database. You may also contact us at [support@Vault.com](mailto:support@vault.com "Vault Data Security and Privacy Policy"). We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your opt-out requests promptly.

**Security Of Your Personal Information**

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard industry practices internally and with our service providers suitable to the degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in this policy.

Your personal information will also be protected by the password you created when you registered at our website. The confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by following the instructions on the website. Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions cannot be assured. Vault employees are made aware of its privacy practices through periodic communications and training. We limit access to personal data only to those employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure and encrypted environments. To maintain the highest level of security, we conduct internal reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. When an agreement expires client data will be purged from our systems upon request from the institution.

Vault agrees to limit internal access to education records to those individuals that are determined to have legitimate educational interests.

**Potential Breach of Security**

Vault agrees to notify its clients in the event that customer data is accessed by any breach of security resulting in an unauthorized release of client data. Vault implements reasonable technical, physical and administrative safeguards to ensure the protection of personal information against unauthorized use or access.

**Network Monitoring**

Vault's network activity is continually monitored and tested by our staff and multiple service providers to improve product delivery and maintain scalability. These audits and reviews may trigger design changes and/or the deployment of new regional data centers to handle new or unusual client traffic.

**Parental Rights**

In compliance to the Children's Online Privacy Act (COPPA) and The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Vault will not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity. Parents can review their child's personal information, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information. Any such information will not be disclosed to third parties. Access to primary content and features is entirely possible with generic, non-specific user information.

**EEA Resident Rights**

If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us at [support@Vault.com](mailto:support@vault.com "Vault Data Security and Privacy Policy").

  
In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us at [support@Vault.com](mailto:support@vault.com "Vault Data Security and Privacy Policy").

  
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you. Registered users can manage their account settings and email marketing preferences.

Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

  
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

  
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to keep any information in our archives that we deem necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

**Changes To Our Privacy Policy**

We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy as necessary to protect our users and to comply with a changing environment. We recommend that you check the policy when you visit our site to be sure you are aware of and understand our current policy. If we make material changes to this policy or in how we will use or collect your personally identifiable information, we will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. We will not make material changes in how we handle previously collected personal information that have retroactive effect unless legally required to do so, and we will email registered website visitors information on material changes to this policy.
