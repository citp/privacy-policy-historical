		  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
Vantage Communications Ltd. respects your privacy. This statement of our Privacy Policy 
explains what information we gather from you and how we use that information. We 
consider the information you have shared with us strictly confidential and will 
use that information only as specified in this Privacy Policy or to the extent 
necessary to comply with applicable law. <br>
<br>
<b>Information We Gather and How We Use It</b><br>
<br>
We collect certain information from you in order to provide you with the best 
user experience possible. <br>
<br>
We use your IP address to identify you, to gather demographic information that 
helps us understand how you and our other customers use our Web site, and to 
administer our Web site. If you purchase items through the Marketplace, your IP 
address is used to help match you with your shopping cart. <br>
<br>
Our registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your 
name and email address), demographic information (like your postal/zip code, 
age, occupation and income level, etc.) and profile information (like your 
investment experience). We use your contact information to contact you about our 
Web site and provide you with information and promotional material from our 
partners and advertisers. We use various other portions of your information to 
comply with the Toronto Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock 
Market regulations regarding the distribution of real-time information, to 
target advertising, and to personalize our Web site by showing you content that 
we think you might be interested in and displaying the content according to your 
preferences. <br>
<br>
We sometimes conduct or sponsor surveys and contests on our Web site. If you 
elect to participate, we may ask you for contact, demographic and other 
information as part of these offerings. We would use this information to analyze 
and report on the results of surveys, to provide you with the results of the 
surveys and contests, and to send you information about our company and 
promotional material from our partners and advertisers. Participation in 
surveys, contests and e-blasts are completely voluntary. <br>
<br>
From time to time we may supplement information that you provide to us with 
information received from third parties. <br>
<br>
<b>Information We May Disclose</b><br>
<br>
We share demographic, profile and other general information about you and our 
other customers with our advertisers on an aggregate basis. This means that we 
tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics of our 
customer base such as how many female visitors and registered users we have 
within a certain postal code, but we do not specifically identify a particular 
female visitor or provide her contact information to our advertisers. <br>
<br>
Our advertisers may ask us to mail or e-mail you promotional information 
tailored to your interests. We will send you this information on behalf of our 
advertisers. From time to time we may use third parties (pursuant to a 
confidentiality agreement) to assist us in e-mail broadcasts and list 
management. You may opt-out of receiving these mailings by editing your account 
settings. <br>
<br>
We may disclose your contact information or other specific information about you 
to third parties in conjunction with advertising, contests or new service 
offerings that you elect to participate in. <br>
<br>
We may share your contact information with our strategic partners and certain 
other companies. These selected entities may send you information by e-mail or 
regular mail, or may contact you by telephone. <br>
<br>
We may from time to time sell or transfer your contact and demographic 
information to affiliates and non-affiliates of the Company. <br>
<br>
As we continually look for ways to improve our business, we may buy or sell a 
company. If we buy or sell a business, the names collected will likely be 
transferred as a part of the sale. Information about registrants will be used in 
the aggregate. However, if we buy a business, we will honour the requests that 
customers made of that business regarding e-mail communications. In the event 
that we sell a business, we will do everything in our power to ensure that the 
e-mail communications requests you made of us are honoured. <br>
<br>
We may release your contact and other information to third parties when we 
believe that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) 
cooperate with state and federal regulatory agency investigations, (iii) comply 
with the terms of the Subscriber Agreements with the TSX, Nasdaq and the New 
York Stock Exchange, (iv) enforce the terms of our User Agreement or License 
Agreement, or (v) protect the rights of Vantage Communications Ltd. or others.
