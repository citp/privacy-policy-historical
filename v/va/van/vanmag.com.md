Unless expressly prohibited from doing so under applicable legislation such as "anti-spam" legislation, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, to ensure compliance with our Terms of Use, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Canada Wide, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation to protect Canada Wide or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Sites. Information about our users, including personal information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of Canada Wide.

If you have submitted such information, including your personal information, you have chosen to disclose that personal information publicly. Please review our Terms of Use in respect of such situations.

## Updating, Correcting or Deleting Your Personal Information

If you have an online account with us, you may change any of your personal information in your account at any time. We encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may at any time ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed, or withdraw consent to receive commercial electronic messages from us. You may also contact us at the email or address listed below and request that we update, correct or delete any personal information we have collected, and we will endeavor to respond to your inquiry or to correct, update or remove the personal information you have provided us as you indicate. However, please note that in some cases, we may believe it is necessary or appropriate to retain certain personal information we have collected, and the deletion of such personal information will be in our discretion unless otherwise required by law. If you withdraw consent to receive any commercial electronic messages from us, we will promptly stop sending those messages to you. If you withdraw consent to any other use of your personal information, we will advise you of the implications (if any) of such withdrawal.

As an additional security measure we may "back up" the data stored on our systems. Data archived for back-up purposes at a given point in time may include information that you corrected or deleted after the back-up was made.

## Online Information Security

We have endeavored to put into place and maintain reasonable industry-recognized security measures in an effort to protect the security of your personal information. For example, if you have an online account, it is only accessible through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information, to the extent you obtain a password for access to the Sites or for use in connection with the Services, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Sites and Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused or misappropriated. We also require our partners and Service Providers to adopt and follow stringent consumer privacy policies and communications policies that are consistent with “no call”, “anti-spam” and other applicable legislation. You may choose to link to other third party sites from our Sites or mobile applications in which case you should be aware that we are not responsible for the third parties’ privacy practices or collection, use and disclosure of personal information. You should read the privacy polices of all third party sites before submitting any personal information to those sites.
