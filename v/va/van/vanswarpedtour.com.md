2\. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT 

When you register on this site, we may sell, share, or rent your personally identifiable information to others, including CCRLs members, sponsors, affiliates, and partners (the "CCRL Affiliated Parties"). However CCRL will not provide your personally identifiable information unless you have opted in to receive emails from the CCRL Affiliated Parties. CCRL restricts access to your nonpublic personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide information to you. CCRL maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information. 

CCRL uses Customer Information to enhance your use of the CCRL services by processing such information for various purposes, including providing information to you about CCRLs products and services, formatting and displaying elements of Contact Data and Message Data to you and to those whom you send messages, delivering advertisements and related links, storing your messages, and other purposes relating to offering you CCRL products and services. CCRL uses non-identifying and aggregate information to better design the Website and to share with advertisers and Festival-related affiliates and sponsors. CCRL also may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

CCRL may engage a third party to perform functions on CCRLs behalf, such as sending newsletters, sending requested postal mail and e-mail and SMS communications, analyzing and processing data, and providing customer service. CCRL requires that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but CCRL will not authorize them to use it for other purposes. For more information on third parties please see Section 7 Onward Transfer to Third Parties or click here. 

If CCRL desires to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, CCRL will offer you the opportunity to opt out of such use of your Personal Information for those other purposes. For more information on how to opt out please see Section 6 Choice/Opt Out or click here. 

3\. SURVEYS AND CONTESTS 

From time-to-time our Site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and therefore the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information may be shared with the contest or survey sponsors and may be used to notify the winners and award prizes. The terms of a contest may provide, among other things that the identities of the contest winners may be made public. Survey information may also be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Site. We may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests and they may use personally identifiable information for a secondary purpose. 

4\. PURCHASES OR ORDERS 

When you make purchases or conduct other business on on the Site, you will be directed to other sites where you will be asked to provide information on the purchase order form. When you are directed to a separate site that is CCRL owned site, the terms of this Privacy Policy apply. At any third party sites not owned by CCRL, we make no representations or warranties as to the privacy or protection of your personal information or the use thereof by such site.

6\. CHOICE/OPT OUT

OUR SITE IS NOT DIRECTED AT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 AND DO NOT KNOWINGLY COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13.

If CCRL receives actual knowledge that the site is being used by a child under the age of 13 CCRL will obtain Parental Consent before collecting, using, or disclosing the child's personal information. We obtain parental or guardian consent to collect information from a child under the age of 13 through the following process: 

A parent may email us at [info@aws.vanswarpedtour.com](mailto:%20info@aws.vanswarpedtour.com) to provide consent provided the email contains a digital signature, or other digital certificate that uses public key technology. Please put "Parental Consent for Child's Personal Information" in the subject line of the email. 

The collection and use of personal information collected from children will be disclosed and used in the same ways described above in this Policy. 

Our intention is not to disclose your information other than to our own employees and third party contractors who are bound by agreement with us to maintain the confidentiality of such information and who need the information in order for us to use the information as stated in this policy. 

Before allowing a child to use a service of on our Site that might result in the public disclosure of the child's information to third parties on the internet, we require a high level of verification to confirm that the parent has given permission for the child's participation in such services. We may require a parent to provide us with credit card information, speak to a trained telephone operator, or return by postal mail or fax a signed consent form. Parents have the option not to consent to the disclosure of their child's contact information to third parties.
