The personal data may for these purposes, be transferred internationally to affiliates of vanBasco.<br><br> Sometimes we invite visitors to submit names or e-mail addresses in connection with certain promotions, such as competitions or information on product updates. You may decide not to provide us with personal data which means you may be unable to participate in certain promotions, or receive product information, offered through the vanBasco website. If requested by you, we may use your personal data to contact you about offers or information on products and services of vanBasco or of other parties which you may be interested in. Any information relating to such products or services will be sent from vanBasco.

These include disclosure of personal data to the police, the government or third parties under certain circumstances. The nature of the Internet is such that the data may flow over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed and used by unauthorised persons who may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.<br><br> We can (and by registering with us, you authorise us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of crime, terrorism, fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or which we consider may expose us to legal liability.</p><p><b>Amendments to this Privacy Policy</b></p><p>The privacy policy statement as it appears on our site accurately reflects our position at this time. Based on your comments we may decide to improve the policy from time to time which will require an amendment to this statement. Future developments in the services which vanBasco offers and future developments in the law mean that vanBasco may need to amend its privacy policy.  In such cases, we will post an updated version of this privacy statement, which will become effective immediately upon its posting.</p><br><br></font></font></font></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
