                    <p>Virtual Business Solutions (VBS) wants its
                      members and customers to be happy with their purchases.
                      If, for any reason, you are unhappy with your purchase,
                      please contact VBS at 604-542-9664 for a RA (Return Authorization)
                      number to start the return process if eligible.</p>
                    <p>VBS will grant full refunds (less shipping and handling), 
                      for certain products returned to VBS in resalable condition 
                      within 30 days of the invoice date. All returns are subject 
                      to a 10 percent restocking fee. Return requests must be 
                      in writing and obtain an RA. Sale items and VAinsider Club 
                      Memberships are final sales and non-refund<font size="2"><span class="maintext">able.</span></font></p>
                    <p>You may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are 
                      levied once the package reaches your country. Additional 
                      charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have 
                      no control over these charges and cannot predict what they 
                      may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; 
                      you should contact your local customs office for further 
                      information. Additionally, when ordering from VBS, you are 
                      considered the importer of record and must comply with all 
                      laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving 
                      the goods.</p>
