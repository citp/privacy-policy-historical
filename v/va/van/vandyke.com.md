# Privacy

VanDyke Software does not sell, trade or give out customer information gathered from its Web site.

VanDyke Software publishes newsletters and product announcements via e-mail that customers may subscribe to on an "opt-in" basis. "Opt-in" means you must request a subscription. VanDyke Software will not send unsolicited e-mail. Information provided in the process of subscribing to these communications is used only to fulfill the subscription request. This information will not be sold, traded or shared with any third party.

Information provided on product order forms is used by VanDyke Software and Digibuy in processing orders. Please see the [Digibuy privacy page](http://www.digibuy.com/cgi-bin/privacy.html) for Digibuy's statement on how it uses customer information. VanDyke Software uses order information as follows: 

Order forms require users to give contact information (like their name and e-mail address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Customer contact information from the order form is used to communicate with customers about order status, and to verify identity during support and customer service requests. Financial information is used solely for the purpose of billing the user for products. 

Downloading VShell Server, SecureCRT, SecureFX, and Entunnel requires a street address, phone number and e-mail address. This is done to verify location as required by US export control regulations. Submitted information is checked in real time by CyberSource, a third party service that monitors order acceptance against a continually changing list of denied countries or persons and electronically verifies the customer's location. Names or company names and addresses of customers purchasing licenses for VShell Server, SecureCRT,SecureFX, and Entunnel outside the US and Canada must be reported to the Bureau of Export Administration. No other personal information is reported. 

If you have questions about the privacy policy, please [contact](https://web.archive.org/contact.html) us.
