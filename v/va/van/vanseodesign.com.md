# Privacy Policy | vanseodesign

Privacy and protecting the privacy of my clients is very important to me. My goal is to build a long lasting relationship with you that is based on mutual trust.

Naturally there are times where it's necessary to collect personal information such as your address, phone number, and email. I'll do everything I can to keep this information private and never sell your information for any reason. It bothers me when my own information is sold from one company to the next and I'll never do the same to anyone who trusts me with their's.

I have pruchased and maintain a secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate through Comodo to ensure that all credit card informtaion is encrypted when sent. The same encryption is used when logging in to access your billing and support details.

## Cookies

I have a few programs installed to help me run my business that will set cookies on your machine. These cookies are to maintain your secure connection when you log in as a client. They are temporary in nature and will expire when you close your browser.

I also use analytics software that sets cookies to track visits that give me information to improve the site. No personal information is collected through the use of these cookies.

The paragraphs that follow is the stuff to make the lawyers happy. It basically means I won't give out your information unless the police the government or someone else who really scares me insists I give it to them. And even then I'll fight it as best as I can.

## Disclosure of customer information and communications

Van SEO Design will not otherwise disclose its customers' personal and account information unless Van SEO Design has reason to believe that disclosing such information is legal and necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Van SEO Design, Van SEO Design's customers, or others, or where Van SEO Design has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

Van SEO Design also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Van SEO Design stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which Van SEO Design will disclose such electronic customer communications are when:

  1. It is necessary in order to provide service to the customer.
  2. It is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Van SEO Design and its customers.
  3. It is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, subpoenas, or other legal process that Van SEO Design determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable.
  4. It is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Van SEO Design and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.

I reserve the right to make changes to this policy as this site changes, but pledge to always maintain your privacy to the best of my ability.
