When you visit the Van Dyke’s Web site, in order for us to provide you with the products or services that you have requested, you may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information. For example, when you order a product, we will ask you to become a registered user of our site, during which you will be asked for your shipping and billing addresses, your email address, and your credit card number or other payment-related information. If you request one of our newsletters or send an inquiry to one of our customer service representatives, we will also store a record of your request along with your email address. In addition, our Web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as you computer’s IP address and which pages you visited, however that information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you.

**_How is the information being used?_**

The information we collect is used to provide the products and services that you have requested or that we think you might have an interest in. It is also used to improve the content of our Web site, to notify you of problems with your requests, or to update you about changes to our Web site.

If you are a registered user of the Web site, you can manage many aspects of your registration information. For security reasons, however, some parts of your personal information may not be changed online and may require you to call or write to us in order to verify your identity before such changes can be made.

_Security_

**_What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control?_**

Van Dyke’s values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process secure.

**_Secure Ordering Process_**

Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The Van Dyke’s Web site uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer. These browsers encrypt your credit card and personal information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept and misuse while being transmitted between your computer and our server. Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is insecure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.

Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end. We take appropriate precautions to protect the security and privacy of the information stored on our computer networks. Many of the systems which store your personal information are not connected to the Internet, reducing the likelihood of security breaches. Our systems are also housed in secure facilities, and access to your data by our employees is limited to a “need to know” basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for abuse. 

If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call Van Dyke’s at 1-800-787-3355. Our fax number for Customer Service is 1-605-796-4085 (for US/Canada 1-605-796-4425). Or, send your order to:

Van Dyke’s  
P.O. Box 278  
Woonsocket, SD 57385-0278 

If you have any further question regarding your online security, please contact us at 1-800-787-3355 or [e-mail Customer Service](mailto:restorers@cabelas.com).

**Children**

In accordance with federal law, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13 without the verifiable permission of a parent or guardian. If you are under age 13, you are welcome to browse our Web site. However you are not permitted to use any of the features of our site that require the collection of any personally identifiable information. If we determine that we have erroneously collected a child’s information, we will immediately undertake to delete that data from our records.
