1.      INTRODUCTION
Vantage FX Pty Ltd ACN 140 903 886 (referred to as Vantage, we, our, us) is bound by the Privacy
Act 1988 (Privacy Act), including the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and recognises the
importance of ensuring the confidentiality and security of your personal information.
To the extent that it is necessary to do so Vantage also complies with the requirements of the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as adopted by EU Member States. The AAPs and the
GDPR Policy share many common requirements. Where an obligation imposed by the AAPs and the
GDPR are the same, but the terminology is different, Vantage will comply with the terminology and
wording used in the AAPs, and this will constitute Vantage’s compliance with the equivalent
obligations in the GDPR.
If the GDPR imposes an obligation on Vantage that is not imposed by the APPs, or the GDPR
obligation is more onerous than the equivalent obligation in the APPs, Vantage will comply with the
GDPR.
All third parties (including clients, suppliers, sub-contractors, introducing brokers, or agents) that have
access to or use personal information collected and held by Vantage must abide by this Policy and
Collection Statement. Vantage makes this Policy and Collection Statement available free of charge
and can be downloaded from its website www.vantagefx.com
In this Policy and Collection Statement:
     • Disclosure of information means providing information to persons outside of Vantage;
     • Personal information means information or an opinion relating to an individual, which can be
        used to identify that individual;
     • Privacy Officer means the contact person within Vantage for questions or complaints
        regarding Vantage’s handling of personal information;
     • Sensitive information is personal information that includes information relating to a person's
        racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional or trade
        association membership, sexual preferences and criminal record, and also includes health
        information; and
     • Use of information means use of information within Vantage.
2.      WHAT KIND OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOLD?
We may collect and hold a range of personal information about you to provide you with our services,
including:
     • name;
     • address;

              o    trust deed;
     • any other information that is relevant to the services that we provide.
3.      HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
We generally collect personal information directly from you. For example, personal information will be
collected through our application processes, forms and other interactions with you in the course of
providing you with our products and services, including when you visit our website, use a mobile app
from us, call us or send us correspondence.
We may also collect personal information about you from a third party, such as electronic verification

also use third parties to analyse traffic at our website, which may involve the use of cookies.
Information collected through such analysis is anonymous.
We will not collect sensitive information about you without your consent unless an exemption in the
APPs applies. These exceptions include if the collection is required or authorised by law or necessary
to take appropriate action in relation to suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct.
If the personal information we request is not provided by you, we may not be able to provide you with
the benefit of our services, or meet your needs appropriately.

because it is impractical, and in some circumstances illegal, for Vantage to deal with individuals who
are not identified.

personal information we receive, unless it is relevant to our purposes for collecting personal

same way we hold your other personal information.

comply with the AML/CTF legislation.
9.     MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We recognise the importance of securing the personal information of our customers. We will take
steps to ensure your personal information is protected from misuse, interference or loss, and

       marketing; and
    • we provide a simple way of opting out of direct marketing; and
    • you have not requested to opt out of receiving direct marketing from us.
If we collect personal information about you from a third party, we will only use that information for the
purposes of direct marketing if you have consented (or it is impracticable to obtain your consent), and
we will provide a simple means by which you can easily request not to receive direct marketing
communications from us. We will draw your attention to the fact you may make such a request in our
direct marketing communications.

direct marketing, or for the purposes of facilitating direct marketing by other organisations. We must

reasonable steps to correct the information within 30 days, unless you agree otherwise. We do not
charge you for correcting the information.
