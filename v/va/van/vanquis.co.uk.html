                                            ^ Credit cards are not suitable for long-term borrowing or financing existing debt. Missing payments could have severe consequences and make obtaining credit more difficult.<br><br>* To build your credit rating and be considered for credit limit increases, use your card sensibly, stay within your credit limit and pay your monthly minimum payment on time. Not doing so could harm your credit rating and ability to obtain more credit. Please also keep your other accounts such as credit cards, loans, catalogues, mobile phone and mortgages in order and don't take on too much debt elsewhere. By using your credit limits and keeping your accounts in order, you demonstrate that you can manage your accounts well and can handle the monthly repayments. There are no guarantees, but if you follow these steps consistently every month, you should be on track to improving your credit history and building a strong credit rating. <br><br>Important: Credit is subject to: status; telephone contact; confirmation of name and address; not already holding a credit card issued by Vanquis Bank; no reasonable suspicion of fraud, and is only available to UK residents who are at least 18 years of age and are not legally restricted from obtaining credit e.g.because of bankruptcy.
