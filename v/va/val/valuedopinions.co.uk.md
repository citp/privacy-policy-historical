## **1\. Personal Data That May Be Collected About You**

We collect Personal Data in various ways described below. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Data, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Data when requested, you may not be able to benefit from the Service if that information is necessary to provide you with the Service or if we are legally required to collect it. 

  * ### a. Personal Data Provided by You

  * We ask you to provide certain Personal Data when you register for an account through our websites or mobile application, including your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, occupation, education, and gender. 

  * In addition, we collect Personal Data you provide in the context of a panel, when you participate in a survey or in connection with the receipt and redemption of rewards and incentives. Such information includes a unique panelist/respondent identification number we assign to you when you sign up for an account and the responses you provide when completing the survey. In this context, you may choose to provide sensitive Personal Data about you, such as Personal Data that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership.

  * We collect your location information for the above purposes with your consent. If you no longer wish to share your geo-location information with us, please change the privacy settings of your device. Where required by law, we obtain your explicit consent to share your location information with third parties.

  * ### d. Personal Data Obtained Via Automated Means

  * When you use the Service, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and similar technologies. Cookies are small files that store certain data on a device. Cookies create a unique ID that is associated with your browser. Session cookies expire when you close your browser, whereas persistent cookies remain on your device until deleted or once they reach a defined expiration date. 

  * The information we collect via cookies and similar technologies may include information about your device and its capabilities, including, the device type and operating system, other applications on your device, network and Internet service provider, time zone, network status, browser type, referring/exiting pages, operating system, date/time stamp, click stream data, and unique identification numbers such as your device IP address, device unique identification number, Media Access Control (MAC) address, or browser identifier. We may also use digital fingerprinting and watermarking technologies to collect the above information. 

  * We may also collect information from certain applications and functionality available on your device if you grant us access to these. Such information includes the number and type of applications installed, push notifications, camera, microphone, accessing photo library, file storage access, etc. 

  * We use this information to improve the Service by assessing how many users access or use the Service, which content, products, and features of our Service most interest our visitors, what types of offers our customers like to see, and how our Service performs from a technical point of view. 

  * In some cases, we may use information collected via automated means, along with other information, to recognize users (or households) across platforms or devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Information collected via digital fingerprinting and watermarking technologies may also be used for quality control, validation, and fraud detection and prevention purposes. 

  * First party and third party cookies and other similar or related technology and device identifiers (e.g., IDFAs, AAIDs, etc.) may be placed, written, set, and/or read for several purposes including, without limitation, to provide a better survey experience, quality control, validation, to enable or facilitate survey participation, tracking of completed surveys or other completed actions, for fraud detection and/or prevention, online ad effectiveness research, website tracking and audience measurement, to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with marketing campaigns, and for the purpose of targeting advertisements and other content to individuals, subject to your consent where required by applicable law. However, for certain cookies and/or similar or related technology, if you decide not to accept cookies, you will not be able to use the Service. 

  * With respect to the linking of data collected through the Service to third party data management platform (“ ** _DMP_** ”) data, RN SSI uses such data itself and/or permits RN SSI’s clients and/or the DMP itself to use such data to provide you with survey opportunities, to measure advertising effectiveness (as described in more detail below), to segment audiences; to design advertising campaigns using “look alike” cohort groups based on survey and third party data; and/or to market such third party’s products/services to you. 

  * _Audience Insights/Look-alikes_. RN SSI and/or third parties may use Personal Data and/or may link Personal Data to a third-party cookie to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with marketing campaigns. 

  * _Online Advertising Effectiveness_. In connection with RN SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding ads, promotions, content, campaigns, and/or websites that RN SSI is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, RN SSI’s clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a “ ** _Third Party Technology_** ” and collectively the “ ** _Third Party Technologies_** ”). The Third-Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, RN SSI’s servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third-Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and RN SSI’s client will use the Third-Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, RN SSI’s client will send your UID and the specific survey to RN SSI and RN SSI will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. 

  * _Audience Measurement Data_. In addition to the use and sharing of Audience Measurement Data (as defined below) in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, as such research is described above, RN SSI may share your UID and data previously collected by RN SSI, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, (“ ** _Audience Measurement Data_** ”), to third parties, including, without limitation, RN SSI’s subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the content, advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, and to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents). 

  * For more information on the types of cookies we use, the purposes for which we use information collected via cookies please see our [ Cookie Consent Tool ](https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/16761) . 

  * ### e. Personal Data We Process in relation to Survey about Clients’ Advertising

  * When you use the Service to participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that RN SSI is testing for its business clients, you may see these ads or promotions in several places, including in non-RN SSI mobile apps (e.g., in a gaming app). Once you have been exposed to the relevant ads and promotions, RN SSI will provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about these ads or promotions and/or may provide certain demographic data about you to the advertiser or the advertiser’s agent regarding the demographic profiles of individuals who have viewed the ad. 

  * To facilitate the completion of such surveys on ads or promotions, RN SSI has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including in other mobile apps. The Service provides ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and other information collected via automated means. Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that RN SSI is measuring for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform RN SSI that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows RN SSI to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. 

  * ### f. Personal Data Provided by Third Parties

  * We may obtain Personal Data, behavioral and/or demographic information from third parties, such as data management platforms, ad networks, information service bureaus, and sample suppliers. This collection may include, but is not limited to, age, gender, geography, location, presence of children, mobile ad IDs, purchase history, advertising exposures, look-a-like segments.
