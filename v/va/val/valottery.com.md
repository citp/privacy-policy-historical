The Virginia Lottery will not collect any personal information about you (i.e., your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you have access to the Internet, your computer automatically has an Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We use IP addresses to gather information to track the number of visitors to our website and to identify our most popular pages so we can improve site content. 

The only ways we can obtain your personal information are if you submit it to us through one of our interactive forms or send us a general inquiry or feedback.

If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it to us! If you have already sent this information to us and would like for us to delete it, please email us at [webmaster@myvalottery.com](mailto:webmaster@myvalottery.com)

While visiting our website, you may want to send the Virginia Lottery an email or request that we call you. If so, we may ask you to provide your name, the subject of your question or comment, and your email address or telephone number. This information is used solely to fulfill your online request. The Virginia Lottery does not seek to share this information with any other entity.

If you do nothing during your visit to the Virginia Lottery website but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

  * The Internet Domain and IP address from which you accessed our site.
  * The type of browser and operating system you used.
  * The date and time you visited our site.
  * The pages visited.
  * If you linked from another website, the address of that website.



The information collected is used to improve the content of our web services and help us understand how people are using our pages. We analyze our website logs to continually improve the value of the materials available on our site. The information in our web logs is not personally viewable and no attempt is made to link it with individuals who browse our website.

If during your visit to the Virginia Lottery website you send an email message, we collect your email address and the contents of the message you sent us. We use your email address to respond to you.

Except as specified above, the Virginia Lottery does not collect personal information.

The Virginia Lottery does not seek to share, sell or trade email addresses, information collected in surveys or in our guest book, or any other information about our online visitors. However, the Virginia Lottery will disclose user information if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against an individual who attempts, even unintentionally, to gain unauthorized access to the Virginia Lottery or to disrupt our website.

When you visit the Virginia Lottery website and request information, this site's server sends the request to you and then breaks the connection. The connection does not resume again until you perform another function. To ensure that we maintain the connection between our server and your computer for the duration of an online transaction, we may use a standard web technology called "cookies." A "cookie" is a very small amount of data that is sent from our server to your computer's hard drive. "Cookies" allow us to save the information that you input while progressing through an online transaction. If your browser is not configured to accept "cookies," you still will be able to access the information on our website. No user information is gathered through "cookies" on our website.

We maintain security standards and procedures regarding unauthorized access to ensure that the Virginia Lottery website remains available to all users and to prevent unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage to the site. Information on individuals causing, or attempting to cause, damage to the website will be traced and released to the appropriate legal authorities to investigate suspected or actual criminal activity.

For your convenience the Virginia Lottery website may provide links to other sites. However, the Virginia Lottery is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the websites to which we link. When you link to another site you are no longer on the Virginia Lottery website, and this Privacy Statement will not apply. When you link to another website, you are subject to the privacy policy of that new site. If you have questions or concerns about a site to which we link, please read the privacy and security information for that site.

The Virginia Lottery does not warrant the accuracy, reliability or timeliness of any information published on the Virginia Lottery website or any site to which we link, nor endorse any content, viewpoint, product or service linked from this system and shall not be liable for any loss caused by reliance on the accuracy, reliability or timeliness of such information.
