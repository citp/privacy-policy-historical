## Cookies

### Cookies and Technologies used by the Virginia Lottery

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on this website. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site while persistent cookies enable us to track the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

### Technologies used by Third Parties

## Website Security

We maintain security standards and procedures regarding unauthorized access to ensure that the Virginia Lottery Vendor Portal remains available to all users and to prevent unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage to the site. When you enter sensitive information on our website, that information is transmitted to the Lottery along an encrypted communication path. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Information on individuals causing, or attempting to cause, damage to the website will be traced and released to the appropriate legal authorities to investigate suspected or actual criminal activity.
