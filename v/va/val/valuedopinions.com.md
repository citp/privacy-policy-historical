**2\. Information Collected on this Website  **

Our research survey websites, including this site ([www.valuedopinions.com](http://www.valuedopinions.com/)), provide survey respondents with the opportunity to express opinions and attitudes about the most current issues. We conduct research that involves people from around the world, and we aggregate and anonymize such research (stripped of any personally identifiable information) before sending research results to our clients. In addition, certain survey findings might be published on our websites (in anonymous form) so that our respondents can be among the first to hear about the concerns and interests of people around the world. 

In order to compile our research studies, we may ask you to voluntarily submit personally identifiable information, which may include: 

  * your name and address, email address, telephone number and general contact details; 
  * images on film, photographs and telephone voice recordings; 
  * demographic information, such as your zip code, gender, country of origin or income level; 
  * your racial or ethnic origin; 
  * your political opinion(s) and/or political party with which you are affiliated; 
  * your religious or spiritual beliefs; 
  * whether or not you are a member of a labor union; 
  * your physical or mental health or condition; 
  * your sexual life; 
  * your hobbies and interests; and 
  * whether you have any type of criminal record, or have been arrested for any offense. 



In addition, you will need to submit your email address and password to login to the [www.valuedopinions.com](http://www.valuedopinions.com/) site. 

By registering on the [www.valuedopinions.com](http://www.valuedopinions.com/) site, you agree to receive emails from us, such as other survey invitations and reminders, communications about sweepstakes in which you have been selected as a winner, responses to inquiries that you submitted on our site, and inquiries regarding your status as a Research Now member. If we send you a survey invitation or reminder by email, we will always provide the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future emails by following the "unsubscribe" instructions at the bottom of the email. [See ["How We Use the Information You Provide - Email Communications"](http://www.valuedopinions.com/en/privacy.htm#q1) section below]. 

We may also ask third parties to send survey invitation emails on our behalf. In such cases, the people who receive those emails can choose to click on a link to be directed to Research Now's registration page on its site. The individual can then decide whether or not to register with Research Now. 

**3\. How We Use the Information You Provide**

If you have registered on the www.valuedopinions.com site, we will use the information you provide us primarily to contact you about surveys in which we would like you to participate, or to provide you with the results of the surveys. We may also use your personal information to:

  * notify you about new features on our websites, or other products or services in which we think you may be interested;
  * update our internal database of individuals willing to take part in research and surveys; 
  * determine which individuals registered with Research Now should be invited to participate in our surveys; 
  * provide you with information about incentives for responding to our survey requests; 
  * process your answers to surveys and summarize the results;
  * conduct research surveys on behalf of third parties;
  * transfer your survey responses to service suppliers who conduct process survey results on our behalf and under our direction; 
  * provide a unique, non-personally identifiable ID (not associated with you) to our research partners so they may conduct surveys on our behalf and report the findings to us;
  * to provide you with information relating to rewards provided by any third parties, including but not limited to a reward provided in response to your participation in surveys;

We may also share your personal information with Research Now subsidiaries or non-affiliated vendors, who may need to access and use your personal information to process your rewards, ensure that your mailing address is accurate, and eliminate duplicate information from our records. For example, Research Now provides our third-party fulfillment warehouse with names and mailing addresses so the warehouse can process and send paper gift certificates. 

**_Email Communications from Research Now_**

Research Now does not send unsolicited commercial emails. Nevertheless, Research Now voluntarily complies with the key privacy and disclosure provisions of the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act, including: 

  * providing truthful sender information; 
  * including a physical address for Research Now Inc. or the Research Now Inc. affiliate sending the email message; and 
  * providing a clear and simple opt-out method which is honored within ten (10) business days after the opt-out request is made. 



In addition, all survey invitations sent via email are consistent with the CASRO Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research. 

**_Survey Results_**

Research Now conducts surveys on behalf of its clients. Research Now's clients include U.S.-based businesses, as well as research organizations based in other jurisdictions who wish to survey people in the U.S. or elsewhere. 

Clients list the general demographic information (such as age range, ethnic background, and occupation) of individuals from whom they wish to ask survey questions. Based on the client's needs, Research Now contacts individuals who have registered on the site and invites them to participate in an online survey. 

Answers to the surveys are associated with unique, but non-personally identifiable ID numbers in Research Now's databases. Research Now may aggregate and interpret the answers in reports. 

**4\. Sharing Your Personal Information**

In order to provide you with the services on our sites, we may need to share your personal information with third parties, our agents, who perform services on our behalf, such as merchandise fulfillment, web hosting, and the like. Research Now may also share your personal data with affiliated companies in the Research Now group of companies (see "Company Background") or with unaffiliated third parties when permitted by law, as described above under "How We Use the Information You Provide". If Research Now acquires or spins off all or part of its business, or in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, it might convey its business assets, including survey participant data. If a change of ownership occurs, a notice will be posted here, so please check this policy regularly.

**5\. Accessing the Personal Information You've Provided  
**

If you provided personal information during registration or in response to a survey, you may change or modify such information by: 

  * Visiting the [www.valuedopinions.com](http://www.valuedopinions.com/) website, logging in, and updating your information; or 
  * Sending an email to [inquiries@valuedopinions.com](mailto:inquiries@valuedopinions.com)



If you choose to stop participating in our research surveys, you may unsubscribe from our survey invitations at any time by sending an email to [ mailun@valuedopinions.com](mailto:mailun@valuedopinions.com?Subject=Unsubscribe). Please be aware that even if you unsubscribe, we may maintain certain information in your registration profile for up to five (5) years for ordinary business purposes, such as reporting the aggregate number of registrations and cancellations to our non-affiliated partners. 

**6\. Safety and Security**

We use a variety of physical, administrative and technical measures to secure the data stored on our servers, including limiting physical access to our central data servers. Our policy is to allow only authorized personnel to access the physical areas where such servers are located. In addition, we use firewalls to protect the servers from outside intrusion. Please be aware, however, that no security measures are guaranteed to protect against unauthorized access. 

Please note that information submitted on the [ www.valuedopinions.com](http://www.valuedopinions.com/) site or otherwise sent to Research Now over the Internet may be transferred outside of the United States and outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), where data protection laws are not as strong as within these areas. Additionally, the United States does not place restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the United States. If you have any concerns in relation to such transfers, you should not use the Internet as a means of communication with Research Now. 

**7\. Children's Privacy**

Research Now believes that it's especially important to protect children's privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity. Although Research Now is based in the United Kingdom, Research Now complies with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). We do not seek to collect any personal information from children under 16 years of age. During the profile registration process, we collect birth date, and if an individual enters a birth date that indicates the individual is under 16, we block the registration and any personal information submitted by the individual is not saved in our database. From time to time, we may ask our adult survey respondents whether they have children residing with them who might have certain interests, such as favorite movies or music. In such event, we do not ask the child or parent to submit personally identifiable information about the child. 

If you would like to contact us about your information, any information about your child, or to find out how you can have your child's information removed from our database, please see the ["Accessing the Personal Information You've Provided"](http://www.valuedopinions.com/en/privacy.htm#q3) section of this policy.
