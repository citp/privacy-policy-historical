##### COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

Data:

Uses:

Subject to Your Rights & Choices, we use this information as follows:  
(i) for “essential” or “functional” purposes, such as to enable certain features of the Sites, or keeping you logged in during your session on the Media Site;  
(ii) for “analytics” and “personalization” purposes, consistent with our legitimate interests in how the Sites are used or perform, how users engage with and navigate through the Sites, what sites users visit before visiting our Sites, how often they visit the Sites, and other similar information, as well as to modify the content visible to you, the language in which our Sites appear, and otherwise tailor the Sites for your use. Our Site uses Google Analytics to obtain information about our Site’s users, and we may also link our Facebook app IDs to our Sites to learn more about visitors to our Sites and to see if you like or share our content; and  
(iii) (iii) for “retargeting” or similar advertising purposes, so that you can see advertisements from us on other websites. These technologies and the data they collect, may be used by advertisers to deliver ads that are more relevant to you based on content you have viewed, including content on our Sites. These tracking technologies may also help prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and help us understand whether you have interacted with or viewed ads we’ve delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting may take place on third-party websites that participate in the ad network (e.g. any advertisements delivered by that ad network on a third party website). 

Note:

Some of these technologies can be used by us and/or our third party partners to identify you across platforms, devices, sites, and services. Third parties may engage in use analytics using this data.

##### SPECIFIC PROCESSING PURPOSES

###### PERSONALIZATION

Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we may personalize our Sites. To do so, we may link together and analyze the Personal Data that we hold about you. Personal Data processed for personalization purposes, whether or not linked, may be augmented with Preferences Data. We may create Preferences Data, or obtain it from third parties, using Personal Data we hold about you. We process Preferences Data so that our communications and Sites are more relevant to you. For example, we may provide better recommendations to you, tailor content and communications to your interests, offer content in the language you choose, and use the information to guide overall improvements to our services. We may also use Preferences Data in connection with use analytics. See Your Rights and Choices for information about how you can limit or opt out of this processing.

###### USE ANALYTICS

We, and certain third parties operating on or through our Sites, may engage in use analytics by tracking and analyzing your interaction with and use of the Sites. This enables us to better understand how our users interact with our Sites. This process may include various parties and service providers, and may include Preferences Data, Device Data, Identity Data, and at times, Contact Data in order to more accurately monitor and analyze use of the Sites. The parties that control the processing of Personal Data for use analytics purposes may build a profile of you containing this information, and may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time. These services may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have used certain services. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to direct services to, determine whether and how services you use are effective, and may augment your profile with information derived from these observations. See Your Rights and Choices for information about how you can limit or opt out of this processing.

###### PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we (or if appropriate, our affiliates or trusted third parties) may send you promotional communications to the extent allowed by law: if you sign up for such communications, download curriculum from us, register on our Sites or for a promotion or contest with us or a partner, or in connection with your communications with, or submission of User Content to, us. These communications may be personalized. See Your Rights and Choices for information about how you can limit or opt out of promotional communications.

###### ADDITIONAL PROCESSING

If we process Personal Data in connection with our Sites in a way not described in this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy will still apply generally (e.g. with respect to Your Rights and Choices) unless otherwise stated when you provide it. Note that we may, without your consent, also process your Personal Data on certain public interest grounds. For example, we may process information as necessary to fulfil our legal obligations, protect the vital interests of any individuals, or otherwise in the public interest. Please see the data sharing section for more information.

#### Data Sharing

Information we collect may be shared with a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for and context in which that information was provided. We generally transfer data to the following categories of recipients:

Service Providers:

In connection with our general business operations, product/service improvements, to enable certain features, and in connection with our other legitimate business interests, we may share your Personal Data with service providers who provide certain services or process data on our behalf.
