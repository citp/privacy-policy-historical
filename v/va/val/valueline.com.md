# Privacy Policy

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy:**

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the privacy practices relating to our web sites [www.valueline.com](https://web.archive.org/) and [www.valuelinepro.com](http://www.valuelinepro.com/) (individually, the "Web Site" and collectively, the "Web Sites"). 

**What Personal Information We Collect:**

It is our policy to collect personal information that our members and visitors knowingly provide to us, and we take precautions to protect the information that we receive from you. 

We may require you to complete a registration form in order to use certain features of the Web Sites. When you register, you are only required to give us a user name, password, telephone number, and e-mail address. However, we may also ask for other identifying information (such as your name and street address) as well as other demographic data (such as your age, gender, and income). In the event you purchase a product or service from us, we will also require your credit card information and other shipping and billing data. 

If you are using our portfolio-tracking feature, news services or any other feature, we collect and store whatever information you voluntarily provide. 

**How We Use the Information We Collect:**

Some uses of your personal information are: 

To ensure that our Web Sites are protected against unauthorized access;   
To send you information about products and services we think might interest you;   
To notify you of updates to our products and services;   
To assist in the processing of any transactions between you and us;   
To deliver products and services you may order from us; and   
To use e-mail to answer your questions, to diagnose computer problems, or to administer the Web Sites.   
We recognize that any information you input into the portfolio-tracking feature is of special concern to you. We keep this information confidential and do not disclose it to unaffiliated parties. 

**Sharing Our Subscriber and Customer Lists:**

As is the practice among many publishers, we may make available to unaffiliated parties information that you provide us when ordering a subscription, product, or service. If you do not want such information shared with third parties, please email us at [infoprivacy@valueline.com](mailto:infoprivacy@valueline.com) or write us at: Information Privacy Manager, c/o Value Line Publishing, 220 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10017, and indicate your wishes in this regard. 

**Data Security:**

We take many precautions to protect your information from unauthorized third party access, alteration, theft, or misuse. For example, we use standard online security measures such as encryption and authentication to protect your credit card data. Regrettably, no computer system or online transaction is 100% secure, and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of the information you share with us. 

**Tracking Technologies:**

Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on your hard disk for future use. We and third party advertisers may place or read cookies on your computer or use other electronic tools to help analyze web traffic, determine targeted advertisements, facilitate automated activity, store and track passwords, and determine appropriate solicitations by tracking your movement through the Web Sites. Cookies are destroyed whenever you log off the Web Sites, shut down your browser or reboot your computer. Your web browser will allow you to disable cookies, but you will not be able to successfully log on to and participate in many features of our Web Sites if you do so. Therefore, you will always remain in guest status if cookies are disabled. 

We may use Web beacons, provided by third-party advertising companies, to help manage and optimize our online advertising and product performance. Web beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the Web Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to the Web Site. The use and collection of your information by these third-party service providers, and third-party advertisers and their advertising servers is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  To learn more about these practices, cookies, and how to "opt-out" of a third party vendor's use of cookies, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).  Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns. 

In some cases, we may automatically (i.e., not via registration) collect technical information when you connect to our Web Sites that are not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the IP address from which you are linked to our Web Sites. We use this information to help keep the websites running smoothly and to analyze how visitors use our Web Sites. 

**Links:  **

The Web Sites contain links to other web sites. We have no control over and are not responsible for the privacy policies of such sites. Whenever you link to another web site, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that any information that you provide is going to a third party, and therefore you should familiarize yourself with that party's privacy policy. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by Value Line's Web Sites. 

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy:**

If our privacy policy changes, we will notify all users by posting the new policy on our Web Sites. Please check back here periodically to review our latest policy. 

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information:**

You can request a copy of the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you via the Internet (or correct any factual inaccuracies) by contacting our Information Privacy Manager at the address below. 

**How to Contact Us About Privacy Matters:**
