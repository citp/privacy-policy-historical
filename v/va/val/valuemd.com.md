We, at Value MD Limited Liability Company, hereafter refered to as "ValueMD", are committed to respecting your privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number). That is why ValueMD has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. 

Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" so that we can better serve you with more tailored information when you return to our site. Cookies are identifiers which a Web site can send to your browser to keep on your computer to facilitate your next visit to our site.

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

**INFORMATION**

We want to give you information about our privacy policy and assure you that we take reasonable steps to see that it is followed within our company. 

**CHOICE**

There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the ValueMD.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services. 

**ACCURACY**

We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and update your information in the future.
