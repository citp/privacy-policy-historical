(a US Company), Research Now Pty Limited (an Australian  						Company), Research Now Technology Hellas EPE (a Greek Company), Research Now  						GmbH (a German Company), and Research Now Srl (a French Company) (together  						"Research Now") operate the Valued Opinions websites. This Privacy Policy  						governs the website located at <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank"> 							www.valuedopinions.com</a>. 					
</p>
<p> 						Research Now is a member of various trade associations in the U.S. and Europe,  						including the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) Code of  						Standards and Ethics for Survey Research, the European Society of Opinion and  						Marketing Research (ESOMAR) Codes and Guidelines for Survey Research, Marketing  						Research Association, American Marketing Association and the UK-based Market  						Research Society.

<p><strong>2. Information Collected on this Website&nbsp;</strong> 					
</p>
<p> 						Our research survey websites, including this site (<a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank">www.valuedopinions.com</a>),  						provide survey respondents with the opportunity to express opinions and  						attitudes about the most current issues. We conduct research that involves  						people from around the world, and we aggregate and anonymize such research  						(stripped of any personally identifiable information) before sending research  						results to our clients. In addition, certain survey findings might be published  						on our websites (in anonymous form) so that our respondents can be among the  						first to hear about the concerns and interests of people around the world. 					
</p>
<p> 						In order to compile our research studies, we may ask you to voluntarily submit  						personally identifiable information, which may include: 					</p><ul><li> 						your name and address, email address, telephone number and general contact  						details; 						</li><li> 						images on film, photographs and telephone voice recordings; 						</li><li> 						demographic information, such as your zip code, gender, country of origin or  						income level; 						</li><li> 						your racial or ethnic origin; 						</li><li> 						your political opinion(s) and/or political party with which you are affiliated; 						</li><li> 						your religious or spiritual beliefs; 						</li><li> 						whether or not you are a member of a labor union; 						</li><li> 						your physical or mental health or condition; 						</li><li> 						your sexual life; 						</li><li> 						your hobbies and interests; and 						</li><li> 							whether you have any type of criminal record, or have been arrested for any  							offense. 						</li></ul><p> 						In addition, you will need to submit your email address and password to login  						to the <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank">www.valuedopinions.com</a> 						site. 					
</p>
<p> 						By registering on the <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank">www.valuedopinions.com</a> 						site, you agree to receive emails from us, such as other survey invitations and  						reminders, communications about sweepstakes in which you have been selected as  						a winner, responses to inquiries that you submitted on our site, and inquiries  						regarding your status as a Research Now member. If we send you a survey  						invitation or reminder by email, we will always provide the opportunity to  						opt-out of receiving future emails by following the "unsubscribe" instructions  						at the bottom of the email. [See <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com/en/privacy.htm#q1" target="_blank">"How We Use the Information You  							Provide - Email Communications"</a> section below]. 					
</p>
<p> 						We may also ask third parties to send survey invitation emails on our behalf.  						In such cases, the people who receive those emails can choose to click on a  						link to be directed to Research Now's registration page on its site. The  						individual can then decide whether or not to register with Research Now. 					
</p>
<p><strong>3. How We Use the Information You Provide</strong> 
</p>
<p>If you have registered on the www.valuedopinions.com site, we will use the information you provide us primarily to contact you about surveys in which we would like you to participate, or to provide you with the results of the surveys. We may also use your personal information to:</p><ul><li>notify you about new features on our websites, or other products or services in which we think you may be interested;</li><li>update our internal database of individuals willing to take part in research and surveys; </li><li>determine which individuals registered with Research Now should be invited to participate in our surveys; </li><li>provide you with information about incentives for responding to our survey requests; </li><li>process your answers to surveys and summarize the results;</li><li>conduct research surveys on behalf of third parties;</li><li>transfer your survey responses to service suppliers who conduct process survey results on our behalf and under our direction; </li><li>provide a unique, non-personally identifiable ID (not associated with you) to our research partners so they may conduct surveys on our behalf and report the findings to us;</li><li>to provide you with information relating to rewards provided by any third parties, including but not limited to a reward provided in response to your participation in surveys; </li><li>contact you by email to invite you to take part in surveys and offline focus groups; and/or </li><li>invite you to enter a sweepstakes or participate in other incentive programs as a reward for participating in our surveys;</li><li>comply with applicable laws and regulations; and</li><li>respond to your inquiries about Research Now or its website. </li></ul><p>We may also share your personal information with Research Now subsidiaries or non-affiliated vendors, who may need to access and use your personal information to process your rewards, ensure that your mailing address is accurate, and eliminate duplicate information from our records. For example, Research Now provides our third-party fulfillment warehouse with names and mailing addresses so the warehouse can process and send paper gift certificates.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Email Communications from Research Now</em></strong> 					
</p>
<p> 						Research Now does not send unsolicited commercial emails. Nevertheless,  						Research Now voluntarily complies with the key privacy and disclosure  						provisions of the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act, including: 					</p><ul><li> 						providing truthful sender information; 						</li><li> 						including a physical address for Research Now Inc. or the Research Now Inc.  						affiliate sending the email message; and 						</li><li> 							providing a clear and simple opt-out method which is honored within ten (10)  							business days after the opt-out request is made. 						</li></ul><p> 						In addition, all survey invitations sent via email are consistent with the  						CASRO Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research. 					
</p>
<p><strong><em>Survey Results</em></strong>
</p>
<p> 						Research Now conducts surveys on behalf of its clients. Research Now's clients  						include U.S.-based businesses, as well as research organizations based in other  						jurisdictions who wish to survey people in the U.S. or elsewhere. 					
</p>
<p> 						Clients list the general demographic information (such as age range, ethnic  						background, and occupation) of individuals from whom they wish to ask survey  						questions. Based on the client's needs, Research Now contacts individuals who  						have registered on the site and invites them to participate in an online  						survey. 					
</p>
<p> 						Answers to the surveys are associated with unique, but non-personally  						identifiable ID numbers in Research Now's databases. Research Now may aggregate  						and interpret the answers in reports. 					
</p>
<p><strong>4. Sharing Your Personal Information</strong> 
</p>
<p>In order to provide you with the services on our sites, we may need to share your personal information with third parties, our agents, who perform services on our behalf, such as merchandise fulfillment, web hosting, and the like. Research Now may also share your personal data with affiliated companies in the Research Now group of companies (see "Company Background") or with unaffiliated third parties when permitted by law, as described above under "How We Use the Information You Provide". If Research Now acquires or spins off all or part of its business, or in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, it might convey its business assets, including survey participant data. If a change of ownership occurs, a notice will be posted here, so please check this policy regularly.<br><br>
</p>
<p><strong><a name="q3">5. Accessing the Personal Information You've Provided<br></a></strong> 					
</p>
<p> 					If you provided personal information during registration or in response to a  					survey, you may change or modify such information by: 					</p><ul><li> 								Visiting the <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank">www.valuedopinions.com</a> 							website, logging in, and updating your information; or 							</li><li> 								Sending an email to <a href="mailto:inquiries@valuedopinions.com">inquiries@valuedopinions.com</a></li></ul><p> 						If you choose to stop participating in our research surveys, you may  						unsubscribe from our survey invitations at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:mailun@valuedopinions.com?Subject=Unsubscribe"> 							mailun@valuedopinions.com</a>. Please be aware that even if you  						unsubscribe, we may maintain certain information in your registration profile  						for up to five (5) years for ordinary business purposes, such as reporting the  						aggregate number of registrations and cancellations to our non-affiliated  						partners. 					
</p>
<p><strong>6. Safety and Security</strong> 					
</p>
<p>We use a variety of physical, administrative and technical measures to secure  						the data stored on our servers, including limiting physical access to our  						central data servers. Our policy is to allow only authorized personnel to  						access the physical areas where such servers are located. In addition, we use  						firewalls to protect the servers from outside intrusion. Please be aware,  						however, that no security measures are guaranteed to protect against  						unauthorized access. 					
</p>
<p>Please note that information submitted on the <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank"> 							www.valuedopinions.com</a> site or otherwise sent to Research Now over the  						Internet may be transferred outside of the United States and outside of the  						European Economic Area (EEA), where data protection laws are not as strong as  						within these areas. Additionally, the United States does not place restrictions  						on the transfer of personal data outside of the United States. If you have any  						concerns in relation to such transfers, you should not use the Internet as a  						means of communication with Research Now. 					
</p>
<p><strong>7. Children's Privacy</strong> 					
</p>
<p>Research Now believes that it's especially important to protect children's  						privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with  						their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity. Although  						Research Now is based in the United Kingdom, Research Now complies with the  						U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). We do not seek  						to collect any personal information from children under 16 years of age. During  						the profile registration process, we collect birth date, and if an individual  						enters a birth date that indicates the individual is under 16, we block the  						registration and any personal information submitted by the individual is not  						saved in our database. From time to time, we may ask our adult survey  						respondents whether they have children residing with them who might have  						certain interests, such as favorite movies or music. In such event, we do not  						ask the child or parent to submit personally identifiable information about the  						child. 					
</p>
<p>If you would like to contact us about your information, any information about  						your child, or to find out how you can have your child's information removed  						from our database, please see the <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com/en/privacy.htm#q3" target="_blank">"Accessing the Personal Information  							You've Provided"</a> section of this policy. 					
</p>

When we use cookies, we do so to help us recognize you as a prior user of this  						site.
