Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message).

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via reviews, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the ValueAppeal site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.

##  Shared Information

We may share your personal or business information as described below:

_Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:_ We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may operate stores at the Site, sell items to you through the website or offer you products or services that may be of interest to you. In other situations, ValueAppeal may provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a particular opportunity or transaction, and we will share user information that is related to such opportunity or transaction with that affiliated business.

_Agents:_ We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Without your permission, ValueAppeal's agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

_Business profiles:_ Business profile information including business name, address, phone number and email address is displayed to users publicly in connection with the Service. As part of our Website and the Service, you will receive from ValueAppeal and other users and partners of ValueAppeal e-mail and other communication relating to your business and/or the products and services you offer.

_Business Transfers:_ In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if ValueAppeal, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the event that ValueAppeal goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ValueAppeal may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy.

_With Your Consent:_ Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personally identifiable individual information may be shared with third parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information.

##  Customer Surveys

ValueAppeal may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.

We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of the Service to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties.
