Please keep this in mind when considering what information to post to the Site.

When you use or access the Site, we may collect certain usage data generated by your activities on the Site, including your purchasing history, credit card chargeback data, pages viewed, number of bytes transferred, hyperlinks clicked, and other actions you take on the Site.

  * Online Information-Gathering Tools.

If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then your use of the Site may not be as efficient as if the cookies were enabled. For example, if you have chosen to enable Google to associate your web and app browsing history with your Google account, and to use information from your Google account to personalize ads, Google will use data from you while signed-in to your Google account (personal information), together with Google Analytics advertising cookies and identifiers to tailor ads to your indicated preferences, across your devices. We do not share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that can by itself be used to contact or identify you) with advertising measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. You may [opt-out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) of Google Analytics by following Google's [opt-out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) instructions.
  * Third-Party Integrated Services. We may incorporate third-party ads and other third-party content on the Site, and integrate other third-party offerings into the Site, enabling certain such third parties to collect information about you or your online activities across other websites and, over time, through your use of the Site. For example, Google uses cookies to serve the Google Reviews badge on the Site, and to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Site. You may opt-out of Google's use of cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Site by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/).

We may keep the information we collect about you indefinitely.

### When Information We Collect May Be Disclosed to Third Parties

We disclose to third parties the personal or other information collected about you either (1) when we have otherwise secured your permission to do so, or (2) in any of the following situations, with your permission based on this disclosure: 

  * We may share your order information with select vendors and manufacturers to assist them in their sales and marketing efforts; to facilitate reporting and information sharing regarding adverse drug events and disease control; and to expedite rebate calculation and payment services.

  * We may share the information collected about you within the Valley Vet family of companies-which means we may disclose the information collected about you to our affiliates, subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
  * We may disclose the information collected about you to our third-party contractors and partners in connection with their performance of services or other activities in support of the Site and our businesses, or their completing or confirming on our behalf a transaction or series of transactions that you conduct with us. For example, your credit or debit card number and expiration date, name, address, transaction amount, chargeback data, browsing and transaction history, computer location, and IP address and related data may be collected and provided to our merchant payment processor and its vendors, agents, suppliers, and contractors for the purpose of processing payment transactions and providing fraud detection, prevention, and scoring services.
  * Information about you that is collected by third-party ads, content, or technologies integrated with the Site may be disclosed to such third parties.
  * We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you and other users of the Site without restriction. In these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.
  * We may disclose to one or more third parties the information collected about you as part of a potential or complete merger, acquisition, or other sale or transfer of any of the assets or business of Valley Vet, or any of our affiliates. Please note that the entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions may not comply with all of the terms of this privacy policy.
  * We may disclose information about you to the government or to other third parties to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, and subpoenas or other legal process, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity associated with the Site or our business. We reserve the right to release information collected through the Site to law enforcement or other government officials, as we determine to be necessary or appropriate.
  * We may also disclose information about you to third parties if needed to enforce any of the terms of use or other agreements for the Site, or any investigation of potential violations of those agreements; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; to protect against harm to the Site; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of our users or others (for example, to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection).



### Security Measures for Information We Collect

To help protect the privacy of information we collect, we employ security measures that are intended to be consistent with industry best practices. In storing such information, we take commercially reasonable steps intended to protect such data against unauthorized access. But please be aware that the Site is operated on software, hardware, and networks, and any component may experience breaches of security or other problems beyond our control that may compromise the security of information collected about you.

Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the Internet or via a Wi-Fi network, or any encryption method, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Thus, it may be possible for third parties not under Valley Vet's control to intercept or access your personal information transmitted through the Site or via email. We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all information you provide through the Site, but due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any such information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others who do not have your authorization. Any such transmission of information about you to Valley Vet is at your own risk.

### How to Correct or Update Information We Have Collected About You

You may correct or update information we have collected about you by contacting us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy, or, if available on the Site, by editing your information and preferences on your Account Information page on the Site. You may also unsubscribe from any email subscriptions by following the applicable "unsubscribe" link. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to update our files to reflect your request as promptly as possible.

We may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and enforcement of our terms of use and other agreements. Also, please note that we cannot update any information about you collected through the Site that has already been disclosed (as permitted under this privacy policy) to a third party.

### How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

The Site does not currently support "Do Not Track" preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, the Site is not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set. For more information about Do Not Track, visit donottrack.us.

### Transfer of Data from Outside the United States

If you use the Site from outside the United States, information that we collect about you through the Site will be transferred to servers inside the United States and maintained indefinitely. By using the Site, you consent to the transfer of data into the United States, and the processing of such data in the United States.

### Children

The Site is not designed to appeal to persons under 13 years of age (children). We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children through the Site. If we learn that any unauthorized personal information of a child has been collected, we will take appropriate steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided any such personal information to us, you may contact us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy and request that we delete that information from our systems.

### Privacy Policies of any Linked Website or Other Parties

This privacy policy only addresses Valley Vet's practices for the personal and other information that we may obtain about you through the Site, or through your other communications with Valley Vet. Please be aware that when you use or access the Site, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control, and Valley Vet is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, or the content of linked websites. We would expect that most, if not all of these third parties will collect information about you when you use their offerings. But Valley Vet is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, regardless of whether they are linked or otherwise connected to the Site. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy and terms of use whenever interacting with any third-party website, app, or other offering.

### Your California Privacy Rights

Sometimes we may share information collected about you with our affiliates and other third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Under California law, a California resident with whom we have an established relationship has the right to request certain information regarding the types of personal information that we have shared with third parties for these purposes, and the identities of those third parties-within the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to us at service@valleyvet.com.
