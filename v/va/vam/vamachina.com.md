**1\. Personal data**

Non-personal and aggregated information collected automatically 

When you visit our Site, non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of VAMA’s Internet servers, in order to monitor and enhance your online experience. Such recorded information may include (without being limited to) your IP address, the name of your internet service provider, the operating system and the type of browser you used, the date and duration of your visit, the name(s) of the visited page(s), the amount of transferred data. 

Personal information that you choose to submit 

As a general policy, you are not required to disclose your personal data as a condition of using this Web Site. No personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to the Web Site. 

However, VAMA Web Site’s various registration forms and surveys may request that you give us contact information (such as your name, mailing and/or e-mail address) and profile data (such as your preferences). In many cases, you choose the amount of information you supply (e.g. when sending us information through the Site, you may choose to include only an e-mail address for replies). There may be cases, however, where some of the information requested is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. In such cases, if you do not provide mandatory personal information with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. 

If you request information through this Web Site and supply VAMA with your e-mail address or your name and postal address, you accept that this data will be used for the purpose of providing the requested information and that VAMA may use this data in the future to provide other information about VAMA that might be of interest to you.

**3\. Use of cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s computer hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using our Sites easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. These cookies are restricted for use only on our Sites, and do not transfer any personal information to any other party. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. (Note: you will need to consult the help area of your browser application for instructions.) If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of VAMA Web Sites will not function properly or may be considerably slower. 

**4\. Use of IP addresses**

An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you’re surfing the Web. When you request pages from VAMA’s Web Site, our servers log your IP address. VAMA collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to audit the use of our Site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you are anonymous to us. We may exceptionally use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, Sites, customers, or others. 

**5\. Security**

Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, VAMA cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

**6\. Contact:**

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of our Sites, or your dealings with our Sites, you can contact: VAMA [contactus@vamachina.com](mailtoa: contactus@vamachina.com "Contact VAMA"). 

Information provided by you via general e-mail inquiries to VAMA such as your e-mail address is used only to respond to your inquiries in the ordinary course of business, and is never shared with third parties. 

**7\. General:**

You may not assign these Terms of Use or any of your interests, rights or obligations under these Terms of Use. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.
