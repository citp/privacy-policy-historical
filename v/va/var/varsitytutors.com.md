# Privacy Policy

Effective: December 9, 2016 

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Varsity Tutors LLC (“Varsity Tutors”) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of its www.varsitytutors.com Site and any derivative or affiliated Sites on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the “Site”). Please note that this Privacy Policy covers Varsity Tutors’ practices regarding information collected from its Site. 

##  The Information Varsity Tutors Collects 

Like most website operators, Varsity Tutors collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our Site. 

Additionally, certain visitors to Varsity Tutors’ Site choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with us online – by purchasing packages of tutoring hours – are asked to provide additional information, such as the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. Varsity Tutors also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors, however, and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information, as described below. A User browsing the Site without registering an account or affirmatively providing personally identifiable information to Varsity Tutors does so anonymously. 

Varsity Tutors may collect personally identifiable information from customers in a variety of ways. Personally identifiable information may include (i) contact data (such as a customer’s name, mailing and e-mail addresses); (ii) financial data (such as a customer’s credit card number); and (iii) demographic data (such as a customer’s zip code, age and income). A User may also provide personally identifiable information about others, such as emergency contact information for notification in the event a situation requires it. If you communicate with Varsity Tutors by e-mail; post messages to forums; make telephone or cell phone calls, communicate through electronic devices or other interactive devices; complete online forms, surveys or contest entries; or communicate with Varsity Tutors by any means, any information provided in such communication may be collected by Varsity Tutors. Varsity Tutors may also collect information about how customers use our Site, for example, by tracking the number of unique views received by the pages of the Site, or the domains from which customers originate. 

##  Refer-A-Friend 

If you choose to use our referral service to refer a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Varsity Tutors stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. 

Your friend may contact us at privacy [at] varsitytutors.com to request that we remove this information from our database. 

##  Information Sharing 

It is Varsity Tutors’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect through the Site, e-mail, phone, or any other communications we have with you. We treat the confidential information you share with us, such as students’ academic performance and any financial information, with the utmost respect. Varsity Tutors will not disclose student records with third parties under any circumstance, except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law. 

We may, however, share a student’s information with the tutor(s) who may or will be providing tutoring to the student so that they may evaluate the engagement and personalize and tailor the tutoring to the student. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Varsity Tutors. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below in the section “How Varsity Tutors Uses Information”. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities. 

##  Tracking Technologies

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.
