# Varuna Multimedia Privacy Policy & Disclaimer

Our Privacy Policy for www.VarunaMultimedia.com and www.ThrimanaTV.com is given below. 

The privacy of our visitors to www.VarunaMultimedia.com and www.ThrimanaTV.com is important to us. At www.VarunaMultimedia.com and www.ThrimanaTV.com, we recognise that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit www.VarunaMultimedia.com and www.ThrimanaTV.com, and how we safeguard your information. 

**Log Files**

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as Big Pond, Optus or AOL), your geographical area (e.g. country and state), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Firefox), the technology that you are using to access (PC, Mobile Phone, Tablet, etc.), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. However, we do NOT collect any other personal information about you. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. We also use third party advertisements on www.VarunaMultimedia.com and www.ThrimanaTV.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google Inc.) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing Sydney real estate ads to someone in Sydney, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

**DoubleClick DART cookies**

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer or device when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”).

The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Melbourne, you may see Melbourne hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about Cricket). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you.

You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/ or http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx 

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in Internet-Security programs. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums.

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
