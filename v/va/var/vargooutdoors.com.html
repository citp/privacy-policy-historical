<p><strong>Social Sharing Features</strong></p>
<p>The Services may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools, which let you share actions you take on the Services with other media, and vice versa.&nbsp; The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature.&nbsp; For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>VARGO takes reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
<p><em>Your Information.</em>&nbsp;You may update or correct your online account information by logging into your online account and updating your information.&nbsp; You may also email us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="file:///C:/Users/VARGO/Documents/Website/info@vargooutdoors.com%C2%A0">info@vargooutdoors.com&nbsp;</a></span>if you wish to deactivate your online account, but note that we may retain information about you for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.</p>
<p><em>Promotional Communications.</em>&nbsp;You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from VARGO by following the instructions in those communications or changing your preferences.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your purchases, account, membership or our ongoing business relations.</p>

These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by VARGO and these third parties to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third party cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of these third parties to learn more about their privacy practices. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used in this way, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
<p>We also use a third party to "power" product reviews on our Services.&nbsp; When you submit a product review, you become subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of this third party and the reviews you submit may be posted on our Services and on third-party sites.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it permits California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. VARGO qualifies for this alternative option. To opt out of having your information shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please call us at 570-437-2770</p>
