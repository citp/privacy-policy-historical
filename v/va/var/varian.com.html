<h5>Effective date: January 27, 2009</h5>

<p>Varian Medical Systems (Varian) is committed to respecting your privacy.  As you visit our website, our intent is that your experience is informative, convenient and secure.  Because Varian is committed to responsibly managing the personal information provided, we have adopted the following privacy statement to explain our commitment to your privacy. </p>

<p>This privacy statement applies to our www.varian.com website, which includes www.my.varian.com.  This privacy statement is located on each online webpage where personal information is collected. This privacy statement discloses Varian's practices with respect to the type of information that we gather, the way we use information internally and our policy regarding sharing information with others.</p> 

<p>We encourage you to read this privacy statement carefully in order to ensure that you are in control of your personal information received by our company.</p>

<h3>Collection and Use Of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>When you visit our website, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information (PII).  PII means any information that is related to an identified person, or that may be used to identify an individual, including: first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address or phone number. We may also ask you to provide other personal information such as title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, or personal interests that is necessary or useful to provide a product or service that you have requested. </p>

<p>If you chose to make a purchase or sign-up for an on-line service, we may collect additional information such as your credit card information, billing address, and other billing account information.</p>
 
<p>If you have signed-up to receive newsletters or other marketing material, we may collect your first and last name, title, physical address and other personally identifiable information necessary to enhance your visit to Varian's website or request information regarding our products or services.</p> 

<h3>Domain Name and IP Address</h3>

<p>We collect the domain names and IP addresses of our visitors for statistical purposes, in order to measure use of our website, to improve the content or responsiveness of our site or to customize the content or layout of the site for the individual visitor. We may also aggregate information relating to our visitors' traffic patterns from the data that we collect and retain concerning the IP addresses and domain names of our visitors, and we may divulge such aggregate information about our users with third parties such as our business partners, distributors, and service and support providers.</p>

<p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>You may visit our website anonymously if you wish, by using appropriate software or web services available from or through third parties.</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>We maintain a log file of all actions that are initiated or facilitated using our website, to capture, record and store data concerning the transaction. Access to this data is restricted to those who administer our network and public website.</p>

<h3>E-mail Address</h3>

<p>You should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against all forms of interception. If your communication includes sensitive information about you and you would prefer not to transmit this information in this fashion, please contact us by mail or telephone rather than e-mail.</p>

<p>We collect e-mail addresses that are volunteered by the visitor, from e-mail messages addressed to our company or its employees, or through visitor participation in surveys and site registrations.</p>

<p>We use the e-mail addresses for marketing purposes and to inform those interested in our products about events, products, services or other items of interest. Additionally, we use the e-mail addresses to notify visitors about recent updates to our website, to provide product or service news notifications or newsletters, and to confirm registrations or reserved seating at seminars and conferences. We also use the e-mail addresses to process orders for products, services, brochures and other written materials.</p>

<p>You may opt-out of receiving the promotional or marketing e-mails at any time by (1) notifying us at the address specified at the bottom of any unwanted e-mail, (2) specifying your preference at the time of application or (3) changing your e-mail preferences in any user profile that you may have created. These opt-out procedures will not be available for e-mails that are necessary to provide confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service request or change in the visitor's user profile) or for e-mails that confirm a visitor's status as a registered user of the Varian website.</p>

<h3>Other Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>We may use a mailing address or phone number that a visitor provides for a variety of Varian-related reasons. We may send periodic mailings to visitors or make telephone calls to inform our visitors who have provided a mailing address or telephone number of new products, services or events. Your mailing address and telephone number may also be used to contact you about orders placed on-line, as a reminder about events for which you have registered, or to provide information that you have requested.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to receive such calls or mailings, you may request to be removed from the contact list by contacting marketing communications at <a href="mailto:marcom@varian.com">marcom@varian.com</a>.</p>

<h3>PII Released To Outside Parties</h3>

<p>Any information that you provide to us will be used for our purposes only. Except as specified in this privacy statement, your information will not be shared with individuals outside the employ of Varian, or with other companies.</p>

<p>In some instances we may provide your name and delivery address to third parties that we use for delivering specific products or services to you (such as support services, shipping or direct mail organizations). In such cases, your name and delivery address is not retained by these third parties.</p>

<p>Varian's investor relations services and direct mailing functions are run by outside vendors. These companies receive information provided by the visitor and supply the visitor with the material requested. In connection with the investor relations function, the visitor is taken to a third-party website. Varian and these companies have entered into an agreement whereby the vendor has promised that the information supplied by Varian's visitors will not be shared with outside companies nor will such visitor information be used for any purposes other than to perform a service or supply materials requested by the visitor.</p>

<p>As a good corporate citizen, Varian complies with applicable law and legal obligations to respond to governmental, law enforcement and court requests for personally identifiable information and other information and data about our visitors and their transactions. Varian's Legal Department may access and use your personally identifiable information and other information or data to protect our rights, in the event of a dispute or in response to legal process, law enforcement inquiries or abuse of our website.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.</p>

<p>We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in you internet browser's "help" file.</p>

<p>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p> 

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We suggest that you change your passwords often, that your passwords include a combination of letters and numbers, and that you make certain that you are using a secure browser. Products and services are available which can help give you privacy protection while navigating the Web. See <a href="http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/rulesntools.shtml" target="_blank">www.privacyalliance.org/resources/rulesntools.shtml</a> for an overview of many privacy-related tools.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can email us at <a href="mailto:dataprivacyoffice@varian.com">dataprivacyoffice@varian.com</a>.</p>

<p>Your Varian X-ray products online store account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. We safeguard the security of the data you send us with certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We have taken reasonable precautions to protect against misuse, theft, loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of your personal information. For seminar registrations, our forms are sent through a server protected by a firewall. Additionally, we use industry-standard-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. If there is ever a time when we will need to transfer or receive particularly sensitive information we will notify you in an appropriate fashion.</p>

<h3>Updating Your Personal Profile</h3>

<p>If for any reason you wish to correct, update, or delete your personal profile please email us at <a href="mailto:dataprivacyoffice@varian.com">dataprivacyoffice@varian.com</a>. Varian will respond to your request for access within 30 days of receiving your request.</p>

<h3>Data Forwarding</h3>

<p>We maintain your personal information on servers and computers located in the United States and operated under our direct supervision and control. If you request information from us which best falls under the expertise of a foreign office, we may forward your contact information to that office so that office may respond to your request directly. Otherwise, we do not forward your personal information outside the United States.</p>

<p>We replicate the Varian.com server daily to Crawley, England. We send back-up tapes of the Varian e-commerce site to Crawley, England on occasions when major changes have been made to the e-commerce site.</p>

<h3>Data Quality</h3>

<p>We will take reasonable steps to insure that all data collected is accurate, complete and timely for the purposes for which they are to be used. In order to maintain an accurate database, we may supplement any of the information above with information you have provided to us by other means or channels such as sales representatives. We urge you to check your profile regularly to insure that such information is accurate, complete and timely.</p>

<p>Your email address and other contact information is added to our general customer database so we may periodically contact with new product and promotion information.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>We do not structure our website to attract children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone who is 13 years of age or younger.</p>

<h3>Third Party Sites</h3>

<p>Varian's website may contain links to other sites. When you click on one of these links you are being transferred to a website operated by someone other than Varian, and the operator of that website may have a different privacy policy. Varian does not share your personal information with these websites and is not responsible for their individual privacy practices. We encourage you to investigate the privacy policies of these operators.</p>

<p>When you are on our site, please be aware that we have links to other sites that may have the look and feel of our site. Be aware that you are on a site that is actually controlled by our third party hosting service provider.</p>

<h3>Service Providers</h3>

<p>We use third party vendors for different uses such as event registration, applying for a position with us and credit card processing.  When you sign up for these services, we will share information such as your PII or sensitive data as necessary for a third party to provide that service.  PII collected via these sites are stored on the vendors' system, not at varian.com.</p>

<p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>

<h3>Participation in Privacy Protection Programs</h3>

<p>Varian participates in the TRUSTe Program as a licensee, and we proudly display the TRUSTe Privacy Seal. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to advance privacy and trust in the networked world by providing a third party oversight function, and a dispute resolution mechanism. Our participation in the TRUSTe Program, and our compliance with its requirements and procedures, is our means of assuring you of our commitment to the protection of the privacy of your personally identifiable information and our participation in the US-EU Safe Harbor Program.</p>

<p>The TRUSTe program only covers information that is collected through this website, and does not cover information that may be collected through any software downloaded from this website.</p>

<p>For further information on the TRUSTe Program, see http://www.truste.com. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprivacyoffice@varian.com">dataprivacyoffice@varian.com</a>.

<p>Varian Medical Systems, Inc. abides by the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>

<h3>Future Changes</h3>

<p>By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this privacy statement. Varian may decide to change this privacy statement from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
