<p><strong>Effective date: November 5, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Varian Medical Systems, Inc.   (Varian) is committed to respecting your privacy. As you visit our website, our intent is that your experience is informative, convenient and secure. Because Varian is committed to responsibly managing the personal information provided, we have adopted the following privacy statement to explain our commitment to your privacy.</p> 
<p>This privacy statement applies to our <a href="http://www.varian.com">www.varian.com</a> website, which includes <a href="http://my.varian.com">my.varian.com</a>. This privacy statement is located on each online webpage where personal information is collected. This privacy statement discloses Varian's practices with respect to the type of information that we gather, the way we use information internally and our policy regarding sharing information with others.</p>
<p>We encourage you to read this privacy statement carefully in order to ensure that you are in control of your personal information received by our company.</p>
<h3>Collection and Use Of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>When you visit our website, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information (PII). PII means any information that is related to an identified person, or that may be used to identify an individual, including: first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address or phone number. We may also ask you to provide other personal information such as title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, or personal interests that is necessary or useful to provide a product or service that you have requested.</p> 
<p>If you chose to make a purchase or sign-up for an on-line service, we may collect additional information such as your credit card information, billing address, and other billing account information.</p>
<p>If you have signed-up to receive newsletters or other marketing material, we may collect your first and last name, title, physical address and other personally identifiable information necessary to enhance your visit to Varian's website or request information regarding our products or services.</p>
<h3>Domain Name and IP Address</h3>
<p>We collect the domain names and IP addresses of our visitors for statistical purposes, in order to measure use of our website, to improve the content or responsiveness of our site or to customize the content or layout of the site for the individual visitor. We may also aggregate information relating to our visitors' traffic patterns from the data that we collect and retain concerning the IP addresses and domain names of our visitors, and we may divulge such aggregate information about our users with third parties such as our business partners, distributors, and service and support providers.</p>
<p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>You may visit our website anonymously if you wish, by using appropriate software or web services available from or through third parties.</p>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>We maintain a log file of all actions that are initiated or facilitated using our website, to capture, record and store data concerning the transaction. Access to this data is restricted to those who administer our network and public website.</p>
<h3>E-mail Address</h3>
<p>You should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against all forms of interception. If your communication includes sensitive information about you and you would prefer not to transmit this information in this fashion, please contact us by mail or telephone rather than e-mail.</p>
<p>We collect e-mail addresses that are volunteered by the visitor, from e-mail messages addressed to our company or its employees, or through visitor participation in surveys and site registrations.</p>
<p>We use the e-mail addresses for marketing purposes and to inform those interested in our products about events, products, services or other items of interest. Additionally, we use the e-mail addresses to notify visitors about recent updates to our website, to provide product or service news notifications or newsletters, and to confirm registrations or reserved seating at seminars and conferences. We also use the e-mail addresses to process orders for products, services, brochures and other written materials.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of receiving the promotional or marketing e-mails at any time by (1) clicking on the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of the message, (2) notifying us at the address specified at the bottom of any unwanted e-mail, or (3) changing your e-mail preferences in any user profile that you may have created. These opt-out procedures will not be available for e-mails that are necessary to provide confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service request or change in the visitor's user profile) or for e-mails that confirm a visitor's status as a registered user of the Varian website.</p>
<h3>Other Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>We may use a mailing address or phone number that a visit;or provides for a variety of Varian-related reasons. We may send periodic mailings to visitors or make telephone calls to inform our visitors who have provided a mailing address or telephone number of new products, services or events. Your mailing address and telephone number may also be used to contact you about orders placed on-line, as a reminder about events for which you have registered, or to provide information that you have requested.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive such calls or mailings, you may request to be removed from the contact list by contacting marketing communications at <a href="mailto:marcom@varian.com">marcom@varian.com</a>.</p>
<h3>PII Released To Outside Parties</h3>
<p>Any information that you provide to us will be used for our purposes only. Except as specified in this privacy statement, your information will not be shared with individuals outside the employ of Varian, or with other companies.</p>
<p>In some instances we may provide your name and delivery address to third parties that we use for delivering specific products or services to you (such as support services, shipping or direct mail organizations). In such cases, your name and delivery address is not retained by these third parties.</p>
<p>Varian's investor relations services and direct mailing functions are run by outside vendors. These companies receive information provided by the visitor and supply the visitor with the material requested. In connection with the investor relations function, the visitor is taken to a third-party website. Varian and these companies have entered into an agreement whereby the vendor has promised that the information supplied by Varian's visitors will not be shared with outside companies nor will such visitor information be used for any purposes other than to perform a service or supply materials requested by the visitor.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your internet browser's "help" file.</p>
<p>We use third-party tracking services that use cookies, scripts and other tracking technologies to track non-personal information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.</p>

Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We suggest that you change your passwords often, that your passwords include a combination of letters and numbers, and that you make certain that you are using a secure browser. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Products and services are available which can help give you privacy protection while navigating the Web.

We have taken reasonable precautions to protect against misuse, theft, loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of your personal information. For seminar registrations, our forms are sent through a server protected by a firewall. Additionally, we use industry-standard-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. If there is ever a time when we will need to transfer or receive particularly sensitive information we will notify you in an appropriate fashion.</p>
