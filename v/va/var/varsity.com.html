            Collection of information is usually grouped into two categories: personally identifiable
            information and so-called 'aggregate' information. Personally identifiable information
            is any information in Varsity's possession that is associated with a specific user
            of our site (such as a name or address) and information we collect about how individual
            visitors use our site (such as the fact that a visitor likes entertainment news

            which is general demographic information (such as the total number of visitors who
            are more than 35 years old).

            On a limited basis, we use 'cookie' technology. Cookies are pieces of information
            that an Internet site transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
            Our servers then use these cookies to make your sessions easier by saving your preferences
            while you are on Varsity.com pages. The use of cookies is an industry standard --
            you'll find them almost everywhere on the Internet. Our cookie usage is single session-only
            information, and is not stored across multiple sessions. There are two cookies used
            throughout our site. The first cookie allows us to know who the Visitor is and that
            he or she properly authenticated into our network. This cookie information can be
            used to retrieve personal information needed during the Visitor session, for example,
            to build your customized pages. Personal user information is stored only temporarily
            in this cookie. Once this information is retrieved for this purpose, the visitor
            identity is not stored or used for any other purpose. The second cookie is an 'advertising'
            cookie which we use to keep track of the ads you have seen. Varsity.com tracks which
            ads have been viewed, and we tie it to demographic data, but not to personally identifiable
            information. Remember, this describes cookie usage ONLY on Varsity.com (and its
            affiliate) sites. We have no control over the use of cookies by other Internet sites
            and their owners.

            If you make a purchase from a store hosted by Varsity.com (please note that this
            does NOT include linked e-commerce sites where the 'Return to Varsity.com' phrase
            appears in the frame), you need to review the merchant's privacy policy prior to
            providing them with your information. The information obtained during your visit
            to those stores, and the information you give such as your credit card number and
            contact information, is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions
            to take place and for the items to be shipped to you. However, these merchants,
            by contract, cannot use this information for any other purpose without your permission.
            For example, the merchant may ask if you would like to receive marketing information
            directly from them. If you choose to receive this information (by checking an 'opt-in'
            box at the point of purchase), you will receive marketing information directly from
            the merchant in the future until such time as you ask them directly to be taken
            off of their distribution list. While we encourage all of our merchant partners
            to adhere to a privacy policy, it is a good idea to read the merchant's privacy
            policy yourself before agreeing to give them permission to use your personal information
            for marketing purposes. For example, their privacy policy may not prevent them from
            selling or sharing your personal information with other third parties. If you do
            not grant our merchant partners permission to contact you with marketing information
            (which will be signified by checking an 'opt-out' box at the point of purchase or
            by leaving an 'opt-in' box blank), the merchant is prohibited from contacting you
            directly, except to communicate customer service information regarding a specific
            purchase and cannot share or sell any of your information to third parties.</p>

            Although the Internet offers a wealth of information and exciting opportunities
            to explore, some of its content may not be suitable for children. Understandably,
            as the popularity of the Internet has grown, so have concerns among parents. Varsity.com
            believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and suggests
            that they consider using parental control tools such as Cyber Patrol, and software
            manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please instruct your children not to give us their name, address or e-mail address,
            or provide any personal information to anyone without your permission. It may also
            be wise to carefully note all the people with whom your child frequently corresponds
            over the Internet or on any online service.

            opportunity to make friends and talk to people all over the world. Please remember,
            though, that these interactive features are just like other public places where
            strangers meet. If you allow your children to access interactive features, please
            remind them of the dangers involved when corresponding or communicating with strangers
            or new acquaintances on the Internet (especially in Chat and Newsgroups, as well
            as when using e-mail).
        </p>
        <p>
            We strongly recommend that you supervise your children's activities on these areas
            as you would in any public area. You should help your children understand that people
            they do not know will be reading their notes. They should be careful when choosing
            what to post (particularly information about themselves), as well as when choosing
            the people with whom they correspond. Also, only you, as a parent, can establish
            which topics and individual notes are appropriate for your family, just as you would
            for television programs or movies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Children and teenagers get a lot of benefit from being online, but they can also
            be targets of crime and exploitation in this as in any other environment. Trusting,
            curious, and anxious to explore this new world and the relationships it brings,
            children and teenagers need parental supervision and common sense advice to ensure
            that their experiences in 'cyberspace' are happy, healthy, and productive.
        </p>

            <strong>How <a name="Parents" id="Parents">Parents </a>Can Reduce the Risks </strong>
            | <a href="#">back to top</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Take advantage of Cyber Patrol. Also, to further restrict your child's access to
            discussions, forums, or bulletin boards that contain inappropriate material, some
            Internet sites and private bulletin boards have systems in place for parents to
            block out parts of the sites that they feel are inappropriate for their children.
            If you are concerned, you should contact the site find out how you can add these
            restrictions to any accounts that your children can access.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Internet and some private bulletin boards contain areas designed specifically
            for adults who wish to post, view, or read sexually explicit material. Most private
            bulletin board operators who post such material limit access only to people who
            attest that they are adults but, like any other safeguards, be aware that there
            are always going to be cases where adults fail to enforce them or children find
            ways around them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best way to ensure that your children are having positive online experiences
            is to stay in touch with what they are doing. One way to do this is to spend time
            with your children while they're online. Have them show you what they do and ask
            them to teach you how to access the sites. While children and teenagers need a certain
            amount of privacy, they also need parental involvement and supervision in their
            daily lives. The same general parenting skills that apply to the 'real world' also
            apply while online.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have cause for concern about your children's online activities, talk to them.
            Also seek out the advice and counsel of other computer users in your area and become
            familiar with literature on Cyber Patrol and other filtering devices. Open communication
            with your children, utilization of such computer resources, and getting online yourself
            will help you obtain the full benefits of these devices and alert you to any potential
            problem that may occur with their use.
        </p>

            <strong><a name="Guidelines" id="Guidelines">Guidelines </a>for Parents </strong>
            | <a href="#">back to top</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            By taking responsibility for their children's online computer use, parents can greatly
            minimize the potential risks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make it a family rule to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Never give out identifying information - home address, school name, or telephone
                    number - in a public message such as chat or bulletin boards, and be sure you are
                    dealing with someone that both you and your child know and trust before giving it
                    out via e-mail. Think carefully before revealing any personal information such as
                    age, marital status, or financial information. Consider using a pseudonym or unlisting
                    your child's name from Internet sites in which they participate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Consider keeping the computer in a family room rather than the child's bedroom.
                    Be sure to make this a family activity. Get to know their 'online friends' just
                    as you get to know all of their other friends.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Get to know the Internet sites your child uses. If you don't know how to get to
                    them, get your child to show you. Find out what types of information it offers and
                    whether there are ways for parents to block out objectionable material.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with another computer user
                    without parental permission. If a meeting is arranged, make the first one in a public
                    spot, and be sure to accompany your child.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are suggestive, obscene,
                    belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable. Encourage your children
                    to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or your child receives a message
                    that is harassing, or of a sexual nature, or threatening, alert the appropriate
                    law enforcement agency.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Should you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography
                    while online, immediately report this Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the
                    National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by calling 1-800-843-5678.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Remember that people online may not be who they seem. Because you can't see or even
                    hear the person, it is easy for someone to misrepresent him - or herself. Thus,
                    someone indicating that 'she' is a '12-year-old girl' could really be a 40-year-old
                    man.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Remember that everything you read online may not be true. Any offer that's 'too
                    good to be true' probably is. Be very careful about any offers that involve your
                    coming to a meeting or having someone visit your house.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children. Discuss these
                    rules and post them near the computer as a reminder. Remember to monitor their compliance
                    with these rules, especially when it comes to the amount of time your children spend
                    on the computer. A child or teenager's excessive use of the interactive features
                    of the Internet, especially late at night, may be a clue that there is a potential
                    problem.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Because some of the content on the Internet consists of material that is adult-oriented
            or otherwise objectionable to some people, the results of your search may automatically
            and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Varsity.com
            has no control over, and can make no claim that such surprises will not occur. Computerized
            search technology does not give you search results limited to only the hits that
            you were seeking. There may be extraneous hits as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Varsity.com recommends that to avoid any such surprises, you take advantage of the
            access controls that Varsity.com offers, as we discuss above, and be diligent in
            your supervision of any children you allow to use Varsity.com Internet.
