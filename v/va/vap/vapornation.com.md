### 3.3. Personal Information Collected From Third Parties

We may combine the Personal Information that we have collected about you with other information about you obtained from other sources (both online and offline), such as from third parties and public sources. For example, if you connect with us on social media, including Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, we may use the platforms’ data analytics and advertising tools to obtain Personal Information about you such as your demographics, interests, location and other characteristics, to use for research and analytical purposes, as well as for targeted or online behavioral advertising on other websites.

We also may collect your Personal Information from companies with whom we have partnered with, such as Indeed or JazzHR, through which you can apply for a job at Greenlane. We may associate this information with other Personal Information you have submitted and that we have collected about you. 

## 4\. Personal Information Automatically Collected

### 4.1. Automated Tracking

In addition to Personal Information, we and our third-party partners, also automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Websites, use our Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. This includes your details about which of our e-mails you open, forward, or click, IP address (which is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer), date and time stamps for your Website session; sites visited before and after interacting with our Websites; page views, page navigation, and links that are clicked on our Websites; ad blocker status; and, certain device data (such as operating system type, device type or model, location, browser type and version, user language and other system settings). The information we collect using automated tracking technologies is for our legitimate business purposes, including to prevent fraudulent activity and transactions to protect your privacy. 

### 4.2. Cookies

We typically collect this information through first and third party cookies. “Cookies” are text files that are placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences and to facilitate certain functions on our Websites. For example, in order to purchase a product on our Websites, you add items to your shopping chart and then proceed through checkout. We use cookies so that our Websites will recognize you and keep track of your order status as you navigate through the checkout process, and to keep your shopping cart contents available should you return to purchase after leaving the session. These cookies do not contain or track sensitive information such as your payment information. 

We also use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (“URL”) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit or the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to make our Websites more useful to you. 

We also use cookies to understand Website usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Websites. For example, we collect analytics data through Google Analytics - a third-party cookie provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to help us understand the market for our Services and to develop promotional and marketing campaigns. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information on behalf of us as the operator of the Websites for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Websites, compiling reports on Website activity for Website operators and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage. You can opt out from being tracked by Google Analytics with effect for the future by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for your current web browser: Click Here

You may also set your browser to not accept any other cookies; however, some features of the Website may not function properly without the use of cookies. For more information on your choices regarding the use of cookies, please see Section 11.2. 

### 4.3. Web Beacons

We use technology known as web beacons and similar technology to collect web log information. A web beacon is a tiny graphic used on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered by the computer that hosts our Websites (called a "webserver”) when you visit our Websites. Web beacons in e-mails help us determine which of our e-mail messages were opened and whether a message was acted upon. They also help us analyze the effectiveness of our web pages by measuring the number of visitors to certain pages of our Websites and how many visitors click on key elements of it.

### 4.4. Cross-Tracking Devices

Greenlane uses data analytics companies, advertising networks or social media companies, and features offered by Google Analytics services or pixels such as from Facebook and LinkedIn to engage in “cross-device tracking,” which occurs when platforms, publishers, and advertising technology companies try to connect a consumer’s activity across smartphones, tablets, desktop computers and other connected devices. The goal of cross-device tracking is to enable companies to link a consumer’s behavior across devices.

### 4.5. Social Media Plug-Ins

We use social media plug-ins on our Websites to enable you to easily share information with others. We use the information collected from the plug-ins to learn about your interests and to help us better understand how to serve you. This information may include your preferences about how to contact you, your product preferences, languages, marketing preferences, and some demographic data. These plug-ins may include those from companies like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn. The social media plug-ins may allow these companies to receive directly identifiable Personal Information about you and your visit to our Websites. When you visit our Websites, the operators of the social media plug-ins on our Websites place cookies on your computer that enable them to recognize you on websites belonging to them and their affiliates and partners after you have visited our Websites, or that enable them to add the information collected from your visit to our Websites with your prior activity on those websites. The social media plug-ins collect this information about users whether they specifically interact with the plug-in or not, and it may enable social media companies to share information about your web-browsing navigational information with some of their other users. 

Greenlane does not control what information is collected by the social media plug-ins or the information practices adopted by those social media companies. For more information about social plug-ins from social media websites, you should refer to those companies’ privacy and data sharing statements.

## 9\. Age Verification

Some of the products that we sell on our Websites are highly regulated and age-restricted. We are required and committed to preventing sales to anyone under the legal purchasing age. We will only send you marketing materials and information that encourage or facilitate a purchase of our products after you have certified that 1) you are of legal purchasing age for the product you wish to purchase, and 2) that you understand that providing false information may constitute a violation of the law. 

Before you can make a purchase from a product specific newsletter mailing list, we will verify your age through a non-affiliated third-party service provider to perform an age and identify verification check for adherence to this requirement. We utilize these trusted verification services to verify the information that you provide and ensure that you qualify to access and purchase products from the Website. This process has been developed with your privacy in mind with detailed information neither shared nor accessible. 

In some cases, we may require that you provide a government-issued identification (“ID”) or other forms of valid ID. If through the third-party verification service we are not able to verify your age and/or identity, you will be requested to upload a copy of your government ID so that our team can manually verify your date of birth. Photo ID’s are uploaded to our third-party partner’s secure database and we simply process the result that they provide – we do not receive a file with your ID to be stored on our servers or database. 

## 10\. Children’s Privacy

Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 21. We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 21 on our Websites.
