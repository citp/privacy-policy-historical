<p>VacationRentals.com is serious about protecting the privacy of our
owners and our renting visitors. We use information collected about
you only to process and bill orders and to make our Web site a more
useful and valuable service. We respect the privacy of those who visit
or become advertisers. Our privacy policy is stated below, but please
be aware that should you follow a link on our Web site to another Web
site, you are no longer covered by this policy. It is a good idea to
understand the privacy policy of any Web site before sharing personal
information with it.</p><p>

</p><h4><b>Your Information: What, How, and Why?</b></h4>

<h3><b>Property Owners/Advertisers and Vacation Planning Visitors</b></h3>

<p>In order to process a request you may have, we need to know contact
information that could include all or some of the following: your full
name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of
an advertising listing, a method of payment. Vacation Rentals will use
this information to contact you from time to time with critical customer
updates and information, or to send you information about new services
or opportunities. You will be able to "unsubscribe" and not receive
marketing information, but we must always be able to e-mail you critical
information about your account and our mutual business relationship.</p>

<p>Your information is not shared with third parties, except: 1) in the
case of special promotions by Vacation Rentals, or one of its partners,
about which you've requested to be notified; 2) where a third party
performs services on behalf of Vacation Rentals and has agreed to keep
such information confidential (such as the processing of your credit
card payment or the conduct of an online survey for example); and 3)
the aggregate use of the information of multiple Vacation Rentals
advertisers and visitors where individual personal information is not
disclosed. Vacation Rentals shares Web site usage information about
advertisers and visitors with a third-party tracking company for the
purpose of reporting statistics. For this purpose, some of the pages you
visit on our Web site use pixel tags (also called clear gifs). Vacation
Rentals also uses your information to market its services and to gain
feedback on potential new services.</p>

<h3><b>Newsletters</b></h3>

<p>As an advertiser or visitor to Vacation Rentals.com, you will receive
either or both of our Owner or Traveler newsletters. You may cancel your
subscription to these newsletters at any time.</p>

<b>Surveys</b>

<p>Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our
visitors. From time to time, we request owner or newsletter subscribers'
input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision
to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from
surveys to improve our service.</p>

<h3><b>Inquiries</b></h3>

<p>Site visitors may send inquiries to our property owners/advertisers
via clickable links on Vacation Rentals listings. If you choose to send
an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your
e-mail address and any other information you supply, will be visible to
the owner of the property you inquired about so that they might reply
directly to you. Do not share information in the e-mail that you are not
prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit
card and bank account information. These inquiries are sent to both the
individual owner/advertiser you selected and retained by Vacation Rentals.
The resulting inquiry is available for review only by the owner/advertiser
to whom they were initially addressed and to Vacation Rentals customer
service employees, who may be asked by advertisers for their past inquiry
information. While the content of these inquiries is not shared with any
other party, Vacation Rentals.com may, from time to time, use third party
e-mail servers to send and track receipt of the inquiry e-mails, and
analyze the pattern of inquiry usage via these third party tracking
systems.</p>

<p>All inquiries sent through Vacation Rentals are accepted and are
governed by our Terms and Conditions of Service and our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4><b>How Do We Protect Your Information Once We Have It?</b></h4>

<p>All personal information is stored on a secure server. We do not store
credit card numbers or identifying information on any Vacation Rentals.com
server. All such information is stored by Paradata, our credit card
processing partner, on their secured servers, and is protected via its
proprietary methods.</p>

<p>Please remember that many services and transactions are performed by
our business partners. Our privacy policy and our security or common
practices do not apply to other companies.</p>

<h4><b>What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?</b></h4>

<p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to
store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that
browser. Vacation Rentals.com may uses cookies to store some personal
preferences for your future visits. Cookies allow us to recognize you
more quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site can be more
personalized and productive. You'll find that cookies are an industry
standard and are used at most major Web sites in much the same way we
use them here at Vacation Rentals.</p>

<p>We use third-party site usage tracking companies to analyze your Web
site visit or to conduct surveys. In the course of serving our pages,
these third parties may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your
browser. These companies may use information (not including your name,
address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to Vacation
Rentals.com and other Web sites in order to help us understand how to
serve you better.</p>

<p>By using our Web site and signing up for Vacation Rentals services, you
consent to the collection and use of the previously mentioned information
by Vacation Rentals and our affiliates. This policy is subject to change
without notice. Privacy issues represent a growing concern for all Web
users. To keep up-to-date with our policies, please check this page
frequently. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions
of this policy at any time.</p>
