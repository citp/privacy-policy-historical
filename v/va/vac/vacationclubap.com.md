Creating an Account Profile

Owners of MVCI properties or timeshare interests may, at their choice, create a personal account profile online within our password-protected Members Clubhouse.

Please note that Marriott Vacation Club International will never send you email requesting your user name, password, credit card number or social security number. If you receive an email that looks like it’s from Marriott Vacation Club International, but asks you for your credit card number or social security number, it is a fraudulent email, or “phish.” We recommend that you do the following: 

  * Forward the email to the Federal Trade Commission at spam@uce.gov or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) to report it. The FTC uses the spam stored in this database to pursue law enforcement actions against people who send deceptive email. 
  * Delete the email.



If you believe “phishers” have gotten access to your personal or financial information, we recommend that you also do the following: 

  * Change your password.
  * Contact credit reporting services and have a fraud alert attached to your credit report file. Please be aware that the perpetrator may attempt to use your information to establish accounts or obtain credit at other businesses in their name.
