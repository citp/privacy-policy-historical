# Privacy Statement - Virginia Credit Union

  
Serving your needs and protecting your personal information are priorities for Virginia Credit Union. We do not sell or provide personal or account information to third parties for telemarketing or any other independent use. To offer you financial products and services that help you achieve your financial goals, we may, however, share information with selected companies that help us provide services and process your transactions.

Under these arrangements, we may disclose all the information we collect, as described below, to those companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. To protect our members' privacy, we work only with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of information we provide. We do not permit these companies to sell to other third parties the information we provide to them. 

Information We Collect And Disclose About You  
We may also disclose information we collect about you under circumstances as permitted or required by law. These disclosures typically include information to process transactions on your behalf, conduct the operations of our credit union, follow your instructions as you authorize, or protect the security of our financial records. 

We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you that we collect from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on membership and loan applications and other forms; 
  * Information about your transactions with us or others;
  * Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency; 
  * Information obtained when verifying the information you provide on an application or other forms, such as from your current or past employers or from other institutions where you conduct financial transactions. 



If you close your membership with Virginia Credit Union, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as permitted or required by law.
