          Please note that Marriott Vacation Club International will never send you email requesting your user name, password, credit card number or social 
          security number. If you receive an email that looks like it’s from Marriott Vacation Club International, but asks you for your credit card number

        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 11px; color: #666;">
          <li>
            Forward the email to the Federal Trade Commission at spam@uce.gov or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) to report it. The FTC uses the spam stored
