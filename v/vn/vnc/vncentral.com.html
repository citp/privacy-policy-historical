<b>NOTICE</b> <br>
      VNCentral will notify you when it is collecting personally identifiable 
      information about you, as well as the use or uses VNCentral intends to 
      make with such information. For example, we may need to collect 
      information to respond to your requests for search results, buying 
      products, requesting information, or to allow you to send or post 
      messages, or for billing purposes. We also keep information about 
      customers, individual shopping sessions, and purchases in a secure 
      database on our servers in order to fulfill online transaction and banking 
      requirements.
      <p><b>ANONYMOUS INFORMATION</b><br>
      We may collect certain non-personal information from your IP address. This 
      information is used only to provide an enhanced on-line experience for our 
      visitors by optimizing our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity 
      of your Internet browser,&nbsp;IP address, referral data, platform type, and 
      search terms ). We may also use this non-personal information to determine 
      the total number of visitors to our Web sites. </p>
      <p><b>USE OF COOKIES</b><br>
      When you view our Web site, we may store some information on your 
      computer. This information will be in the form of a 'Cookie' and will help 
      us in many ways. For example, Cookies allow us to tailor a Web site to 
      better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet Browsers, 
      you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block all Cookies, or 
      receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser 
      instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. </p>
      <p><b>INFORMATION COLLECTED IN DELIVERY OF ADVERTISEMENTS</b><br>
      In the course of delivering an advertisement to VNCentral visitors, 
      VNCentral, or its advertising agency, does not collect any 
      personally-identifiable information about the Web site user, such as the 
      user's name, address, phone number or email address. VNCentral' 
      advertising agency does, however, collect non-personally identifiable 
      information, such as the server a user's computer is logged onto, the 
      user's browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and 
      whether the user responded to the advertisement delivered. </p>
      <p>VNCentral' use of the non-personally identifiable information 
      collected by VNCentral' advertising agency may include targeting 
      advertisements and measuring advertisement effectiveness.</p>
      <p><b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b><br>
      Personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected only 
      when knowingly and voluntarily submitted by those visitors. VNCentral 
      uses such information only for the purpose for which it was submitted, 
      unless we disclose other uses at the time of collection. VNCentral does 
      not sell personal information to third parties. VNCentral may share 
      personally identifiable information with other parts of our company, but 
      this will never be used on an individual basis outside of the company. 
      VNCentral maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, 
      integrity, and privacy of personally identifiable information in its 
      possession. VNCentral may use such personally identifiable information in 
      the aggregate (non-identifiable) form to make our Web site better and more 
      responsive to the needs of our visitors. This statistical compilation of 
      non-identifiable information may also be used by or provided to others for 
      marketing, advertising, or research purposes. </p>
      <p><b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b><br>
      VNCentral chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. 
      However, VNCentral is not responsible for the content or privacy 
      practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to or 
      from our Web site. These links are meant for the visitor's convenience 
      only. Links to third party Web sites do not constitute sponsorship, 
      endorsement, or approval by VNCentral of content, policies or practices 
      of such sites. Once you have left the VNCentral Web site via such a link, 
      you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. 
      VNCentral may also be linked to Web sites operated by companies 
      affiliated with VNCentral. Visitors to those sites should refer to their 
      separate privacy policies and practices. </p>
      <p><b>CHAT ROOMS, MESSAGE BOARDS AND SUBMISSIONS</b><br>
      Should any visitor to VNCentral Web site provide information, questions, 
      comments, suggestions, reviews or any material through the feedback 
      mechanisms located in the Web site, VNCentral shall have no obligation of
