In postback tracking (also called “server-side tracking”), vNative directly sends a session identifier to the advertiser on click. On conversion, the advertiser then communicates that identifier to vNative for validation. **vNative** also supports server-to-server measurement for some clients. With any of the mentioned methods, when an end user clicks on an advertisement, goes to a specific web page or mobile app action that a Client chooses to monitor, **vNative** collects information from the User’s computer or device, including but not limited to IP and Ad Identifiers.

10. **Cookies** : User can disable cookies in most internet browsers. Disabling cookies will not, however, stop receipt of all advertisements.

End users can also disable collection of Ad Identifiers for targeted advertising by enabling the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their smartphone. End users can also reset the Ad Identifier altogether using their smartphone’s privacy settings. End users should also note that **vNative** collects information on behalf of its clients. To opt out, please see optoutmobile.com or contact the data controller directly. We will actively work with our clients to fulfill such requests as reasonable and required by law.
