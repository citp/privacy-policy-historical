Vdopia provides an advertising platform for mobile media and related services to connect advertisers that are part of the Vdopia's network ("<b>Advertisers</b>") with publishers of mobile applications and mobile websites ("<b>Publishers</b>"), by facilitating the sending of advertisements through such platform ("<b>Ads</b>").

We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
<br><br>

As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

This section of the Privacy Policy applies to information that Vdopia may collect, access and/or obtain about Consumers who view Ads while using or accessing a Publisher's mobile application or mobile site (collectively, "<b>Mobile Media</b>").
<br><br>
Our primary goals in collecting, accessing or obtaining information are to deliver tailored Ads based on the inferred interests of Consumers, and measure their effectiveness with Consumers.  We do this by utilizing the non-identifying information that we collect access or obtain through cookies and Pixel Tags (defined below) embedded on a Mobile Media on which you view Ads, in conjunction with the information about you that is provided by you or provided to us by our Publishers, to personalize the content of Ads that you see. You can opt-out of receiving targeted Ads as described below.

<li class="Blackbuttel">Our Publishers allow us to serve Ads on their Mobile Media. We use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile application, the advertisements and links that appear on the Mobile Media. If you use a Mobile Media, we automatically receive your IP address and mobile device ID when this happens, and we use other technologies (such as cookies and Pixel Tags, as described below) to measure the effectiveness of the Ads and to personalize the advertising content that you see on the Mobile Media.  We also collect, access or obtain other non-identifying information in conjunction with your IP address and/or device ID; these non-identifying details include, but are not limited to, the website you are logged onto or the application you are using, the geographic location of the IP address you are using to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many web pages have been viewed by you, which applications you have used, search terms used, referring/exit pages, platform type and date/time information. We do not collect, access or obtain personally identifiable information (such as name, username, address, phone number or email address) from you when you view or interact with Ads.

We may also receive from Publishers additional, non-identifying information that they collect about you, such as location information or demographic information.

We aggregate this information and use it to analyze trends, identify the audience most likely to respond to an Ad and to tailor Ad placement for members of our advertising network accordingly. This aggregated information may be shared with our affiliates, Advertisers, employees, customers and Publishers.  In addition, we may share with such entities any device IDs and associated demographic data. Any information shared in this context will not contain your personally identifiable information. We reserve the right to track IP addresses for the purposes of fraud prevention, and we reserve the right to release IP addresses to legal authorities.

Cookies

We use cookies in connection with Ads served through our platform. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your mobile device's memory for record-keeping purposes when you are served an Ad. Cookies help us better understand the effectiveness of an Ad (for example, by tracking the way in which you respond to, select and interact with an Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view an Ad). Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information and they can help control the number of times you view an Ad.

We may also use "pixel tags" "web beacons", "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively "<b>Pixel Tags</b>") to analyze usage patterns of Consumers and to serve Ads to you that are tailored based on our analysis. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, which is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a webpage or in a mobile application and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain Mobile Media and pages within Mobile Media, to personalize the Ads, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
