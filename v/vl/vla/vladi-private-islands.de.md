**2.7 Google Analytics**  
This offer uses Google Analytics, a web analysis tool of Google Inc. (“Google”).

Information generated through the Cookies about the usage of this website by the user is generally transferred to a Google server in the US and stored there.

There are only a few exceptional cases, where the full IP address will be directed to a Google Server in the US and abbreviated there. The IP anonymisation is active on this website. On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information, in order to evaluate the usage of the website by the user, compile reports on the website activities and provide further services in terms of website and internet usage to the website owner. The IP address submitted from your browser by Google Analytics, will not be merged with other Google data. Users can prevent the installation of Cookies by activating the relevant browser-software settings. However, users will be informed that in this case, it is very likely that not all features on this website can be used to their full extent.
