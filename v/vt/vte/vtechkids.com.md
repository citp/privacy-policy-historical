# VTech Privacy Policy | VTech Terms and Conditions

**LAST UPDATED January 22, 2016**

**_For specific information practices with respect to children, please see Section 7 below orclick here _****_._**

VTech Electronics North America, L.L.C. ("VTech") appreciates your interest in our company and your visit to our website, web-connected software applications or other online service (collectively, the "Web Services"). If you do not live in the U.S., please visit www.VTech.com to find the appropriate privacy policy for your use. 

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") reflects VTech's commitment to protect your and your children's privacy and personal information. In this Policy, VTech may be referred to as "VTech," "we," "us" or "our." Although VTech sells and promotes children's products, the Web Services (with the exception of Kid Connect, discussed below) are intended for adult use, and VTech's information collection practices are targeted primarily toward adults. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, all references to "you" or "your" refer to adult users. 

Although VTech is committed to protecting your and your children's personal information no matter how it is obtained, this Policy addresses only data obtained through the Web Services. It does not address data VTech receives or collects through any other means. It also does not address any information given to us for business or employment purposes, such as job applicant information submitted through the "Careers" section of any of our websites. This Policy describes the information we collect from visitors to or users of the Web Services, where we store that information, how we use that information and when we may disclose it to others. 

**1.

Agreement; Modification.

**

Your use of the Web Services constitutes your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not accept this Policy, please do not visit or use the Web Services. VTech may change this Policy from time to time. Each time you visit or use the Web Services, the current version of this Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you visit or use any of the Web Services, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the beginning of this Policy) and review any changes since the last version. 

**2.

Information VTech Collects.

**

**2.1

Information that You Provide.

**

To access certain features of the Web Services, you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself and/or your child or children. The types of information that you would need to provide are described below. You may choose not provide such information when requested, but doing this could limit or completely prevent you from being able to use or access certain features of the Web Services. 

_(a) Personal Identifying Information._ In order to access certain features of the Web Services or to purchase items offered through the Web Services, you may be required to provide your first and last name, mailing address, billing and shipping addresses, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card information. We call this type of information "Personal Identifying Information" ("PII"), because it would allow us and others who may have access to it to personally identify you or contact you. Although VTech will not knowingly ever request or collect PII from children, certain Web Services may also ask you for other, limited forms of personal information about your children (e.g., your child's first name, date of birth, gender). Other services (in particular, Kid Connect) may collect limited forms of personal information from your child, but only if you consent. Information practices regarding children are discussed more fully in Section 7, below. 

_(b) Registration Data._ Certain Web Services may ask for or collect additional information about you and/or your children. This information may include information about recent purchases, information about your interests and the interests and activities of your child, your child's play or activity data from VTech web-connected products, and certain demographic information about you and/or your child, such as your occupation, marital status, level of education, and annual family income, and the age, birth date, and gender of your child. VTech refers to this type of information as "Registration Data." In some cases, Registration Data may be combined and stored with your PII and/or other personal information about you and/or your children. Any Registration Data about children is collected only from adults. VTech does not knowingly ever request or collect Registration Data directly from children. 

_(c) Login Information._ To set up or access your user account through any of the Web Services, you will be required to enter your email address or username and your password. This is considered "Login Information," which allows us to identify your account and authenticate you as the user of the account. 

**2.2

Information Passively Collected.

**

VTech uses the web technologies described below to passively collect information about your visit to a Web Service. This information may include information about your computer, such as its operating system, internet protocol address ("IP Address"), and web browser. It may also include information about your VTech web-connected device and your browsing data. VTech may also collect information about your or your children's use of certain Web Services, as discussed in Section 2.4 and Section 7, below. 

_(a) Cookies._ Some of the pages on the Web Services use "cookies" to help us better serve you and other visitors to the Web Services. Cookies are brief text messages transmitted by websites to the hard drive of visitors' computers when they click on a website page. Should the visitor return to that page at a later time, the visitor's computer will transmit the text message back to the website server to permit the server to recall previous visits to that page or website or to keep track of a transaction in progress. You may set your browser to reject cookies from the Web Services and all other websites by changing the settings on your browser. Doing this, however, could diminish your ability to use the Web Services or prevent your use of certain features of the Web Services. Cookies are not linked to any PII or Registration Data. 

_(b) Action Tags._ Some of the pages of the Web Services use "action tags," which are also known as "clear GIF" or "web beacons." An action tag is an invisible tag that may be placed on certain pages of a website but not the visitor's computer. When you access pages with an action tags, those action tags generate a generic notice of that visit. Action tags are not linked to any PII or Registration Data but may be linked to your IP address. 

_(c) Log Files._ Like most companies with websites, VTech uses log files to analyze trends, administer the Web Services, track user movement and gather other information. The log files contain information such as your IP Address, browser type used, internet service provider information, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time, and number of clicks. The contents of the log files are not linked to any PII or Registration Data. 

**2.3

When VTech Collects Information.

**

VTech collects the passively collected information while a user is visiting or using the Web Services. VTech may request or require PII, Registration Data, or Login Information if you choose to participate in any of the following Web Services features: 

  * Create, log in to, or manage a Web Services account
  * Purchase a product or download a software application
  * Upload play or activity data from a VTech web-connected product (Note: additional details about this feature are provided below)
  * Register products
  * Submit reviews or testimonials about products
  * Sign-up for newsletters or other marketing promotions
  * Participate in promotions
  * Contact VTech Customer Support
  * Purchase gift certificates or other VTech products as gifts (Note: To use this feature, we may require certain PII about the recipient of your gift, such as the recipient's name, e-mail address, and shipping address to deliver the purchased item. The recipient's information is used and collected only for this purpose.)
  * Send messages about VTech products or services



**2.4**

 **More Information about Play or Activity Data from VTech Web-Connected Products and Learning Lodge.**

Certain VTech products are designed to connect to your computer for synchronization with Learning Lodge, which is a web-connected software program. When your child uses this kind of VTech product, the device will record the play activities or other actions performed on the device. This includes information about your child's duration of use, how many questions were answered, how many items were completed, and other similar play data or performance patterns. When the device is connected to your computer, this information is uploaded to the Learning Lodge program on your computer and sent to VTech via the Internet. 

A parent or guardian must set up an account to access Learning Lodge, and the parent or guardian will be asked to provide certain information about his or her child or children that will be using the VTech web-connected product, such as the child's name, birth date, and gender. To access the Learning Lodge features or connect and synchronize the VTech web-connected product, the parent or guardian must always first log in to his or her account. Thus, only the parent or guardian should be able to synchronize, upload, and submit the information from the VTech web-connected product. The play activity collected from the VTech web-connected product is used to (1) allow the adult or guardian to track the child's learning progress while using the device, and (2) recommend additional VTech products to the adult or guardian based on the child's preferences and learning progress. 

**3.

From time to time, VTech may use your PII to send email messages to you regarding your account(s), to respond to any emails or other communications you send to us, and/or to advise you of any problems with the Web Services.

These functions may include order fulfillment, package delivery, marketing assistance, postal and email delivery, customer service, data analysis, and credit processing. The third parties we contract for these purposes have limited access to your PII and Registration Data and may not use it for other purposes.

Please be aware of the fact that, in order to process your order, VTech may share your information with and transfer your information to its affiliates located in the EU and Hong Kong and billing companies located in the EU, the United States, and Hong Kong.

**4.3**

 **Testimonials and Product Reviews.**

Certain of the Web Services allow users to publicly post reviews and testimonials about VTech products and services. Although we request the user to submit his or her email address for verification purposes, we do not post this information, and we do not require the user to publicly disclose any PII to post a review or testimonial. To further protect users' PII from public disclosure, we ask them to use a screen name or nickname instead of their true name and generally provide their location in terms of city and state. Users have the option to post from a selection of standardized descriptions or post customized statements. Any information posted or shared using these features is done so at the user's own risk. If you choose to submit a review or testimonial, we encourage you not to reveal any personal information about yourself or your children that you do not want others to see.

VTech may disclose your information if we in good faith believe we are required to do so: (a) to comply with applicable law or legal proceedings, including court orders, subpoenas, statutes and regulations; (b) to protect, enforce and defend VTech's rights or property; and/or (c) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of VTech's customers, visitors or the public. 

**4.8**

 **With Your Permission.**

**5.

Protection of Your Information.

**

**5.1**

 **Transmission and Storage of Your Information.**

The security of your personal information is important to VTech, and VTech is committed to handling your information carefully. In most cases, if you submit your PII to VTech directly through the Web Services it will be transmitted to protect your privacy over a secure HTTPS connection using SSL technology. Further, VTech stores your PII and Registration Data in a database with restricted access. The information that VTech collects from you will be transferred to, and stored at, servers in the United States and Hong Kong. 

**5.2**

 **Login and Authentication.**

VTech also protects PII and Registration Data by requiring users of the Web Services to verify their identities with unique login information before they can access or edit their account information or settings. If you select and establish Login Information in connection with your use of the Web Services, or any other interaction with the Web Services, you are responsible for keeping that Login Information confidential. Do not share your Login Information with anyone else. 

**6.

Links to Other Websites.

**

The Web Services may include access or links to other, third-party websites. If you choose to visit those other sites from the Web Services, VTech is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those websites. Those third-party websites are beyond VTech's control and may not have privacy policies and security protections, or their privacy policies or security protections may not be as protective of your personal information as VTech's policies and protections. Those other websites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit personal information. We recommend that you review and understand the privacy policies of the websites you visit, whether you visit those websites directly or through a link from a page on the Web Services. VTech does not have access to or control over information collected by third-party websites. 

**7.

Information Practices Regarding Children.

**

VTech is concerned about the safety and privacy of children when they use the Internet. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. We also urge children to check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website. Our information practices regarding the collection of information from children are in accordance with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and are outlined below. 

Although VTech sells and promotes children's products, all of our products are intended to be purchased by adults. If you are under 18 years old and you want to buy something on the Web Services, you must have an adult buy it for you.
