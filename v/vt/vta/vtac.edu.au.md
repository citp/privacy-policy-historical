# VTAC Website Privacy Statement

Consistent with its obligations under the  _Information Privacy Act 2000 (Vic)_ __ and principles outlined in the  _National Privacy Policy Principles 2001_ , VTAC has a Code of Privacy and Ethics to ensure that any information provided, including identification of individuals, will be used only for the purpose(s) intended. Where the intention includes confidentiality, information will be treated as such unless otherwise required by law.

This Privacy Statement explains how your personal information (being information capable of identifying you as an individual) will be treated by VTAC.

The institutions that participate in VTAC are committed to observing the VTAC Code of Privacy and Ethics. This code is designed to protect the rights of you, the applicant, institutions and the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC).

## Associate institutions

An Associate institution is an institution that lists all of their courses in the VTAC Guide as ‘Direct to the institution’ and manages the application and offer process directly with the applicant.

As a result, all data provided by you, as part of your direct application to one of these institutions should be in accordance with that institution’s obligations under the  _Information Privacy Act 2000 (Vic)_ __ and principles outlined in the  _National Privacy Principles 2001._

_For further information about how your information is handled when you apply directly to one of these institutions, refer to each institution’s website for a copy of their privacy policy._

## VTAC institutions

### What VTAC collects and why

#### All applicants

The information we collect will include contact details, personal details, residential status, current or previous results for Australian Year 12 studies, the Victorian General Achievement Test (GAT), tertiary studies and any other tests required by participating institutions as part of their selection process.

To assist institutions with enrolments VTAC will also collect information about languages spoken at home, place of birth and ethnicity. Your responses are not used as part of the selection process but rather for the collection of governmental statistics.

On behalf of VTAC institutions we ask that you indicate whether or not you have a disability. The choice to answer this question is optional and your response is not used as part of the selection process, but rather to ensure that you have adequate access to support services.

Once you have applied we will endeavour to obtain any current or previous results for Australian Year 12 studies, the General Achievement Test (GAT), tertiary studies and any other tests required by VTAC institutions as part of their selection process directly from the respective state databases, university or testing centres.

With regard to university results, a Grade Point Average (GPA) is calculated:

  * if you undertake university studies in Australia and
  * if VTAC has been able to access the results electronically via the Automated Results Transfer Scheme (ARTS).



**Current Year 12 students**

In order to establish and maintain the VTAC applicant file and VTAC CourseLink (web based course information and counselling program), we collect personal information from the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority and its interstate equivalents on:

  * students undertaking one or more VCE units of study (or interstate equivalent) 
  * students undertaking one or more Senior VCAL units of study 
  * International Baccalaureate (IB) students (studying the IB with an Australian school). 



**What information is used?**

We will limit use of your personal information to carrying out business which includes confirming the data contained within your application, confirming past and/or current results, distributing your application to the institutions and courses to which you have applied (through VTAC), notifying you of cancelled courses, change of preference and offers.

Using the results received from the VCAA, VTAC calculates an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) for tertiary entrance for eligible VCE students and a notional ATAR for Victorian IB students.

While current and previous Year 12 results are stored on a national database, this information can only be accessed, by the Director (or nominee) of any state-based tertiary admission centre if you initiate an application with that centre for tertiary study within that state.

The Grade Point Average (GPA) will be used as stated under each published course or institutional selection mode. Refer to [GPA](http://www.wss9.vtac.edu.au/current/grade-point-averages.html) for further information.

### Who has access to your information?

#### All applicants

We distribute your personal information to institutions to which you have applied for the purpose of application, Special Entry Access Schemes, Scholarships and selection only. Institutions are not permitted to share, sell or trade your information without your express permission.

We will not share, sell or trade your personal information to any institution to which you have not applied.

We may use your information to conduct research; however at no time is personal or sensitive data made available to any person or authority outside of VTAC and its governmental responsibilities without your permission.

We do allow your information to be provided to other organisations that perform certain functions or operations for us. We bind these companies to the same privacy requirements as we do ourselves so that they cannot provide this information to anyone else.

We enforce these requirements through contractual agreements.

#### Current Year 12 Students

As the year progresses, VTAC will distribute your course preference data, ATAR (Victorian schools only), offer and enrolment details to your school for the purposes of counselling and the development of generic student reports.

If you are studying in Victoria and have been allocated an ATAR, VTAC will distribute your ATAR to the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority to assist them in confirming the Premiers Awards.
