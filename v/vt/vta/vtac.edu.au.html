<h2>3. How we collect your information</h2>
<p>VTAC collects the personal and sensitive information necessary for us to provide you with the services you have requested from us, and to manage your VTAC application.</p>
<h3>3.1 Online applications</h3>
<p>VTAC collects personal information and, in some circumstances, information regarding your health, or information about someone else, to process your application for admission to tertiary institutions. Only information that is necessary to fulfil the functions and activities VTAC will be collected. Such collection will be by lawful and fair means and will not be unreasonably intrusive.</p>
<p>Sensitive and health information will only be collected if it is directly related to the primary purpose for which the information will be collected or as required by law or with the specific and informed consent of the individual.</p>

In some cases, VTAC may collect information from a third party, such as another educational institution, other interstate Tertiary Admission Centres or a government authority such as the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority or Victoria Police. VTAC may also collect personal or sensitive information from others that you have authorised to act on your behalf such as a health practitioner, an employment agency, a former employer or contractor.</p>
<p>In providing the details of your authorised person or agency to VTAC you are consenting to the collection of your personal and sensitive information from your authorised person or agency.</p>
<p>Generally, you will be aware we have collected personal information or have authorised collection of personal information from third parties or be aware that we are obtaining information from them.</p>
<h3>3.2 Google Analytics</h3>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
<h4>Logged-in user, demographic and interest reporting</h4>
<p>VTAC uses a specific cookie to facilitate the use of Google Universal Analytics for users logged-in to the VTAC account or applications. If you are logged-in, VTAC may use a unique ID in combination with Google Analytics to track and analyse pages you view and services you use. This unique ID is distinct from your VTAC user ID. VTAC will not upload any data that allows Google to personally identify an individual (such as names, government reference numbers, email addresses, or any similar data), or data that permanently identifies a device (such as a mobile phone’s unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>VTAC has also implemented Demographics and Interest Reporting from the Google Analytics Advertising Features. VTAC will use this data to improve and expand information and services through a better understanding of visitors to our website and how they use our website. Visitors can opt out of Google’s interest-based ads or edit the interests and demographics associated with their Google Account by changing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ad settings</a>.</p>
<h4>Want to block tracking?</h4>
<p>Visitors can also block tracking by Google Analytics by installing the&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>, available for all common browsers.</p>
<h3>3.3 Google AdWords and DoubleClick</h3>
<p>We use Google AdWords and DoubleClick to advertise VTAC across a variety of third-party websites and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. AdWords or DoubleClick remarketing may serve ads to you based on your interactions with this and other websites by placing a cookie on your machine. For example, we may advertise to previous visitors to our site who haven't completed an application. This cookie does not allow us to gather personal information or provide a means to identify you. The data gathered is anonymous. We also share this information with our trusted advertising and analytics partners.</p>
<h4>Want to opt out?</h4>
<p>If you want to opt out of seeing personalised ads served by Google, you can change <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-AU">Ad Settings</a>.</p>

<h3>3.4 Facebook</h3>
<p>We use Facebook pixels to advertise VTAC on Facebook. This cookie provides us with data about ads served to users on Facebook who later visited our website. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and to target ads to you based on your previous behaviour. For example, we may show you an ad if you came to our site but did not complete an application.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of Facebook’s use of cookies and Facebook Pixel Re-Marketing through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217">settings</a> on your Facebook Account.</p>

<h2>7. How do I access my personal information?</h2>
<p>You have a right to access your personal information held by us. Much of the information provided by you will be held in your VTAC Account.</p>
<p>There are circumstances where we may refuse to give you access to some of your personal information. If we refuse to give you access, we will give you written notice of the reasons for refusal and the mechanisms available to you to complain about the refusal.</p>
<p>For example, we are not required to provide you with access where a request:</p>
<ul>
<li>is frivolous or vexatious;</li>
<li>concerns information relating to an existing or anticipated legal proceedings between VTAC and yourself;</li>
<li>requires access that would be unlawful;</li>
<li>would be likely to prejudice the prevention, investigation and prosecution of any criminal offence or seriously improper conduct.</li>

<li>An authorised nominee is a person who has been nominated by the VTAC applicant, to manage the administration of the application to which the authorised nominee's name has been assigned in circumstances where the applicant is unable to manage the administration of the application themselves.</li>
<li>For details of what an authorised nominee can and cannot access see <a href="http://www.vtac.edu.au/applying/courses/changes/authorised-nominee.html">Authorised nominee: definition, rights and responsibilities</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must take care to ensure that your data is accurate, relevant, complete and not misleading and should notify us as soon as possible after you become aware of any discrepancies. Unless we disagree with you about the accuracy or completeness of a record, we will generally correct it upon request, or suggest alternative arrangements for updating our records.</p>
