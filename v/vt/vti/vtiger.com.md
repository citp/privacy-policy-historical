## 
* How we store and secure the information we collect

### Data Security

Vtiger maintains strict administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information and data you store in your account. Access to your name and email address is restricted to the employees of Vtiger. Data stored in your account is only accessed by the Vtiger team when performing the migration, or support services.

All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.

While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

If you use our services or websites, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you submit rests with you and not Vtiger. We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of data transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.

At Vtiger, your data privacy and security are of prime importance to us. To that end, we are ISO 27001:2013 certified. If you have any concerns regarding the security of your data, please write to us at compliance@vtiger.com with any questions.

###  Data Retention

We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User’s account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:

  * the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure
  * backups are kept for 3 months
  * billing information is retained for a period of 5 years
  * information on legal transactions between Client and Vtiger is retained for a period of 5 years

If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to us by a Vtiger customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with our customer directly.
