  <h2 class="h-bravo text-center" id="transaction_communications">Transaction Communications</h2>

  <p>
    During your homebuying experience, Veterans United Home Loans works with a variety of third parties
    and affiliates to promote a better homebuying experience. Many of our clients choose to use the services
    of a real estate agent. While the choice to use a real estate agent during the transaction is an individual
    one and is not a condition for service, Veterans United Home Loans is uniquely positioned to work hand in
    hand with an agent if you choose to do so.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your real estate agent works to help you throughout your homebuying process, from shopping for the perfect
    home, all the way to helping you at the closing table. To promote a high level of service to you, Veterans
    United may provide your real estate agent with a mobile application known as AgentEdge. The AgentEdge app
    serves as a tool for your agent in order to provide transparency and encourage momentum during the loan
    process. We share specific information with your agent so that he or she may better understand your needs.
    This includes but not limited to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your contact information, including phone and email.</li>
    <li>Your loan officer and his/her team’s contact information</li>
    <li>How much you are preapproved for and the ability to generate a preapproval letter on your behalf</li>
    <li>Ability to upload documents, such as purchase contract</li>
    <li>Receive notifications when your file reaches important milestones</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Veterans United Home Loans will not communicate information to your real estate agent unless we believe
    they need to know the information to perform their duties as your agent. Veterans United clients may opt
    out of providing their agent's access to the app at any time. Clients may contact
    <a href="mailto:customerservice@veteransunited.com">customerservice@veteransunited.com</a> or alert their
    designated loan officer that they would prefer to not share the information with their agent. By submitting your
    information, you agree to allow Veterans United Home Loans to release transaction information to your
    real estate agent, if you choose to work with one.
