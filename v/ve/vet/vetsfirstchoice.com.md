We may also share your personal information collected from the Site for the following purposes:



(i) _Disclosures to Third Parties Assisting in Our Operations_. We may share your personal information under confidentiality agreements and any legally required data processing agreements with other companies that work with, or on behalf of, Vets First Choice to provide products and services, such as those who are providing email solutions, providing cloud hosting services, analyzing data and usage of the Site, or providing support and maintenance services for the Site, as well as legal, regulatory, audit and other professional advisors. These companies may use your personal information to assist us in our operations or for our legitimate business interests.  However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

  4. **Cookies and Web Beacons.** We use cookies and web beacons on our Site and in our emails to you. Cookies are unique identifiers that are transferred to your computer or mobile device to provide you with personalized features, advertising, and storage of items in your shopping basket when you are browsing the Site. Cookies may be used in many ways: they allow us to verify the login status of customers using products or services linked directly with our Site, track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our affiliate signup programs, and track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign. Cookies also allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer, enabling us to make your visit to our Site easier by recognizing you when you return and helping to provide you with a customized experience.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, you may still use our Site; however, you may have limited access to some areas within our Site. For more information on how to manage cookies, click [here](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). We also provide you with an option to opt-out of receiving certain cookies associated with our online advertising. Flash cookies are also created by certain content on our pages using Adobe® Flash®, such as product tutorials. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).  When we send you emails, we may include a web beacon to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails. When you click on a link in an email, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you.



Some of our web pages, emails, and other online content may contain electronic images known as web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible graphical images. These web beacons allow us to count users who have visited our web pages, seen our ads, or opened our email. Web beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides (the URL).

  5. **Response to “Do Not Track” Signals.** Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Vets First Choice currently does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.
  6. **Linked Sites and Social Media.** Our Site may contain links and/or references to web sites and other services operated by third party companies that we believe may be of interest to you. We do not endorse, do not control, and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party sites. Through the Site, you can also choose to access certain social media platforms that are owned and/or controlled by third parties, including, without limitation, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. When you elect to access and use any third-party website or social media platform, you will be sharing your information with those sites. The information that you share will be governed by the privacy policies and terms of service of the providers of such third-party website or social media platform. We have no control over, or liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of third-party sites, including social media, that may be enabled within and/or otherwise accessible through the Site.
  7. **Security.** The security and confidentiality of your personal information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Despite our efforts to protect your personal information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the internet will be intercepted. As part of our efforts to protect your personal information, we have taken, or have taken through our service providers, the following steps:



(i) Requiring both a personal username and a password in order for you to access your Personal Information;

(ii) Using firewalls to protect information held in our servers;

(iii) Utilizing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption in transmitting personal information to our servers.

(iv) Monitoring the limited number of personnel who have potential access to personal information; and

(v) Routinely backing up the systems to protect the integrity of personal information.

  8. **Changes to This Privacy Policy.** This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. If we update the Privacy Policy, we will let you know about our changes we consider material by placing a note on the Site or you may receive an email with notification of the updated Privacy Policy. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any personal information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Small changes or changes that do not significantly affect individual privacy interests may be made at any time and without prior notice.

(i) _Under Age 13_. We do not knowingly collect or retain personally identifiable information about persons under 13 years of age. Any person who provides their personal information to Vets First Choice via the Site represents that they are 13 years of age or older. The Site does not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.  If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online without parental consent, we will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from our databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law). If you become aware of any personally identifiable information we have collected from children under 13, please contact us at legal@vetsfirstchoice.com.

(ii) _Under Age 18_.  We do not sell products on this Site for purchase by children under the age of 18.  Children under 18 years of age may only use this Site with the authorization of a parent or legal guardian.
