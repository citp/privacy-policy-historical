WE ARE COMMITTED TO SAFEGUARDING YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE. PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY
POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.
Direct Vet Marketing, Inc. (also known as “Vets First Choice”) (hereinafter, “Vets First Choice,” “we,” “us”,
“our”) provides www.vetsfirstchoice.com (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy along with our Terms and
Conditions govern your interaction with the Site by each user (“user,” “you” or “your”), and your registration
for and use of the Site. Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use and other
published guidelines, we do not release personally identifiable information about our users without their
permission.
1. General
We do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it to us. While you
may use some of the functionality of the Site without registration, some of the activities and services might
require you to subscribe or create an account. If you do not subscribe or create an account on or through
the Site, the only information we collect will be “Non-Personal Information” (i.e., Information that is not
traceable back to you and cannot be used to identify you. Non-Personal Information includes information
such as the web pages that you have viewed) through the use of “Cookies”, which are more fully described
below. If you choose to subscribe or create an account through the Site, we may require you to submit
“Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e., Information that can be traced back to you or used to identify
you; Personally Identifiable Information includes information such as your full name, home address,
telephone number and e-mail address). You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally
Identifiable Information you submit to Vets First Choice. Inaccurate information (such as an out-of-date
email address) will affect the information you receive when using the Site and tools and our ability to contact
you.
Vets First Choice is the sole owner of information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this
information to others in ways different than what is disclosed in this policy.
2. Your Consent
BY SUBMITTING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO US, AND/OR BY USING THE SITE,
YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE SUCH PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE, AND AS
PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY LAW.
If you do not agree with these terms, do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. If you
refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required Personally Identifiable
Information, we may not be able to provide you with certain products or services that can be offered on the
Site.
3.   The Information We Gather
        Vets First Choice gathers two types of information about users:
        3.1. Non-Personal Information
        When users come to the Site, we may collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating,
        among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which the pages were visited,
        and the hyperlinks which were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves the logging of the IP
        addresses, operating system, and browser software used by each Site user. Although such
        information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we can determine from an IP address a user’s
        Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
        Cookies allow Vets First Choice to serve you better and more efficiently, personalize your experience
        with the Site and services offered on the Site, determine the length of time each user spends at any
        particular area of the Site, and ascertain the specific functionality that users choose to use. Cookies
        also may be used to facilitate a user’s log-in, but are not used to retain Personally Identifiable
        Information.
        Most browsers allow you to control how and whether Cookies will be accepted. If you reject our
        Cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of the Site may not work properly, but you do not
        have to accept our Cookies in order to use portions of the Site. For more information on how to
        configure your browser, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser.
        3.2. Personally Identifiable Information
        We collect Personally Identifiable Information from users at several different points on this site,
        including, without limitation, when you create an account, make purchases in our online store,


        provide information to our customers, utilize social media and live chat, subscribe to e-mail
        newsletters, send e-cards or e-mail to friends, participate in contests, sweepstakes and other
        promotions, or participate in online polls and surveys.
       (a) Creating an Account. In order to make purchases or access the medicine cabinet in our online
       store, we will require you to create an account with us. During this process, you will need to provide
       us with Personally Identifiable Information that may include, but may not be limited to, your first and
       last name, date of birth, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number and password. Vets
       First Choice will rely on you to self-report accurate information, and will not take steps to verify any
       information that you provide.
       (b) Making Purchases. When purchasing products or services through the Site, users are required
       to provide Vets First Choice with Personally Identifiable Information that may include, but may not be
       limited to, your first and last name, date of birth, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number,
       credit card number and expiration date. Vets First Choice uses this Personally Identifiable
       Information to process the order, send the product and/or provide the service. If the purchase is a
       gift, we may also collect information about the recipient, such as name and mailing address.
       (c) From Our Customers. You may be asked to provide certain personal information to our
       customers (e.g. your veterinarian or veterinary practice) in connection with their use of our products
       and services, such as when you order products through this site. If you choose to provide personal
       information to one of our customers, you should review the individual privacy policy of that customer.
       Our customers may upload contact information they have collected through other means. This
       information may contain third party personal information. Vets First Choice is not responsible for the
       privacy practices of our customers.
       (d) Subscribing to Newsletters. You may subscribe to e-mail newsletters offered by us. When you
       subscribe to our e-mail newsletter(s), we may ask for your first and last name, e-mail address, age, or
       gender.
        (e) Participating In Contests, Sweepstakes and Other Promotions. From time to time, Vets First
       Choice may offer you the opportunity to participate in a contest, sweepstakes, rewards program or
       other promotion through the Site (each, a “Promotion”). If you desire to participate in any such
       Promotion, you will be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such
       Promotion, and your participation will be subject to the Terms of Use for this Site and any other rules
       applicable to such Promotion and posted on the Site. Information collected in connection with a
       Promotion may include, among other things, your and your pet’s name, date of birth, mailing address,
       e-mail address and phone number.
       (f) Participating in Online Polls and Surveys. Vets First Choice may, from time to time, utilize
       online polls and/or surveys. If you desire to participate in any such online poll or survey, you may be
       asked to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, or you may be asked to provide only
       information that is not personally identifiable (such as first name only, city or state of residence, age,
       gender, or dog breed owned).

        event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to a third
        party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate law or a court order. Vets First
        Choice reserves the right to report any suspected illegal activity to, and cooperate with, law

       by Vets First Choice or any third parties unless you elect to receive additional information and
       promotional material from Vets First Choice and/or third parties. If a third party administers the
       Promotion, your participation may be subject to that third party's terms and conditions, and privacy
       policy. Detailed information about these terms will be provided on the applicable form you will be

       Vets First Choice consultants and contractors (“Consultants”) sometimes have limited access to your
       Personally Identifiable Information in the course of providing products or services to Vets First
       Choice. These Consultants include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services,
       and/or content related to better operation and maintenance of the Site. Unless you have opted-out of
       receiving e-mails and newsletters from Vets First Choice, these Consultants also may have access to
       your e-mail address to send newsletters to you on our behalf. Access to your Personally Identifiable
       Information by these Consultants is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the
       Consultants to perform its limited function for Vets First Choice. We also contractually require that
       our Consultants not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other
       than providing us with products and services, and that the Consultants secure your Personally
       Identifiable Information with safeguards equivalent to our own safeguards.
