‘Personal information’ we collect means any recorded information that can identify someone and this includes your name, address, telephone numbers, date of birth, e-mail address, credit card details for payment of fees, passport details and photographic, video or audio recordings of you.

‘Health information’ we collect means health information as defined in the Health Records Act 2001 (Vic) and includes information that can be linked to an individual, that is about their physical, mental or psychological health, or disability status.

Information that is collected will be held securely to prevent any security breaches.
