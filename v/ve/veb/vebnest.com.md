**Abuse Reports**  
We know for having lots of scam and fraudulant activities, most of the hosted customers face several unconscious abuse report(s). We therefore, tried to create a powerful abuse team to verify the abuse reports (Copyright, Email Spam, Unauthorised Activities) sent to us. We first verify the reporters identity and then verify the existence of copyrighted material according to our company law. A reporter has to send a paper with the compnay header signed by him/her/company’s MD to prove the copyright authorisation. According to MLA, only Abuse Department (Or Piracy Department) of the related company/personal is only allowed to send an abuse request to our Department for verification. If its a personal copyright, then a Passport identity including his/her copyright over the material has to be proven to our abuse department. All the documents are verified according to our law and MLA. If Abuse passes the request to Support, then support department asks the owner to take proper action against the complaint. If support doesn’t receive proper information(s) from client then a suspention is issued after 15 days of escalation. This steps are only taken to prevent fradulant scam reports and reduce the activities of support to verify the abuse report. For Email spamming a proper header is required so that its possible to do a network scan and find out the verification of the email sender. For any Abuse report please contact our Abuse department using the contact provided here: http://www.vebnest.com/contact.php
