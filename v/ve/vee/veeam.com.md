## Cookies

Cookies, web beacons and similar tracking technologies are used to enhance user experience.

It is worth a note that a cookie cannot retrieve any information from your hard drive, infect your computer with viruses or steal your personal data or in any other way impair your privacy.

A web beacon is a small and generally hidden GIF-image that is incorporated into a web page or an email to keep track on user’s activity on the page or the email. Just like a cookie, a beacon tracks user’s visit and sends the data to the server that is the only to be able to decrypt this data. But unlike cookie, a beacon can not be used for identification purposes, nor can it store any data on your computer as it is not browser-based.
