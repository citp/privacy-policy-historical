# Veetle

Nothing is more important to Veetle than protecting the private information of visitors to our site. Below you'll find information about our commitment to ensuring the privacy of your and your children's personally identifiable information (such as your full name, address, email address, telephone number and/or other identifying information) and preserving the integrity of the medium.

Please read the following carefully. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at Veetle, Inc, 261 Hamilton Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301.

## Gathering and Use of Information

Veetle will never willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our online audience to any third party without first receiving the user's permission. We do not collect personally identifiable information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis.

Visitors to the Veetle Web Site may voluntarily supply certain personally identifiable information in connection with (i) subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as email newsletters), (ii) requests for membership information and (iii) e-commerce transactions. In addition, personally identifiable information is voluntarily provided in connection with certain content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting.

Veetle may use such information only for conducting the activities stated above. For more information regarding Veetle's policies on the handling and use of Veetle's membership list, please see Veetle's Membership List Policy. The extent of such use is always explained at the time a site visitor provides such information. If the visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for the disclosed internal purposes, the visitor is given an opportunity to 'opt-out.' Our visitors need to recognize, however, that under certain circumstances, if they select to 'opt-out' they may not be eligible for certain activities for which the personally identifiable information is needed. (For example, if a forum or bulletin board participant elects to 'opt-out' on permitting us to collect and use their personal information, they cannot use the forums or bulletin boards.)
