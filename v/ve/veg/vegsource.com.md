**Data Collection and Opt Out**

Our advertisers, as well as most sites on the Internet, may from time to time use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. These cookies cannot be used to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why are they used? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time our ad server serves you an ad. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps our ad server target ads to you. This cookie can help ensure that we don't serve you the same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for our server to deliver you an ad. 

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.
