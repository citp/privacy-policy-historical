**Privacy Policy**

VEGAS.com takes the privacy of our readers very seriously. On this page, we have tried to address some of the main privacy concerns that you might have. If you have additional questions that are not answered here, please write us at this address: [webmaster@vegas.com](mailto:webmaster@vegas.com).

 **Information we gather**

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our web sites. We also collect data on pages that readers access or visit and information volunteered by readers, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used for internal review and use. Unless otherwise stated, all information collected will be solely used to improve the content of our site and services.

We share aggregate information with advertisers regarding the demographics of our visitors. This demographic information is collected from voluntary surveys taken by visitors to VEGAS.com or affiliate sites. We only share individual information regarding your profile **when you have authorized us to do so,** via a checkbox labeled "VEGAS.com may make the information that I supplied available to selected companies so that they may contact me regarding products or services that may be of interest to me." Again -- we will only share your information when you have given us permission to do so.

We only send direct e-mail to readers who sign up for one of our mailing lists or who agree to future contact regarding special promotions and offers from VEGAS.com. We only want to send you mail that you wish to receive. All of our mail contains clear information on how to unsubscribe, and we honor all requests as quickly as possible. If you are receiving mail and wish to unsubscribe, either follow the unsubscribe instructions in the mail or contact us by sending e-mail to [webmaster@vegas.com](mailto:webmaster@vegas.com), by calling us at the telephone number at the end of this page or by writing to us at the below address and telling us that you do not want to receive e-mail from our company.

If you supply us with your postal address online you will only receive the information you specifically request -- never any unsolicited mail.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online.

 **What about cookies?**

Our site uses persistent cookies, which are small pieces of data stored by your computer and used to randomly identify individual users. This helps us ensure that you won't see the same advertisements too often and allows us to better estimate the size of our readership. We do not use cookies to store personal information about users or to track users' movement through our sites.

The U.S. Department of Energy's Computer Incident Advisory Capability has issued an information bulletin stating that privacy advocates' fears over the use of cookies -- a popular technique for tracking Web site visitors -- are unfounded. The claims that Web cookies may be used to gather information on "passwords, credit card numbers, and a list of the software on your computer" is not even "close to the truth," according to the bulletin. In fact, information that is gathered via cookies -- usually a user's numerical Internet address, browser type and operating system -- can also be recorded in a Web server's log files. "Cookies just make it easier. [A server] cannot find out your name or e-mail address, or anything about your computer using cookies," says the bulletin.
