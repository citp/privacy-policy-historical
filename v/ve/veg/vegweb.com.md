**Information collected and how it is used**  
VegWeb will use reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure or use of your personal information. We will not sell, share, or rent your information in any way different from what is disclosed in this statement. VegWeb collects information from you at several different points on our website. This information is used to enhance your experience on VegWeb and as described below.

**We collect information in the following areas:**

**I. Membership**   
VegWeb does not collect your personal identifiable information unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. If you wish to use certain features on www.vegweb.com, you must first complete an online membership form. Such features are, but not limited to: 

  * Recipe, Article, and Book Comments
  * Discussion Boards
  * Grocery List, Meal Planner, Recipe Box
  * Contests and Promotions
  * Member Profiles

During membership registration you are required to give contact information (such as your name and email address). This information is used to provide the services that you have requested, or to contact you about the service on our site for which you have expressed interest. We may contact you from time to time with news. 

**Contests and Promotions**  
You must be a member in order to enter contests and promotions on VegWeb. Participation in these events is completely voluntary and we do not require you to disclose information. Information requested may include contact information (such as your name and shipping address) and demographic information. Your contact information will be used to notify you if you've won and to award prizes. 

**II. Recipe Submission**  
Your personally identifying information may be used for editorial purposes (such as attributing your submitted recipe to you). We may also use this information to contact you should we have any complications with your recipe. 

**III. Mailing Lists**  
There are two different kinds of mailing lists that are available at VegWeb, moderated lists and discussion lists. The moderated lists are the VegWeb Monthly Newsletter and VegWeb Weekly Recipes (html and text versions). These lists are hosted at [www.YourMailingListProvider.com](http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/) and are subject to the privacy policy there.

All of the other mailing lists are discussion lists and are hosted via Yahoo. If you use an unmoderated discussion list by sending an e-mail message to the list, your e-mail address will be made public to everyone on list. This is typical in discussion lists and is done so that people can reply directly to you with in regards to your orginal message. For more information, please read [Yahoo's privacy policy](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/).

**IV. Cookies**   
Like most web sites, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. We may place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, however the "cookie" contains only your membership username and encrypted password. The "cookie" does not extract any information off your computer. We use the "cookie" to allow you access to use the features on our site which require membership.

If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited from accessing the features of our site which require membership.

Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site. See [Third Party Advertising](https://web.archive.org/misc/privacy.shtml#third)

**V. Log Files and IP addresses**  
Each time a VegWeb page is requested from your browser, we log your computer's IP address into our log files. Your computer has been pre-assigned a 12-digit number. This number is the IP address. We use your IP address to analyze trends, administer the site, track your movements on the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. When you use the Q&A, we encrypt your IP address and include it in your post. This is to help prevent spam. Occasionally, we may have to include your unencrypted IP address in your post.

In addition, moderators of the Discussion Boards can view your IP address if you sign up as a member of VegWeb.

**VI. Polls and Surveys**  
From time to time our site requests information from you via polls and surveys. This information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Polls and surveys may also be used to determine how you and other users of VegWeb feel about various issues. Participation is completely at your discretion.

**Third Party Advertising**  
We use Linkshare and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads and to provide broad demographic information for better advertisement targeting. Privacy issues surrounding Linkshare's use of certain non-personally identifiable user information by its technology are discussed in Linkshare's privacy policy, and are the sole responsibility of Linkshare. That policy can be viewed on Linkshare's [Privacy Policy page](http://www.linkshare.com/privacy.html).
