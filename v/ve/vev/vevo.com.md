By visiting, accessing or otherwise using the Services, you affirmatively consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

2. **INFORMATION WE COLLECT.**

C. **Information Collected Through Automatic Data Collection.** Our Services include features that automatically collect certain Information such as a unique device identifier assigned to your Device (“ _UDID_ ”), Third Party Platform anonymous identifiers, your Internet protocol (IP) address (if applicable), location data, and other Information regarding your use of the Services to assist us in authenticating your usage and/or Device, keeping track of your preferences, creating a more tailored user experience, better serving your particular interests and needs, etc. The Services and/or third parties may use "cookies," (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your hard drive), "embedded scripts", and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, " _Tracking Technologies_ ") to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Services. Some cookies are used to make login to our Services easier (such as by remembering your User ID).
