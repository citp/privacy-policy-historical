### How we use cookies

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

On the Velaro website, we use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website to tailor it to customer needs. We use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. Cookies also enable us to improve the performance of our messaging products by capturing your preferences. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

The Velaro live chat platform uses cookies to track the account, chat window state, visitor ID, engagement ID, queue status, and stage of the chat. Cookies are not associated with any personal information and are only used to track the transaction status of the visitor.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of our websites and products.

### Links to other websites

Our website or products may contain links to enable you to visit other websites or third party applications easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over other websites or applications.

### Consent

  * Velaro live chat is an application that is installed on Controller websites. It is the responsibility of the Controller to assert an acknowledgment of consent agreement from visitors to process live chat data.

  * The Controller may need to update their website cookie policy to specify the function of Velaro cookies on their website.



### Access & Portability
