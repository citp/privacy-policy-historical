#### Information Collected on Velocify Internet Sites and How It May Be Used

When you access and use a Velocify Internet Site, there are 3 ways we may collect information about you:

#### 1\. Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser

Velocify collects information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name of your operating system (such as Macintosh ® or Windows ®) and the name and version of your browser (such as Internet Explorer ® or FireFox ®). The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. We use this information to create statistics that help us improve our sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our Internet visitors

#### 2\. Information Collected By Placing a “Cookie” On Your Computer

Velocify may obtain information about you by installing a “tag” on your computer’s hard drive. This tag is known as a “cookie.” All of our Velocify Internet Sites use “session cookies.” A session cookie is used to tag your computer with a computer-generated, unique identifier when you access our site. A session cookie does not identify you personally and expires after you close your browser. We use session cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use our sites’ which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information in statistical form to better understand our visitor’s interests and needs to improve the content and functionality of our sites.

Some Velocify Internet sites also use “persistent cookies.” These cookies do not expire when you close your browser; they stay on your computer until you delete them. By assigning your computer a unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences, and in situations where these choices or preferences need to be collected again, they can be provided by us automatically, saving you time and effort.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit a Velocify Internet Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the site if your browser rejects our cookies.

#### 3\. Information You Knowingly and Voluntarily Provide

Velocify collects the information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use a Velocify Internet Site, for example, the information you provide when you sign up to receive email alerts, when you complete a survey, or when you ask us a question or email us with feedback. In many cases this information will be personal information. Velocify uses this information for the purposes for which you provide it. We may also use the information we collect on Velocify Internet Sites for various business purposes such as customer service, fraud prevention, market research, improving our products and services, and providing you and your company with information and offers we believe may be of interest to you. We may also remove all the personally identifiable information and use the rest for historical, statistical or scientific purposes.

#### Sharing Personal Information

Velocify will not sell personal information collected from its Internet sites to mailing list brokers or other third parties. Velocify may share your personal information with third parties we hire to perform services for us. These third parties are required to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf and to treat your personal information as strictly confidential. In some cases, Velocify may share your personal information with third parties who partner with us to provide products and services to our customers. When we do so, we will require our business partners to use the personal information we share with them in a manner consistent with the purposes for which it was originally collected (or to which you subsequently consented) and only as permitted under this Policy, any applicable Country or Web Site Privacy Statements, and all applicable privacy and data protection laws. In certain, limited circumstances we may share or transfer personal information to unrelated third parties. For example, we may provide personal information to a third party (i) at your request; (ii) to comply with a legal requirement or court order; (iii) to investigate a possible crime, such as identity theft; (iv) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of Velocify or a Velocify business unit; or (v) under similar circumstances. If such an event occurs, we will take appropriate steps to protect your personal information.

#### Security of Personal Information

Your personal information will generally be stored in Velocify databases or databases maintained by our service providers. Most of these databases are stored on servers located in the United States. To the extent required by law, if your personal information will be transferred outside your country an appropriate notice will be provided. Velocify maintains reasonable safeguards to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personal information. For example, we use secure socket layer (SSL) technology to transfer personal information over the Internet. Although we use security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, misuse or alteration, as is the case with all computer networks linked to the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security beyond our reasonable control.
