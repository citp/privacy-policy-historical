Last Updated on November 16, 2008

**VeloNation does not send Spam or sell email addresses.**

**About VeloNation and the Information We Collect**

**Profile Information submitted by Members to VeloNation**

VeloNation is an online social networking community that connects cyclists through networks of friends for communicating, sharing and meeting other cyclists. To accomplish this, each VeloNation Member creates his or her own user profile, which contains the personal information that the Member chooses to include. This personal information includes such things as:

·  The name of the member

·  Gender, age, martial status and other, similar personal information, 

·  Occupation, 

·  Location (e.g., city and state), and 

·  Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.

**Other Information submitted by Members to VeloNation**

VeloNation also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify Members, send notifications related to the use of the VeloNation services and conduct market research and marketing for VeloNation's internal use only. You should also be aware that Members may reveal other personal information while communicating on other areas of the VeloNation website, e.g., while participating in discussions on VeloNation Forums and/or posting information on VeloNation Blogs, news stories, videos, and photos. This information, in turn, might be viewed by other Members or visitors to the VeloNation website who are not Members.

**Information Not Directly Submitted by Members or Other Website Users to VeloNation**

Finally, we also collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the VeloNation website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.

**Use of Information Obtained by VeloNation**

**Sharing by Members of Profile Information**

The personal information of a Member contained in his or her profile will be shown to those people whom the Member chooses. Each Member has two options when choosing the level of sharing of his or her complete profile. They are:

·  "Friends" which consists only of that Member's friends, and

·  "VeloNation Members" which means all members on the VeloNation website will have limited access to general profile information. 

**PLEASE NOTE THAT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION A MEMBER CHOOSES TO INCLUDE IN HIS OR HER PROFILE, OR WHAT LEVEL OF SHARING HE OR SHE CHOOSES, CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT EACH MEMBER WILL BE INCLUDED IN THAT MEMBER'S "PUBLIC PROFILE," WHICH IS AN ABBREVIATED VERSION OF A VELONATION PROFILE CONTAINING THE UPLOADED PHOTO, THE LOCATION, AND THE USER’S NAME.   IN ORDER FOR A VISITOR TO **

**Display of Members' Information**

Members will go by their legal name and a member's email address and full name will be used in the following circumstances:

·  When the Member invites a friend via email to become a VeloNation Member, 

·  When a user or member shares a page on the website with the email to friend functionality,

·  When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the other Member to his or her friend list,

·  When a Member subscribes to a section on the website, (i.e. - user forums, profile posts, news or blog comments, etc)

·  When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the VeloNation service or VeloNation website, and 

·  If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the VeloNation service or the VeloNation website. 

Except when inviting or adding friends or as otherwise expressly set forth herein, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on VeloNation with each other through the VeloNation private messaging service, without disclosing email addresses.

However, VeloNation may share profile information and aggregate usage information of the VeloNation services in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties which may be used for research, or in order to present to Members and other users of the VeloNation website more targeted advertising, products and services; provided that, in such situations, we will never disclose information that would personally identify you.
