# Inside Communications Privacy Policy

This policy was created on May 2, 2001. Please take a few moments to review it.

We will not sell, rent or lease your email address to third parties. And we won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with any of our sites or to provide other personally identifying information.

Our relationship with you is something that we value and respect. You are the core of our business. Any goals of long-term success as a company will go unmet if we disappoint readers and customers in how they're treated. 

This policy covers all Web sites produced by Inside Communications, Inc, including _VeloNews.com_ , _Inside Triathlon.com_ , _VeloGear.com_ and _VeloSwap.com_. It also includes our magazine subscription sites. This policy does not cover information collected on sites linked from Inside Communications sites. 

**Visitor Data and Email collection:**  
Inside Communications only collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you register for our services, enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey or subscribe to our magazines, you are asked to provide information such as your email address, name, or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. 

Inside Communications uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to one of our magazines, we will use your email address to send you a confirmation notice. We may also use this information to send you regular email newsletters, inform you about new features, products or services, or other changes to the services. If you do not wish to receive email communications from us, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within every email message we send. 

From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions on our sites. If you enter one of these promotions, you'll have to provide information about yourself (such as your name and email address) so that we can contact you if you win. We may share this information -- if you give us that permission on the contest or sweepstakes entry -- with any co-sponsor of the promotion, which we will identify in the official rules. 

There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Inside Communications and may be shared with other Web sites within our family of Web sites. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Web sites. 

We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that allows us to let you join the VeloNews Tech Talk Forum without having to enter your password for each visit. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited by users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our sites. 

When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our Web sites -- it is always in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our sites. 

We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. Any third party that has access to our database for this purpose is bound by the terms set forth in this policy. There may also be occasion when we are legally required to provide access to our database in order to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose. 

**Mailing Addresses:**  
Postal addresses are used to promote Inside Communications products and services, and may be rented to selected outside firms for promotional purposes. Offers for which the names are rented are screened, and renters are required to target their offers carefully.

**Telephone Numbers:**  
Telephone numbers of Inside Communications customers will only be used by Inside Communications to notify customers of current subscription or order status. We will not rent or sell telephone numbers to any third party.

Subscribers or applicants who do not want their names used in any of the above ways may write to us at:

**Inside Communications, Inc.**  
1830 North 55th St.  
Boulder, CO 80301-2730

Or click [here](mailto:vn-subs@insideinc.com) to email us your request.

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; notice of changes will appear on this page, so check back often. Any such changes will be prospective, never retroactive. 

If you have concerns or questions about any aspect of this policy, please email our Privacy Policy Coordinator at [privacy@insideinc.com](mailto:privacy@insideinc.com). We welcome your feedback. You can also send us regular mail at the following address:
