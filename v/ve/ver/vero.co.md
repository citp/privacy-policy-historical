# Privacy Policy — VERO™ – True Social

Welcome to Vero True Social, the online and mobile service of Vero Labs, Inc. (“ **Vero** ,” “ **we** ,” or “ **us** ”).  Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Use](https://vero.co/terms-of-use).

Our Privacy Policy is designed to be accessible and honest about our privacy practices and principles. That’s why we provided the plain-English explanation of the Privacy Policy to the right. While the explanation is not part of the legal Privacy Policy (and therefore non-binding), we hope it will help you navigate this policy more easily. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Service, please contact us at any time at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8aca9bca9b8baa1bea9abb188beadbaa7e6aba7). 

For the purposes of EU data protection laws ("Data Protection Legislation"), Vero is the data controller (i.e. the company which is responsible for, and controls the processing of, your personal data). 

LEGAL TERMS OF USE 

**_What Information We Collect From You:_ Information you provide us directly:** We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, phone number and email address when you register for a Vero account or if you correspond with us. We may also collect your photo and government ID to validate your identity, if you have asked us to do so such as if you request to verify your account. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect User Content you post to the Service. User Content can be made publicly available if you choose to do so - we operate a feature that allows you to share a link to your profile where your posts can be viewed publicly by non-users of the Service. We may also allow you to provide us your log-in credentials for third-party services (like Twitter) so that you can post information from the Service onto the third-party service. 

**Inviting a contact to use Vero from the “Add Contacts” feature:** If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, we may access and collect information from your address book available on your mobile device and/or your email account, with your permission, in order to find your contacts on the Service. You understand that by inviting a contact to Vero through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication. 

**Adding Contacts on the Service:** If you choose, you can find people you know with Vero accounts through our “Add Contacts” feature or by searching names and usernames on Vero. The “Add Contacts” feature may allow you to choose to find contacts either through your address book or through a search of names and usernames on Vero. If you choose to add your contacts through your address book, then you agree to provide Vero access to your address book such that we can regularly perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide (including new contacts as you add them) is using Vero. If you choose to add your contacts through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to us to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on those sites. If you choose to add your contacts through a search of names or usernames then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on our Service. 

WHAT WE’RE SAYING 

You provide information about yourself when you sign up for an account, including your name and email-address. When you communicate through the Service, we may keep copies of those communications. You can also provide content to display on the Service. You may also provide us your credentials for third-party services (like Twitter) so you can post information from our Service onto those other services. 

You can expand your Vero network on the Service by inviting your contacts in your address book and by finding existing users through the search function on the Service. When you invite your contacts in your address book, you give Vero permission to access your address book and send invitation emails or texts from your phone to those contacts you choose to invite to the Service and _only those contacts._

 **Information we may receive from third parties:** We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Vero application, linking your account to the Vero Service, etc., a third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Vero. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your address book, your contacts’ user IDs, and your connection to those contacts, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to add your contacts on the Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your contacts join Vero. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Vero Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service. 

When you interact with us and our accounts on third-party services, we may receive information about you from those third parties. You can control the information we receive through the settings on those third-party services or by unlinking your Vero account from those third-party services.

Remember, our Service allows you to connect with others and share information about yourself with other individuals. Your profile information, including your name, photo and other personal information you include in your bio, will be available publicly to other members of the Service by default. In addition, any User Content that you upload to the Service can be made publicly available if you choose to do so - we operate a feature that allows you to share a link to your profile, where your posts can be viewed publicly by non-users of the Service. This feature only works if you have made your profile or posts public. By using the Service, you consent to have your profile information displayed to other members of the Service. Consider your own privacy and personal safety when logging in to our Service and sharing your information with anyone. Vero never shares your phone number and email address with other users on the Service without your consent.

To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information; and 

• With other members of the Service so that you can be “found” on the Service. When other members of the Service attempt to “Add Contacts” on the Service using their address book or by name search or user ID, we will identify you as an existing member of the Service if your contact information is in your friend’s address book. Similarly, we will let you know which of your contacts in your address book are already members of the Service based on the contact information associated with the member’s account. 

When we grant these necessary third parties access to your personal information, we require that they use your personal information solely in accordance with the rights granted to us and restrictions placed on us in this Privacy Policy.
