# Vertex42 Privacy Policy

This document sets forth the Vertex42 LLC Online Privacy Policy for Vertex42.com (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site. 

#### Basic Privacy

Vertex42.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our online visitors. We only collect personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, when it is necessary for processing an online payment, to complete a subscription to one of our newsletters, or register with our forum. We will never sell, trade, or give your personal information to other companies or organizations. (See below for more information about payment processing, newsletters, and forum registration).

#### Payment Processing

Online visitors who wish to purchase a product or membership from our Web site must provide their name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card number and expiration date. However, Vertex42.com does not collect this information. All credit card transactions occur over a secure connection through [ClickBank](http://www.clickbank.com/). In some cases, we use [PayPal](http://paypal.com/) to accept payments. Vertex42.com does not store credit card information. A record of sales, including names and email addresses is maintained in order to provide technical assistance or process refunds. This information is only accessible by members of our staff.

#### Newsletter Subscriptions

Online visitors who ask to be on our mailing lists and/or receive periodic email announcements provide their name and email address. We use a confirmed opt-in subscription process, to prevent a person from subscribing someone without their permission. Anyone who wishes can choose to be removed from our mailing list at any time, by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the newsletter(s), or contacting Vertex42.com directly and asking to be removed.

#### Site Usage Statistics

Our server keeps a log of site usage statistics which involves keeping track of numbers of hits on various pages, IP addresses, and the sites from which a visitor is referred. For example, if you find our site through a search engine, our logs will show that a visitor clicked through to our site from that search engine. Such information is used to verify the effectiveness of marketing efforts for our newsletters and products. It may also be used to help interested parties determine the number of visitors who find our site through their sites. In other cases, site statistics are provided to potential advertisers and link partners. _These statistics cannot be used to identify an individual, since they do not include any personal information._

#### Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. Vertex42.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:

  * Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc. 
  * Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 
  * Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.
