          <h3>Company Practices </h3>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>The following statement describes the overall  company practices of Veremedia, including advertising on our network of  websites, as well as across other internal sites, and products and services  that are offered by Veremedia. This policy does not apply to the practices of  companies that Veremedia does not own or control, or to people that Veremedia  does not employ. </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><br>
         </p>
          <h3>Information Collected  by Veremedia </h3>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><strong>Non-Personally  Identifiable Consumer Data</strong><br>
         </p>
         <p>Veremedia delivers advertisements across  multiple channels and media, including to web surfers who visit any of the  thousands of websites that are a part of Veremedia's network. With respect to  individuals who visit those sites, we, and/or one or more of our third party  advertising technology vendors, may collect what is known as "Click Stream  Data." Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes information such as a  web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date  and time, domain type, and responses by a web surfer to an advertisement  delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a  third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of  technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web  beacons (1x1 pixels). &nbsp;In addition to the  Click Stream Data collected across our web network, Veremedia owns numerous  websites and services, and often runs promotions and sweepstakes offers through  various Internet channels (collectively referred to as "Veremedia  Properties"), and collects information at those sites. As a part of the  registration process at the Veremedia Properties, we may request and collect  additional non-personally identifiable information about the visitor. Examples  of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include age,  gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred  to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together,  can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual. Web surfers may elect  not to provide Click Stream Data by following the Cookie Opt-Out procedures set  forth below. In addition, web surfers who have provided registration data to Veremedia  may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being used  for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the Data  Opt-Out procedures set forth below. Personally identifiable information that is  collected at the Veremedia Properties is discussed immediately below.</p>
         <p><br>
             <strong>Personally  Identifiable Consumer Data</strong><br>
         </p>
         <p>At some of the Veremedia Properties, we ask  people to register and provide personally identifiable data. Veremedia is  committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all  consumers before the personally identifiable data is collected, and that they  have opted-in to our use of their data. Examples of personally identifiable  data that may be requested include name, address, and email address. Web  surfers who have provided personally identifiable data may elect to have their  data deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than  for the service requested, by following the Data Opt-Out procedures set forth  below.</p>
         <p><br>
             <strong>Other Information that  is Collected</strong><br>
         </p>
         <p>At some Veremedia Properties, including this  one, Veremedia collects personal information on individuals and companies who  want to enter into business relationships with Veremedia ("business  information"). An example of this would include web publishers who want to  become a part of Veremedia's web network. We maintain business information for  purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information,  sending payments, etc. We may share business information with third parties who  provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the  confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to  law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p> <strong>How Collected  Information is Used</strong> </p>
         <p>The non-personally identifiable data that Veremedia  and/or its third party advertising technology vendors collect are used for  marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements to people across  the different websites they visit. Veremedia may also use the non-personally  identifiable data to better target content to individuals in an effort to  create a personally relevant experience for each person. The data are also used  to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform  best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals. If a  consumer elects to provide Veremedia with personally identifiable data, we may  utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be  combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting  ads to that consumer's preferences and behaviors, and for other Veremedia sales  and marketing efforts.</p>
         <p><br>
             <strong>Sharing With Third  Parties</strong></p>
         <p> All personally identifiable data provided by  individuals is maintained in confidence by Veremedia. There are instances,  however, in which personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable  information is shared with third parties, as described below. The  non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of Veremedia  on an anonymous basis.<br>
           With respect to personally identifiable  information, Veremedia may, from time to time, provide information to certain  third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing  administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other  services related to providing an Veremedia product or service. Any third-party  vendor so used will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Veremedia.<br>
           Veremedia may also share personally  identifiable information with third parties who enter into business  relationships with us. These business partners may include financial service  providers (including credit bureaus and insurance agents); non-financial  companies (including retailers, online and offline advertisers, membership list  vendors, direct marketers and publishers); companies that perform marketing  services on our behalf, and others such as non-profit organizations. We may  also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar  services as the original service signed up for, if we decide to stop providing  such services ourselves. In such situations, we will provide our subscribers  with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that Veremedia  is very careful about which companies it does business with.<br>
           In addition to the above, there is also the  possibility that Veremedia, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased  by, or merged with, another company. If that's the case, the acquiring (or  merging) company will have access to your information.<br>
           Finally, Veremedia may share information on  individuals as it deems necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate  with government and law enforcement officials.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><strong>Security Precautions</strong></p>
         <p> Veremedia makes significant efforts to  maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. We use various  technologies, including, in certain instances, encryption, to ensure the high  security standards. Any data that is stored on Veremedia's servers is treated  as confidential and is not generally available to the public. Veremedia has an  internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and  other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe  need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. Please  keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium.  Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the  possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist.</p>

          <h3>Privacy Policy:  Opting-out </h3>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><strong>Data Opt-Out</strong></p>
         <p>If a consumer elects to provide Veremedia with  personally identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us not to make  some of the uses of such data described in the Veremedia Privacy Policy, or may  have such data deleted in its entirety. Simply contact us and provide the name  of the service for which you provided information and let us know what level of  opt-out you would like to exercise. These include: (1) Do not share information  about me with business partners, (2) Do not solicit me with special offers  other than those related to the service I signed up for, (3) Remove my data  from your database for such service completely. Once we receive this  instruction, we will promptly take corrective action. Please note that we will  need you to provide your email address or other previously provided personal  identifier in order to identify you in the Data Opt-Out process. Also, please  remember that if you choose to delete your information completely you will no  longer receive the Veremedia service in question. </p>
         <p>&nbsp; </p>
         <p><strong>Cookie Opt-Out</strong> </p>
         <p>The use of "cookie" files has become  an industry standard for many, if not most, of the thousands of companies doing  business on the Internet. Like these other companies, Veremedia and its third  party advertising technology vendor also use cookies in an effort to provide a  more meaningful web-surfing experience to Internet users. Cookies are text  files that are placed by a client server onto the browser of a visitor to a  website. These files are harmless to your computer, and can store navigation  information as you move throughout the website. The cookie information can only  be read by the server that authored the cookie, and provides no personally  identifiable information about the individual who is using the computer (only  the computer used to access the Web through what is known as the IP address).  Cookies perform many important and useful functions: they help website owners  determine which sections of their sites are more appealing to their visitors;  they help speed the web experience by eliminating the need to enter user names  and passwords constantly; they make it possible to provide personalized pages  for the visitor; they help advertisers avoid repeatedly serving the same ads to  the same visitor; and they help advertisers learn which advertisements are of  interest to visitors. Veremedia and its third party advertising technology  vendor use cookie files to collect anonymous web-surfing information, known as  Click Stream Data, on web surfers who visit websites in our web network, and  who respond to advertisements that we show. None of the Click Stream Data is  personally identifiable. Collecting the Click Stream Data assists us in  delivering targeted and more relevant advertising messages to web surfers. As  you can tell from above, cookies serve many useful purposes for the Internet  community. Nevertheless, Veremedia firmly believes that every individual who  uses the Internet should be able to make informed decisions with respect to  individual privacy matters, including the use of cookies. One way to prevent  the use of cookies is through adjusting the preferences on your Internet  browser. Most browsers permit you to remove cookies that have been previously  stored, as well as prevent the future use of cookies. <br>
           The information that our third party  advertising technology vendors log on our behalf is not personally identifiable  to our vendors. To opt out of any of our advertising technology vendors'  cookie(s), please go to the Third Party Advertising Technology Vendor section  of our Privacy Policy, and click on the link for the specific vendor.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><strong>Opting-Out</strong><br>
         </p>
        <p>The following procedure works for cookies  served by Veremedia servers only. By clicking below you can request an  "opt-out cookie," which is an identification tag that will prevent  your anonymous data from being matched to any particular machine. Please note  that this opt-out process will erase the cookie ID but not the cookie. It's  necessary for us to store this "opt-out" cookie on your computer in  order to recognize you as an opt-out user. This is the only way Veremedia can  know you've chosen to take this action, and ensure that your decision is  recognized by our servers. Please note that if you ever clean out cookies from  your internal drive you will need to visit the Veremedia site again and repeat  this quick procedure. Also, please be aware that should you change computers,  have different browsers, have different computers, update your Internet browser  or delete your cookie, you should repeat this opt-out process. </p>
         <p></p>
         <p><br>
             <strong>Are There Any  Drawbacks to Opting-Out?</strong><br>
           Veremedia believes that providing targeted and  relevant content to Internet users enhances the web-surfing experience. If you  decide to opt-out, it will affect our ability to provide you with such  advertising content, and will prevent us from controlling the frequency with  which you may view particular advertisements.</p>
