**2\. How we use information we collect**

We collect personal information about you through the Sites to communicate with you, to the extent permitted by applicable law, about our solutions, products, services, promotions, company, and other products or services we think may be of interest to you. In the absence of your express prior consent, we will only send you marketing emails to advertise for our own products or services that are similar to those you purchased from us. You can object (opt-out) to the receipt of such marketing emails at any time, without any costs arising (other than transmission costs), by following the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of each marketing email or by contacting us as described in the section entitled, “Contact Us”, below. In addition, if you submit your resume, we will contact you about potential employment opportunities. We may share your personal information with third parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have partnered to offer a particular product or service as described in the section entitled “How we share information with third parties” below. We use technical information which does not identify individual users, to improve user experience and overall quality of our Sites, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. For example, each visitor to the Site is identified by an IP address during their visit and IP addresses are automatically captured by Site management software. Veracode uses this information to help improve the operation of the Site and may at some time use this information to help adjust the content of the Site to the general geographic location of the visitor and for reporting purposes. Because technical information does not personally identify you, we may also use and disclose technical information for any other purpose. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may combine personal information with technical information. If we do so, we will treat all combined information as personal information as long as it is combined. The personal information we collect is deleted once it is no longer used for the purposes stated above and if no statutory retention obligations apply (in which case the data will be deleted after the applicable retention period).

**3\. How we share information with third parties**

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties and we will not provide any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. The personal and technical information you provide to the Site may be shared, to the extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent necessary, with our third party agents and service providers who help Veracode operate the Sites; help Veracode provide the services requested by you; contribute to Veracode’s own sales and marketing efforts; and help Veracode with its recruitment and staffing efforts.

We may also transfer and disclose information, including personal information, to third parties in order to comply with a legal obligation; when the law requires it, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; to investigate fraud; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of users of the Sites or others, in all cases only if and to the extent such transfer and disclose is permitted by applicable law.

In addition, In the event Veracode goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. By providing your personal information, you agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent. You will be notified via email and/or a notice posted on our Sites of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

**4\. Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. Please be assured that we have adequate security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of any personal information we receive from you. 

**5\. Links to other websites**

The Sites may contain links to third party websites such as the websites of Veracode partner companies. Veracode takes no responsibility for the content, operation or privacy practices of such websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites, and you should check the policies of any linked website before offering information to the sponsor of the website. Veracode provides these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link to such websites does not imply endorsement by Veracode of those sites.

**6.** **Veracode Blogs and other Forums**

If you use a blog or similar forum, or other chat or similar tool that we may make available on the Sites, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Veracode is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. You are also responsible for using these forums in a responsible and professional manner consistent with any applicable terms of use or other terms and conditions that may be set forth on the relevant forum site.

**7\. Where we hold data/Safe Harbor Framework**

We operate the Sites from the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By visiting the Sites, or providing us with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen. Veracode complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  Veracode has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Veracode’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

**8\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and change the date at the top of the policy. Therefore, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Site for any updates or changes. We will notify users of any material change to this Privacy Policy when the user next uses services through the Site.
