Some Veracode pages use cookies that permit select third party partners, including Google, to provide you Veracode related content, including Veracode advertisements, on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet. This is based on your prior visits to the Sites.

Additionally, third parties use cookies to allow you to link to social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. As noted below, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can control whether or not these cookies are used, but preventing them may stop us from offering you some services. Alternatively, you may use the third parties' own tools to prevent these cookies.

## Managing Cookie Preferences

Many web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, and only you can manage your browser settings.

In addition to the options provided above, you may refuse or accept cookies from Veracode’s websites at any time by activating settings on your browser. Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen. You may wish to refer to [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917085612/http:/www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html) for information on commonly used browsers. Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of Veracode’s websites may operate as intended.

You can adjust your cookie preferences by adjusting your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether. The Help function within your browser should explain how to do this. Alternatively, you may visit [www.aboutcookies.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917085612/http:/www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917085612/http:/www.allaboutcookies.org/) to obtain detailed information on how to prevent cookies from being set on your particular browser.

Some of our web pages use “Frames” to serve content to/from our business partners while preserving the look and feel of our website. A Frame is a part of a web page or browser window which displays content independent of its container, with the ability to load content independently. Please be aware that you are providing your Personal Information to these Third Parties and not Veracode.

If you want to opt-out of targeted interest-based advertising, please visit Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Consumer Opt-Out website at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>, or if you are located in the European Union/European Economic Area, please visit European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Your Online Choices website at <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

## Do Not Track

Certain browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari offer a “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option that sends a signal to websites visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. Because uniform standards for “Do Not Track” have not been established, Veracode does not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals.

## Web Beacons

Veracode also uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your use of our websites and actions regarding emails from us. A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email message. Web beacons help Veracode measure the effectiveness of our websites and our advertising in various ways. For example, web beacons count the number of individuals who visit a particular web page after viewing an advertisement or identify the number of individuals who opened or acted upon a marketing email message.

Our third-party ad services providers also use aggregated information collected through web beacons and cookies about your visit to Veracode’s website(s) in order to deliver advertising relevant to your interests and to better understand the usage of our websites and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Statement does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third-party cookies, and Veracode encourages you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other tracking technologies.

## Social Media Accounts

Portions of our websites make chat rooms, forums, blogs, message boards, and/or news groups available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas could be made public so exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information. Also, please note that use of these portions of our website may be subject to additional terms. Additional information about community and support sites can be found at our [Terms for Use](https://www.veracode.com/about/terms-of-use) on Veracode.com.

In addition, Veracode’s website(s) may include social media features, including the Facebook “Like” button. These features may collect your IP address and identify the web page you are visiting on Veracode’s website and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by that social media site to post information about your activities on Veracode’s website(s) to your profile page on that social media site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company that is providing them.

## Third-Party Websites

Veracode’s websites may contain links to other third-party websites. This Privacy Statement does not apply to, and Veracode is not responsible for, the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites, including business partner websites, and their use of personal information will be governed by their own privacy policies.

Veracode may modify or update this Privacy Statement at any time without prior notice. If we make any changes to this Privacy Statement, we will change the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of this Privacy Statement. If we make material changes to this Privacy Statement that may impact individual rights, Veracode will make prominent note of such change on its website and within its products, services, programs and applications at least one month prior to the change taking place.

Individuals in the EU/EEA and Switzerland have a number of rights in relation to their Personal Data. Veracode will maintain a program to ensure compliance with this Privacy Statement. All Veracode workforce members whose responsibilities include the Processing of EU/EEA/Swiss Personal Data are required to adhere to this Privacy Statement and any implementing policies. Failure to do so is deemed a serious offence, for which disciplinary action may be taken, potentially resulting in termination of employment. Equally, the misuse of Personal Data by an individual or organization acting as a Sub-contractor, or service provider to Veracode is deemed a serious issue for which action may be taken, potentially resulting in the termination of any agreement. Veracode will assist individuals in the EU/EEA and Switzerland in protecting their privacy and will provide them opportunities to raise concerns about the Processing of their Personal Data.

Individuals in the EU/EEA and Switzerland have the right to make Personal Data access requests. If an individual makes such a request, Veracode will provide the information requested which may contain some or all of the following information, along with other information as required by applicable law:

Disclosures by Veracode will normally be in electronic form if the requester has made a request electronically unless he/she agrees otherwise.

If the requestor wants additional copies, Veracode charges a reasonable fee, which will be based on the administrative cost to Veracode of providing the additional copies **.**

To make a personal data access request, individuals in the EU/EEA or Switzerland should send their request to Veracode’s Privacy Officer by email at [privacy@Veracode.com](mailto:privacy@Veracode.com) with the words “Data Subject Access Request ” in the subject line.

You may also contact Veracode by regular mail to:

Veracode, Inc.

65 Network Drive

Burlington, MA 01803

Attention: Veracode Security Operations

Veracode may need to ask for proof of identification before a request can be processed. Veracode will inform the requestor if it needs to verify his/her identity and the documents it requires

Veracode will normally respond to a request within a period of 30 days from the date a request is received. In some cases, such as where Veracode Processes large amounts of the individual’s data, it may respond within 90 days of the date the request is received. Veracode will write to the requestor within 30 days of receiving the original request to tell him/her if more time is needed to complete the response to their request.

If an EU/EEA or Swiss individual submits a request which is manifestly unfounded or excessive, Veracode is not required to comply with it. Alternatively, Veracode can agree to respond but will charge a fee, which will be based on the administrative cost of responding to the request.

Individuals in the EU/EEA and Switzerland also have a number of other rights in relation to their Personal Data. They can request Veracode to:

  * Correct inaccurate Personal Data to the extent consistent with applicable law and Veracode’s obligations to its customers;
  * Stop Processing or erase Personal Data that is no longer necessary for Veracode’s purposes of Processing to the extent consistent with applicable law and Veracode’s obligations to its customers;
  * Stop Processing or erase Personal Data if the individual's interests override Veracode’s legitimate grounds for processing the Personal Data including to the extent consistent with applicable law and Veracode’s obligations to its customers;
  * Stop processing or erase Personal Data if the processing is unlawful; and/or
  * Stop processing Personal Data for a period if the requestor asserts the Personal Data is inaccurate or if there is a dispute about whether or not the requestor's interests override Veracode's legitimate grounds for processing the Personal Data.



Where Veracode determines that the requestor’s Personal Data is accurate to the extent consistent with applicable law, Veracode will include in Veracode’s Personal Data file the alternative text that the requestor believes to be appropriate alongside Veracode’s original information. If it is determined that the Personal Data needs to be updated or corrected by Veracode, Veracode will use reasonable efforts to inform the relevant Veracode customer and Third Parties which were provided with the information previously.

To ask Veracode to take any of these steps, individuals in the EU/EEA or Switzerland should contact Veracode by email at [privacy@Veracode.com](mailto:privacy@Veracode.com) with the words “DATA SUBJECT REQUEST” in the subject line.

## International Transfers of Personal Information

Veracode’s website is provided from within the United States and is subject to the state and federal laws of the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, your Personal Data is being transferred to, stored, used and shared in the United States. 

If you are located in the European Union, European Economic Area or Switzerland, Veracode transfers your personal information to other Veracode entities located in many different countries around the world if required for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. This may include the transfer of your personal information to countries outside your home country, including outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which may not have the same level of protection as your home country. For example, since Veracode is headquartered in the United States (US), Veracode entities in the EEA may need to send your personal information to our servers located in the US for legitimate business purposes. In order to provide adequate protection for the transfer of your personal information, we rely on various legal mechanisms, including our Privacy Shield certifications, EU Standard Contractual Clauses and/or the need to process your personal information in order to provide the requested products or services.

Personal Data is also transferred by Veracode to countries outside the EU/EEA or Switzerland for Veracode’s legitimate interests in processing Personal Data where necessary to perform its obligations to its customers and to exercise its rights and fulfill its duties under law.

## EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks

Veracode complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries (including Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Veracode has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Statement and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Veracode is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain Veracode’s confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon your request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should direct their query to [Privacy@veracode.com](mailto:Privacy@veracode.com). If requested to remove data, we will respond within a 30 days.

We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to [privacy@veracode.com](mailto:privacy@veracode.com).

Veracode’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Veracode remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Veracode proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Veracode may be required, in certain circumstances, to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Veracode commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Veracode by email at [privacy@Veracode.com](mailto:privacy@Veracode.com) with the words “PRIVACY STATEMENT” in the subject line.

Veracode has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our US-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [ICDR/AAA](http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html) operated by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, the international division of the American Arbitration Association (ICDR/AAA). If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html> for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.

If your complaint involves employment or human resources personal data transferred to the United States from the EU and/or Switzerland in the context of your employment relationship with Veracode, and Veracode does not address it satisfactorily, Veracode commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPA Panel) and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, as applicable and to comply with the advice given by the DPA panel and/or Commissioner, as applicable with regard to such employment or human resources personal data. To pursue an unresolved employment or human resources personal data complaint, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority where you live or work. Complaints related to employment or human resources personal data should **not** be addressed to the [ICDR/AAA](http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html) operated by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution.

If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.
