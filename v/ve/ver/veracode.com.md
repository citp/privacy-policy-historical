# Privacy Policy | Veracode

**Privacy Policy**

**Effective as of September 9, 2016**

Veracode takes privacy issues and your privacy very seriously.  This Privacy Policy describes the personal information Veracode, Inc. and Veracode Limited (“Veracode”, “we”, “us” and “our”) collects about you through [www.veracode.com](https://www.veracode.com/) and its related websites (the “Site(s)”), why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties. By using and visiting our Sites, you agree to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other Veracode product, service or application, or websites that display or link to different privacy policies. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us as described in the section entitled, “Contact Us”, below.

**1\. What information we collect**

We collect certain personal information on our Sites, e.g. information in relation to prospective customers interested in our solutions, information from users of the Sites to help us manage our customer relationships and information from candidates responding to job advertisements. Personal information is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, address, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address. We also collect certain technical information from users of our Sites which may include information about how you use our Sites, the areas of our Sites that you visit, your internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, and your internet service provider (ISP). We will not knowingly collect or use personal identifying information from children younger than 13 without parental consent.

The following is a more detailed explanation of these types of information.

**Personal Information**

We may collect information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, phone and fax numbers and e-mail address, when you submit a form, such as, but not limited to, a form that requests additional information about Veracode solutions. We may collect additional information if you choose to submit it, including, but not limited to: job title, employer, business telephone number, and mailing address. We will only collect and use this information to the extent it is necessary to respond to your inquiry, form/amend or perform a contractual relationship with you, and to send you communications related to our solutions, products, services, promotions, company, and other products or services as further described in the section entitled, “How we use information we collect”, below. 

If you choose to submit your resume to us through our Sites or via a third party website, we will collect the information provided in order to contact you about potential employment opportunities.

**Technical and usage information**

We and our third party service providers may collect technical information from you, including anonymized information about how you use our Sites and the areas of our Sites that you visit. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Sites. You should be aware that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to "invade" your hard drive and collect personal or other information from your computer. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a web site as seamlessly as possible.

Some Veracode pages use cookies that permit select third party partners, including Google, to provide you Veracode related content, including Veracode advertisements, on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet. This is based on your prior visits to the Sites.

Additionally, third parties may use cookies to allow you to link to social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. As noted below, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can control whether or not these cookies are used, but preventing them may stop us from offering you some services. Alternatively you may use the third parties' own tools to prevent these cookies.

**How to Manage Cookies**

In addition to the options provided above, you may refuse or accept cookies from the Sites at any time by activating settings on your browser.  Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen.  You may wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html> for information on commonly used browsers.  Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Sites may operate as intended.

You can adjust your cookie preferences by adjusting your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether.  The Help function within your browser should explain how to do this.  Alternatively, you may visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) to obtain detailed information on how to prevent cookies from being set on your particular browser.

**2\. How we use information we collect**

We collect personal information about you through the Sites to communicate with you, to the extent permitted by applicable law, about our solutions, products, services, promotions, company, and other products or services we think may be of interest to you. In the absence of your express prior consent, we will only send you marketing emails to advertise for our own products or services that are similar to those you purchased from us. You can object (opt-out) to the receipt of such marketing emails at any time, without any costs arising (other than transmission costs), by following the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of each marketing email or by contacting us as described in the section entitled, “Contact Us”, below. In addition, if you submit your resume, we will contact you about potential employment opportunities. We may share your personal information with third parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have partnered to offer a particular product or service as described in the section entitled “How we share information with third parties” below. We use technical information which does not identify individual users, to improve user experience and overall quality of our Sites, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. For example, each visitor to the Site is identified by an IP address during their visit and IP addresses are automatically captured by Site management software. Veracode uses this information to help improve the operation of the Site and may at some time use this information to help adjust the content of the Site to the general geographic location of the visitor and for reporting purposes. Because technical information does not personally identify you, we may also use and disclose technical information for any other purpose. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may combine personal information with technical information. If we do so, we will treat all combined information as personal information as long as it is combined. The personal information we collect is deleted once it is no longer used for the purposes stated above and if no statutory retention obligations apply (in which case the data will be deleted after the applicable retention period expires).

**3\. How we share information with third parties**

We will share your personal information only in the ways and with third parties that are described in this policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties and we will not provide any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. The personal and technical information you provide to the Site may be shared, to the extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent necessary, with our third party agents and service providers who help Veracode operate the Sites; help Veracode provide the services requested by you; contribute to Veracode’s own sales and marketing efforts; and help Veracode with its recruitment and staffing efforts.

We may transfer and disclose information, including personal information, in response to lawful requests by public and governmental authorities and law enforcement agencies, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. In addition, we may disclose personal information to customers, vendors, service providers, public and governmental authorities and law enforcement agencies where required in order to comply with a legal obligation; when the law requires it, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; to investigate fraud; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of users of the Sites or others, in all cases only if and to the extent such transfer and disclosure is permitted by applicable law. 

In addition, in the event Veracode goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. By providing your personal information, you agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent. You will be notified via email and/or a notice posted on our Sites of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

**4\. Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. Please be assured that we have adequate security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of any personal information we receive from you. 

**5\. Links to other websites**

The Sites may contain links to third party websites such as the websites of Veracode partner companies. Veracode takes no responsibility for the content, operation or privacy practices of such websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites, and you should check the policies of any linked website before offering information to the sponsor of the website. Veracode provides these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link to such websites does not imply endorsement by Veracode of those sites.

**6.** **Veracode Blogs and other Forums**

If you use a blog or similar forum, or other chat or similar tool that we may make available on the Sites, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Veracode is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. You are also responsible for using these forums in a responsible and professional manner consistent with any applicable terms of use or other terms and conditions that may be set forth on the relevant forum site.

**7\. Where we hold data**

We operate the Sites from the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By visiting the Sites, or providing us with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen. 

**8\. U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield Framework and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework**

If you are located in the European Union or Switzerland, Veracode complies with and participates in the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data collected via the Sites from European Union member states and Switzerland:

  * Veracode has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. If there is any conflict between the terms of this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). To view Veracode’s current self-certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>. Veracode is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission in respect of Veracode’s self-certification of compliance with the Privacy Shield framework. Veracode may be liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a third party processes personal information in a way inconsistent with those Principles, unless Veracode proves it is not responsible for the event giving rise to damage.
  * Veracode has certified that it adheres to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Veracode’s certification, please visit [https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?loc=swiss&id=33067](https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?loc=swiss&id=33067).



Where a user has a dispute or complaint regarding Veracode’s collection, storage, or use of your personal information, you may make a complaint to Veracode by sending it to the contact email address listed below. We will respond to you within 45 days of receiving your request. Where the dispute or complaint is not satisfactorily resolved or you don’t receive a timely response, you may escalate the matter to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution of the American Arbitration Association (<http://info.adr.org/safeharbor/>) (the “AAA”) free of charge, or contact the AAA for more information. 

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved, you may have the right, under certain limited conditions, to invoke binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission.

**9\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and change the date at the top of the policy. Therefore, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Site for any updates or changes. We will notify users of any material change to this Privacy Policy when the user next uses services through the Site.

**10\. Your Rights**

You have the right to access and/or correct your personal information we hold about you by making an access and/or correction request and sending it to the contact email address listed below. We will respond to you within 40 days of receiving your request. You can make such a request by sending it to the contact email address listed below.

Other than as set out in this policy, we will provide you with notice and give you the right to opt out if your personal information is to be disclosed to a new third party controller or to be used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
