Further, and in order to provide the services and improve Vertical Insider’s websites, we may engage the services of third-party vendors.

Vertical Insider uses third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill Users for transactions, and a credit scoring company to determine business credit scores (when applicable, for extending credit terms to Users upon request). At all times, these parties are required to agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we deploy reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information.
  3.
