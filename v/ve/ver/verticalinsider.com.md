VerticalInsider.com and BookmarkInsider.com are two of the properties within the Vertical Insider LLC network of sites. Each of these sites hosts thousands of white papers as well as white paper Research Libraries on third party sites. Some Third Party Content made available through the Research Library sites is maintained on the website of the Content Provider, and not on the Vertical Insider LLC network of sites. This means that when you click through to that Third Party Content, you will be leaving the Research Library and the Vertical Insider LLC Network. It will be clear to you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page will change, and the URL will no longer refer to a website in Vertical Insider LLC network of sites. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information you choose to disclose to the Content Provider on the Content Provider site.

In addition, the Sites you are viewing may be co-branded, meaning that the Sites are branded with the logos of both Vertical Insider LLC and a third party (“Co-Branded Sites”). If you register or log in on a Co-Branded Site, you are choosing to disclose information to both Vertical Insider LLC and the third party with whose brand the site is co-branded. This Privacy Policy only governs Vertical Insider LLC’s use of your information. The third party’s use of that personal information is governed by the partner’s privacy policy, and not by this Privacy Policy.
