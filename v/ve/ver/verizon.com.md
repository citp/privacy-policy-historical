Verizon collects personal information such as name, address, and e-mail address, when you knowingly provide it to us. Our Web servers automatically collect statistical information about your visit such as pages visited and which browsers are used to visit our site. None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies). We use these statistics to monitor our site's performance and to make it easier for you to use.

What happens when I provide personal information on this Web site?  
When you supply information for a specific purpose, such as online ordering of a Verizon service, we use the information for that purpose.   
When you use our Web site to order services, we may use this individually identifiable information as we would if obtained in a non-electronic manner. Such information may include:

  * Publishing your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published or non-listed number)

What happens when I provide information on registration forms?  
When you choose to register with verizon.com or any other Verizon site, we request accurate contact information and preferences that help us better serve you. You will be able to choose if your contact information is used to send you company and product information, special offers, and in some cases, newsletters. 

If you're a local Verizon phone service customer, you may be given the option to register a profile with us (limited to specific areas). We would then store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase from us in the future. Customers have access to their account information on their monthly bills or by establishing an [account online](undefined). 

Anytime you register with us you may:

  * Opt out. At any time after the initial registration, you can opt out by either going to [Contact Us](undefined) and e-mailing us your request, or in some applications you can cancel/change your profile within the application itself. 
  * Update your contact and personal information anytime by [notifying us](undefined) of changes to this information previously collected from you online. 
  * Notify us if you find an error on your bill. 

In order to improve your experience with us, we may decide to improve our site's ability to obtain information about users. We will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.

Does Verizon sell or give my information to non-Verizon companies?  
No, we do not sell or disclose individually identifiable information obtained online about our visitors to anyone outside of Verizon. The only exceptions to this rule are the following:

  * If you specifically authorize Verizon to share your information with another company 
  * It is required by law 
  * Disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees, or property 

If you provide individually identifiable information at an event Verizon sponsors with another company, or if you register on a co-sponsored Web site, you may be providing the individually identifiable information to the co-sponsor. Review the privacy statement at the event or on the co-branded site to learn how the partner uses this information. Be assured that Verizon uses this information in accordance with this privacy policy. 

On occasion, Verizon shares non-personally identifiable information with non-Verizon companies in order to assess the results of a promotion or event. This information is used in aggregate only, and does not contain any information that would personally identify you.

Does Verizon accommodate links to other sites?  
Yes, our site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites. However, in some instances where a service is provided through a non-Verizon partner or supplier site, such as Online Bill Pay, you can feel confident that your individually identifiable information will be protected. Verizon requires suppliers not to use the information for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected, protecting the privacy of your information.

What does Verizon do with non-personally identifiable information collected automatically?   
Verizon uses cookies to collect this type of information in order to enhance your online experience as follows:

  * Ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live 
  * Manage the number of ads that you see to avoid over-delivery of the same message 
  * Tailor an advertisement to better match your interests and preferences

What does Verizon do with personally identifiable information?  
Personal information you voluntarily supply when obtaining information, purchasing products, or interacting with our advertising on verizon.com **is not shared for use outside Verizon**.

Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, Verizon will contact you via e-mail notifying you of this change and give you the opportunity to choose to opt out of such use.

Does Verizon use the information provided online to profile its customers?   
No, Verizon does not combine offline information about you with the online information that you provide on our Web site. 

We have made it a requirement that you will be clearly notified at the time of online data collection for the purpose of consumer profiling. When your online purchase behavior is intended to be combined with offline information, this intent will be clearly stated. You will then have the ability to choose not to have that information aggregated.

E-mail

  
Does this site send e-mail to site visitors?   
At times, we may utilize e-mail for any of these reasons:

  * To conduct online surveys 
  * To respond to a site visitor's e-mail 
  * To confirm orders placed online 
  * To send information that a visitor has requested 
  * To use opt-in e-mail lists from third parties occasionally to promote our latest specials 

In all of these situations, Verizon will provide you with directions on how to opt out of future e-mails of this nature.

Security Issues

  
How does Verizon protect my personal information?  
We are committed to protecting the information you give us, so we implement the appropriate safeguards to do so. Any information that you give us is protected by a password with a minimum of six characters for added security. Within Verizon, your information is stored in password-protected, limited-access servers. Wherever possible, Verizon servers reside behind a corporate firewall that maintains tight controls on any access to the system from both our internal network and the Internet.

Cookies

  
What are cookies and why does Verizon use them?  
A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your hard drive. It contains your unique user ID for our Web site. We use cookies to deliver Web content specific to your interests, to keep track of your online order, and to control access to our premium content. A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. You may choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique verizon.com user ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on this Web site, such as ordering in our online store.

[Back to Top](undefined)

What information is stored by the site or in cookies?

Online Advertising

  
What is Verizon's position regarding online advertising and third-party ad servers?  
As an online advertiser, Verizon uses information supplied from third-party companies in several ways. **This is aggregated data that does not personally identify any individual online user.** This data is used to:

  * Evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing online media plans 
  * Geographically target advertising 
  * Deliver product and pricing information applicable to the customer's state 
  * Gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising 

Again, personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address is not collected unless you voluntarily supply this data in order to get further information about Verizon products and services. 

In addition, some Verizon Web sites -- for example, [www.superpages.com](undefined) \-- may accept advertisements from third-party advertisers. These advertisers are carefully selected to provide information about products and services that we think may benefit you. Please check the privacy policy of these Web sites concerning what information may be collected by third-party advertisers. 

Third-party advertising companies may also utilize technology in order to measure the effectiveness of ads. Some Verizon Web pages contain clear GIFs (also know as Web beacons), electronic images that allow the third party to collect anonymous information. This anonymous information about your visits to our site is used to provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. No personally identifiable information is collected during this process.
