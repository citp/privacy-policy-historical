<p><a id="InformationWeObtainandHowWeUseIt" name="InformationWeObtainandHowWeUseIt"><strong>Information We Obtain and How We Use It</strong></a></p>
<p>You may choose to provide personal information — including, but not limited
to, your first and last name, physical address, e-mail address, or telephone
number — through the Site. Here are ways
you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. We
also describe how we may use the information you provide to us. </p>
<p><strong><em>Information We Obtain</em></strong></p>
<p>You may contact us by filling in information on forms or by sending an e-mail. Each form varies in the information required and collected. In most cases, an asterisk (*) indicates the required information on a form. You may choose to provide additional information within fields that are not required. You may complete a form or send us an e-mail to purchase a product, register for a conference, submit a request, respond to an e-mail or blog posting,&nbsp;ask a question, apply for a job, or make a comment. We may use the information provided to respond to your inquiry, contact you about your request, ask a question, provide announcements about products and future events, conduct surveys, consider your application for employment, and contact you for other reasons related to offering and improving our services.</p>
<p>We may offer visitors to our Site various features, which we may change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain personal information so we can provide you with those features.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Uses of Information</em></strong></p>
<p>In addition to the uses discussed above, we also may use the personal information you provide on our Site to operate, evaluate, and improve our business. Specific uses include developing new products and services; managing our communications; performing market research; advertising and marketing; analyzing our products, services, and websites; and administering our websites. We also may use the information to protect against and prevent fraud, claims, and other liabilities and to comply with or enforce applicable legal requirements, industry standards, and our policies and terms. In addition, we may use the information we obtain through this Site in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection. </p>
<p><strong><em>Information We Obtain by Automated Means</em></strong></p>
<p>When you visit our Site, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, web server logs, tracking pixels, and web beacons. Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to identify your browser uniquely or to store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell you when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Site and may not be able to purchase products that use a “shopping cart.” You can order any product by telephone by calling Verisk Customer Service at 1-800-888-4476.</p>
<p>Our web servers may log information such as your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. The web server logs also may record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. They may also log information about your interaction with this Site, such as which pages you visit. To control which web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags called “web beacons,” — small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies. We may also collect information from your browser, such as your browsing history, and use it in conjunction with data gathered from forms and e-mails to help us understand and respond to your needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Site uses tracking pixels — transparent graphic images placed on web pages — which, in combination with cookies, collect information regarding your access of and interaction with the web pages that contain the pixels. Verisk may work with third-party marketing agencies for placement of such pixels on our Site and to provide advertisements to you based on your visits to the Site. The pixels and third-party marketing agencies assist us in serving you advertisements based on your perceived interests. The marketing agencies may themselves set and access their own cookies and other technologies on your computer to track certain behavioral information regarding your visits to the Site. Such third-party cookies are set, among other things, (a) to help deliver advertisements to you; (b) to control when and how often advertisements are served to you; and (c) to understand how the advertisements are useful to you. Note that any advertisements served by third parties in association with third-party cookies and other technologies may serve as web beacons, enabling third parties to carry out the previously identified activities. Third-party cookies, web beacons, and other third-party technologies are governed by each third party’s privacy notice. We may use a variety of companies to serve content and/or advertisements. For example, the companies may include members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). For more information, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>, which provides information regarding the practices of NAI members, your choices regarding having your information used by those companies, and the “opt-out” procedures for NAI members. </p>
<p>We also use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as those of Eloqua and Google Analytics. The service providers that administer those services may use cookies and web beacons to help us analyze how users use the Site. The information collected by the cookies and web beacons (including your IP address) is available to the service providers, which use the information to evaluate your use of the Site. </p>
<p>To learn how to opt out of Google Analytics, visit: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</a> <br>
To learn how to opt out of Eloqua web analytics, visit: <a href="http://www.eloqua.com/about/privacy/opt_status/">http://www.eloqua.com/about/privacy/opt_status/</a>.</p>
<p>We use information collected online through cookies, web beacons, and other automated means<strong> </strong>for purposes such as<strong> </strong>customizing and enhancing our visitors’ visits to the Site, facilitating use of the Site, collecting statistics about your visit to the Site, and understanding the manner in which our visitors browse the Site. We also use the information to help diagnose technical and service problems, administer the Site, and identify visitors to the Site. We use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on web pages of the Site, how visitors navigate through the Site, and how we may tailor the Site to&nbsp;meet the needs of our visitors. </p>
<p><strong><a id="DoNotTrackSignals" name="DoNotTrackSignals">“Do Not Track” Signals</a></strong></p>
<p>Your browser settings may allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. Like many other websites and
online services, we do not currently process or respond to “Do Not Track”
signals from your browser or to other mechanisms that enable choice. Please
note that, while we do not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals, we do
not permit third parties to collect your personally identifiable information
(PII) and track your activity over
time and across third-party websites or online services.</p>
<p><strong><a id="InformationWeShare" name="InformationWeShare">Information We Share</a></strong></p>
<p>We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect on our Site, except as described here. We may share personal information we collect on this Site with affiliates and service providers that perform services on our behalf. We do not authorize those service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share personal information we collect on this Site with our affiliates and with other reputable companies, which may use the information for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, we may disclose personal information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as court order or subpoena), (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or (iv) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution, or liquidation). Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner consistent with our Online Privacy Notice. </p><strong><a id="YourRightsandChoices" name="YourRightsandChoices">
<p><strong>Your Rights and Choices</strong><strong></strong></p></a></strong>
<p>We offer you certain choices about how we communicate with you and what information we obtain from you. As required by applicable law, you may withdraw consent you previously provided to us. We will apply your preferences going forward. You may exercise these choices by
