# verabradley.com - Vera Bradley - Privacy Policy

Welcome to Vera Bradley's website! We are proud to have this opportunity to tell you a little about our company, our products and our history. Before you begin exploring, we'd like to review the steps we have taken to ensure that our visitors have a safe, enjoyable experience. 

**Our Commitment To Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. Vera Bradley values our consumers' privacy and has made it our policy to provide online content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. Furthermore, to better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personal information may be requested. Vera Bradley reserves the right to change, modify, add to or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. 

Below are some of the ways in which a visitor may provide information to us online and how we may use that information. 

**Information Actively Provided by Our Visitors**  
Vera Bradley only collects personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. Personal information may include name, address, email address, phone number, birth date, and occupation. Unless specifically stated, we do not require this information to obtain access to our site. The personal information we collect is used by Vera Bradley only for the specific purpose for which it is submitted, as indicated below and on our website. For example: 

**Customer Service**  
On some pages our visitors can submit comments or ask questions. We also collect personal information when you send us emails containing questions or requests. We do not save any personal information associated with comments. We only save personal information associated with questions and requests in our customer service database (data which does not expire and is retained) in order to respond to those questions and requests, and to better serve you when responding to any questions or requests you may have in the future. 

**Catalog Requests**  
The names and mailing addresses submitted by visitors who request a printed catalog are used only to mail the catalog and are not shared, unless you have given us permission to do so, for example, by checking the box allowing us to share your information with your favorite store, or by checking the box allowing us to share your information with our marketing partners. If you would like to remove your name and address from our catalog mailing list, please send an email to [customercare@verabradley.com](mailto:customercare@verabradley.com).
