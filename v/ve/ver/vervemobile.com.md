# Privacy Policy | Verve

**ADVERTISING AND DATA SERVICES PRIVACY POLICY**

Verve Wireless, Inc. (“Verve”) is committed to protecting consumer privacy and to clearly informing users about the collection and use of information.

This policy covers information that is collected and used by Verve’s advertising and data services (“Services”). For information collected at the Verve corporate web site, please refer to the Verve Web Site Privacy Policy below. When we use the phrase “Personal Information” we mean contact information (e.g., name, address, email, or telephone number) and any other information that is used to personally identify an individual.

When we use the phrase “Non-Personal Information” we mean information that is not used to personally identify an individual or data that can be linked to an individual device but where technical, contractual, and legal measures are in place to prevent the identification of an individual.

By visiting or using our Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from any child under 13 years of age. If we are informed or become aware that our Services are being used on a site or app directed at children, we will restrict the use of ad serving information to uses permitted under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

**Personal Information**  
We collect Personal Information when you knowingly and voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you provide us feedback or request information from us. You do not have to provide Personal Information to use our Services and we do not collect Personal Information through our Services except as described in this Privacy Policy. Verve may identify your device using an operating system supplied ID such as Apple’s Advertising Identifier, Google’s Advertising Identifier, or a randomly assigned unique identifier. The advertisements delivered by Verve may include forms or other prompts that allow users to opt-in to share data. However, it is your choice whether or not to provide that data.

**Location Data**  
In order to make advertising messages as relevant as possible, precise location data may be used for targeting ads and as input into location targeting segments based on the characteristics of locations. Location data is also used to count impressions, clicks, and other metrics to model household locations for the purposes of demonstrating marketing impact of advertiser campaigns. Location data that you provide to an app or web site may be provided to Verve for ad serving or reporting purposes. In addition, supplemental information may also be used such as a device’s speed of movement and positioning, proximity of nearby devices, or similar information available from an operating system. You can opt-out of the use of precise data for location-based tracking by using the settings available on your mobile device. Ads will continue to be selected for you based on more general information, such as location that can be inferred from Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other data.

**Non-Personal Information**  
From Services that utilize mobile websites or HTML: we collect information automatically when you use our Services through the use of log files and alpha-numeric identifiers known as “cookies” that are usually stored with the device’s web browser. This Non-Personal Information we collect via Services includes your IP address, browser type, browser language, device type and version, the date and time of your request, amount of data transferred, the source of your request (page referrer), and the nature of the content delivered to you. We generally use cookies to help with customer tracking. Our cookies do not contain Personal Information. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and/or persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. Persistent cookies can be removed or blocked by following the directions in your Internet browser. We also use log files and cookies to improve the quality of Services and pages you have visited. Third parties, such as analytics vendors, may provide services to us or to Publishers and advertisers and they will also collect Non-Personal Information from your device. From Services that utilize mobile applications: in addition to the advertising identifiers described above, Verve will collect information about the type of app you are using and details such as IP address, device type, carrier, and operating system. Verve utilizes this information to uniquely identify mobile devices to deliver targeted marketing messages to consumers. We believe that the presentation of relevant marketing messages assists in providing a more meaningful mobile web experience. For example, this technology enables Verve to limit the number of times a specific message is presented to a consumer (frequency capping), to support product category preferential marketing and to deliver advertising based on your location.

**Web Beacons**  
We may permit Publishers and advertisers to use a software technology called pixels (a.k.a., web beacons), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, used to report non-personal individual or aggregate information and help us better manage content on our Services. In addition, we may use pixels in our advertisements to let us know which ads have been viewed or to help tailor advertising.

**Information from Third Parties**  
We may also get information about your devices from other sources. We may add this to information we obtain from your use of Services.

**Advertising and Data Services — Your Choices**  
Verve uses Non-Personal Information as described above to help tailor which ads are displayed to you as you visit web sites or apps using our Services. Information that Verve collects as you visit a web site or app will be used to create an ad serving profile used to determine the ads displayed and to report about the effectiveness of that advertising. Personal Information you provide may be converted into Non-Personal Information by Verve and by our partners in order to link other available data about you, including linking the various devices you may use. To opt-out of the use of this information to tailor the ads you are shown, you can use the “Limit Ad Tracking” settings on your mobile device. You will continue to see ads, but they will not be selected based on your activity across unrelated web sites or apps. Please see <http://www.allaboutdnt.org/> for a further description of your options.

**Sensitive Information**  
When we create profiles to serve ads based on your activity across different web sites or apps, we restrict the use of advertising categories that we deem sensitive based on local law, applicable industry codes, and our own internal standards.

**Retention**  
We retain ad serving data that is linked to an individual user for as long as needed to support our business needs for ad-delivery, reporting and auditing, but for no longer than two years, after which such data is deleted or minimized by having unique user level identifiers removed.

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. BY USING THE SERVICES AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.

**Third Parties**  
Verve may disclose certain Personal Information:

  * To third-party contractors who help us provide the Services, in which case we will take reasonable steps to ensure that these parties comply with confidentiality obligations and contractually require these parties only use the information as needed to provide services to us;

  * Verve may disclose Non-Personal Information to vendors, such as analytics companies and to advertisers, ad networks, other partners, and third parties. To opt-out of sharing by Verve of individual level information with additional parties, you can use the “Limit Ad Tracking” settings on your mobile device.

**VERVE EU-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD POLICY**

When we transfer personal information from the European Union to the United States, we and our subsidiary (Verve Wireless, Inc. and Verve Wireless, Ltd., respectively) comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States, respectively. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

Verve has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit: <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

For any questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, please contact us at:  If Verve does not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to the [DMA](https://thedma.org/resources/consumer-resources/privacyshield-consumers/), Verve’s designated independent dispute resolution provider.

**Under certain conditions specified by the principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint**. Verve is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC. If Verve shares EU Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on Verve’s behalf, then Verve will be liable for that third party’s processing of EU Data in violation of the Principles, unless Verve can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) have the right to access the personal information that Verve maintains, and in some cases, may have the right to correct or amend information that is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
