  * It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms, or as otherwise required by law.
  

  * We transfer information about you if ZURB or Verify is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, ZURB will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
