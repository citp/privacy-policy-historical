Our purpose in collecting information from you is to help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about special offers and promotions. We will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy statement.</p>
<p><strong>Key Definitions</strong></p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, we use the following key definitions. Other terms are defined in the body of the policy.<br>
“Click stream Data” means the information that Vertical Insider LLC collects through cookies, log files, beacons and clear GIFs, as described in Section 4 below.<br>
“Content Provider” means a third party that owns a white paper, analyst report or other document and allows Vertical Insider LLC to link to or display that document on the Sites.<br>
“User” or “you” means any person viewing any page of the Sites.<br>
“Third Party Content” means the white papers, analyst reports and other documents available through the Sites and owned by Content Providers.</p>
<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>Profile Information: Our primary goal in collecting profile information (which may include your name and the following business – and not home or personal – information: title, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address) is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services, and to offer you opportunities to obtain other products and services from us and our partners. Because we derive revenue mainly from advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users.</p>
<p>We collect profile information when you provide it to us through the following: when you register on one of our sites, or an e-mail newsletter, register for one of our events or register to use certain services (like webcasts and white papers). Several of the services that we offer on our sites may require registration as a condition of use. Once you register with one of the Vertical Insider LLC network of sites, including VerticalInsider.com, BookmarkInsider.com, you are no longer anonymous to us. We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as Dunn and Bradstreet, and add it to the information you provided to us.</p>
<p>Cookies: Like most sites, for account management purposes, Vertical Insider LLC uses cookies. Cookies are data files stored on your computer that identify you as a unique user. Cookies enable us to track user trends, preferences and patterns to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers permit users to refuse cookies or to be notified before a cookie is accepted. You can visit our site without using cookies.</p>
<p>Subscriber Information: If you subscribe to an email newsletter and become a “Subscriber”, Vertical Insider LLC collects your email address, password and areas of interest. Member Information: If you register as a Member (such as by registering on a content directory, subscribing to a newsletter, registering on VerticalInsider.com, BookmarkInsider.com and/or our other aforementioned web properties, Vertical Insider LLC collects additional information, including your name and corporate title, the name of your company and the department in which you work, your industry group, country, zip code and telephone number (“Member Details”). At the time you register to become a Member, or later when you access a particular page or document, Vertical Insider LLC may collect additional information, including but not limited to: information about software or hardware your company is using, plans your company may have to purchase additional products/services, etc.. All of this information together is included in the definition of “Member Details”.</p>

<p>Cookies: Vertical Insider LLC uses persistent cookies to link Members to their registration information, which allows our system to confirm a user’s identity and access level on the Sites.

<p>Disclosure of Personal Information<br>
Philosophy: The Content Providers make the Third Party Content available through Vertical Insider LLC in return for receiving the contact information of Users who view their Third Party Content. Accordingly, if you view Third Party Content, Vertical Insider LLC may disclose your Member Details, Click stream Data and Supplementary Information to the Content Provider, as set forth in more detail below. If you do not want this information disclosed to a Content Provider, do not view the Third Party Content. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Vertical Insider LLC will not disclose personal information to any third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vertical Insider LLC may at any time disclose profile information to third parties if we are required to do so by law, regulation or court order.</p>
<p>Member Information: When you view Third Party Content, Vertical Insider LLC may disclose your Member Details and Click stream Data, together with Supplementary Information, to the Content Provider. Vertical Insider LLC’s customer agreement with the Content Provider: (a) provides that the Content Provider may use this information only to send you product information, to contact you via common methods of communication to assess your interest in its products and services, and to assess your interest in the Content Provider’s products and services; and (b) prohibits disclosure of this information to any third party other than agents of the Content Provider for the permitted marketing purposes set forth above.

<p><strong>Updating Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>You may update or correct information you previously provided to Vertical Insider LLC by accessing your user profile on our various directory web sites.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites </strong></p>
<p>VerticalInsider.com and BookmarkInsider.com are two of the properties within the Vertical Insider LLC network of sites. Each of these sites hosts thousands of white papers as well as white paper Research Libraries on third party sites. Some Third Party Content made available through the Research Library sites is maintained on the website of the Content Provider, and not on the Vertical Insider LLC network of sites. This means that when you click through to that Third Party Content, you will be leaving the Research Library and the Vertical Insider LLC Network. It will be clear to you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page will change, and the URL will no longer refer to a website in Vertical Insider LLC network of sites. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information you choose to disclose to the Content Provider on the Content Provider site.</p>
<p>In addition, the Sites you are viewing may be co-branded, meaning that the Sites are branded with the logos of both Vertical Insider LLC and a third party (“Co-Branded Sites”). If you register or log in on a Co-Branded Site, you are choosing to disclose information to both Vertical Insider LLC and the third party with whose brand the site is co-branded. This Privacy Policy only governs Vertical Insider LLC’s use of your information. The third party’s use of that personal information is governed by the partner’s privacy policy, and not by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The Vertical Insider LLC Web Site also contains links to other Web Sites. Please be aware that Vertical Insider LLC is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every Web Site that you visit from our Web Site or through the interactive sessions.</p>
