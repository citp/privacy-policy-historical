The type of personal information collected and how it is used varies across our website(s). This Privacy Policy explains what type of information is collected and tracked through the veritas.com web site ("Site"), how the information is used, with whom the information is shared, and your options regarding the collection and use of such information.

Why VERITAS Software Collects Personal Information Top  
VERITAS Software may request your personal information to enhance your use of the Site, to identify, advise you of and provide access to products and services that may interest you, and to respond to requests for technical or customer support or other inquiries. Other than such requests, users can generally visit the Site without identifying themselves or revealing any personal information. To help us better understand our users, we may also use tracking mechanisms (such as cookies or embedded URLs) to track visits -- collecting information such as IP address, browser type and operating system – but these mechanisms do not independently collect your personal information.

Tracking (Cookies And Embedded URLs) Top  
In order to create and deliver more useful content to improve the quality and user experience of the Site, we use tracking information (collected through cookies or embedded URLs) to identify the areas of our Site most visited by our customers. 

**Cookies:**   
A "cookie" is a very small text file placed on your hard drive that uniquely identifies the user by collecting the following information: a unique identifier, user preferences and profile (to personalize the content that is shown), and any previously provided membership or personal information. Although cookies may contain personal information about site use if the user has previously registered with the Site, cookies do not, in and of themselves, collect personally identifying information. When you return to the Site, "cookies" simply help us to retrieve any personal information or preferences you provided to allow a more streamlined login process and efficient use of the site. Most browsers are initially set to accept "cookies," but you can set your browser to alert you every time a "cookie" is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it. For more information on "cookies," visit [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). Some cookies used by VERITAS Software may remain on the user’s computer after they leave the Site. 

**Embedded URLs:**   
In an effort to enhance your experience and the utility of our Site, we may use a tracking tool utilizing embedded URLs (to allow use of the Site without cookies). Embedded URLs are exhibited as plain text or encoded extensions to the URL that appear in the browser address or location toolbar. They allow limited information to follow the user as it navigates the Site but do not identify or collect personal information and are limited to the current session.

Collection And Use Of Personal Information Top  
VERITAS Software may ask you to provide certain personal information about yourself such as name, address, e-mail address, phone number, purchase details, credit card/payment information, and other personally identifying information. This information may be requested to: enable you to make purchases; download a demo, white paper, e-book or other product; sign up for a seminar; register a product; request support; ask VERITAS Software to contact you; participate in VERITAS Software’s on-line programs, communities or promotions; or to allow VERITAS Software to provide updates and information and/or support regarding its products and services, send electronic newsletters, respond to user inquiries and requests for information, provide information on educational events, enable joint sales or product promotions (with VERITAS Software partners), enable your participation in interactive discussions and public forums, or as a result of legal requirements. 

Participation is completely optional. Continued use of some of the features on our Site, however, may be conditioned upon providing such personal information. If you elect to give us your personal information over the Internet, VERITAS Software will take reasonable precautions to ensure the security of your information including using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window. 

VERITAS Software is a global company and our main datacenters are in the USA. You consent to the collection by, or transfer of, your data to the USA and/or to VERITAS affiliates and partners as specified herein.

With Whom VERITAS Software Shares The Personal Information It Collects Top  
VERITAS Software is a global company and some of the personal information collected may be shared with its internal business units and affiliated companies, resellers and distributors around the world, and/or fulfilment partners or vendors. The information may be shared to provide the service or information requested, such as to complete a transaction or to enable VERITAS Software to better create and deliver products and services to you. 

VERITAS Software may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) conform to the law including complying with any legal process served on VERITAS Software; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of VERITAS Software and our websites; or (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of VERITAS Software employees or agents, users of VERITAS Software products or services, or members of the public. 

VERITAS Software also may make certain personal information (excluding credit card information) available to our business partners for the purpose of providing information regarding VERITAS Software's products or services we think may interest you in accordance with the VERITAS Software Option Policy below. 

The VERITAS Software Option Policy Top  
The information you provide may be used by VERITAS Software or selected third parties for marketing and communication purposes. If you do not have an existing relationship with VERITAS, we will offer you the opportunity to elect to (i) receive such communications from VERITAS Software or (ii) allow VERITAS Software to share your information with selected third parties ("Options"). You may set or change your Options during the registration process, from links in marketing mailings, or by sending an "unsubscribe" e-mail to our webmaster ([webmaster.veritas@symantec.com](mailto:webmaster.veritas@symantec.com)) with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject of the message and your exact name, address, e-mail address, and phone number in the body of the message. Additionally, you may return to the registration profile to change your Options. 

The choice to provide personal information is voluntary; however, VERITAS may not provide certain services or benefits to you unless VERITAS has received such personal information (such as purchases and evaluation or other downloads). Similarly, providing certain products or services (such as product, evaluation or trail downloads or access to white papers or e-books) may require or be conditioned upon our and our business partners' ability to send you future communications. Such communications may include patch and product security updates and related communications, communications related to product download or products or services that may interest you, communications specific to a trading or user community (such as price / product information to partners), communications regarding conference registrations, or other communications that are associated with a specific transaction. 

VERITAS Software will record your Options in our database(s). VERITAS Software will also make this information available to business groups within our company worldwide. Please note, however, that due to the distributed nature of our business and systems, we cannot guarantee that your Options will be honored immediately by all of VERITAS Software's communications programs. 

Please contact us at [webmaster.veritas@symantec.com](mailto:webmaster.veritas@symantec.com) if you believe you have mistakenly received information after electing not to receive such information or have any trouble using the mechanisms provided on any VERITAS Software website or via an e-mail link.

How To Correct Or Update Your Personal Information Top  
If you need to correct or update your personal information registered with VERITAS Software, you may either return to your registration profile or contact the webmaster ([webmaster.veritas@symantec.com](mailto:webmaster.veritas@symantec.com)) and use "personal profile update" as the subject of the message. Please make sure to include your previously registered name, address, e-mail address and phone number along with any new personal information in the body of the message. VERITAS Software will record the change(s) in our database and make this change available to business groups throughout our company worldwide. Due to the distributed nature of our business and systems, we cannot guarantee that your web-based change request will update your information immediately in all VERITAS Software systems. 

Link To Other Sites Top  
Please note that while our Site provides links to other websites that may be of interest to you, these links are provided as a convenience to you. VERITAS Software does not control, and shall not be responsible for the content or privacy practices of such third party websites.

Advertising  Top  
VERITAS Software permits a limited amount of advertising and sponsorships on its Site. No personally identifiable information is passed back to the advertisers as part of this process, but aggregate profile information, such as user community, may be used in the selection of advertising to make sure that it has relevance to the user. Some advertisements may use embedded pixels, which, although not collecting personal information, may return session connection information to advertisers to better determine how many individuals clicked on their advertisement banner. Like other external links, the privacy policies of advertisers are beyond the control of VERITAS Software and users should review such third party privacy policies prior to providing information.

Note About Children Top  
Minors are not eligible to use our websites, and we ask that they do not submit any personal information to us.

Changes To This Privacy Policy Top  
VERITAS Software may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and encourages you to review it regularly. Updates or changes may include descriptions of how new site features affect use of your information or notification of new control and preference features. If VERITAS Software implements any changes that may result in use of your personal information in a manner that is materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will post a prominent notice on our Site or if required by law use reasonable efforts to notify you (i.e. via e-mail). Users will have the opportunity to opt out of any materially new or different uses, as described above.
