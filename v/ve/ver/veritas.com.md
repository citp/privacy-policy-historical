**Interest-Based Ads**

We may provide information about your interests in our products to third parties for the purposes of serving you more relevant ads. Where we provide you with interest-based ads on a site other than our own, we do not track your other activities on that site. If you click on our ads, we will know only the domain you came from.

**Information from third parties**

Third parties may provide us with information about you from online and offline sources. We may combine such information with the information we already have about you in order to provide you with a better experience, determine your interest in our products or improve the quality of our offerings.

**Veritas website forums or networking sites**

We operate forums, websites and related information services, to better assist you in using our products and services, discussing technical issues and sharing your experiences. You should be aware that any information you provide in these public forums will not be kept confidential, as it may be read, collected and used by others who access them. To request removal of your information from any forum, contact us _here_. In certain circumstances, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know why. Your use of these other services may be subject to additional terms and conditions.

## How we protect your information

#### Safeguards

We have taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your information from misuse, unauthorized or unlawful access or disclosure, loss, alteration, damage or destruction. These measures include:

**Physical safeguards** , with locked doors and file cabinets, controlled access to our facilities and secure destruction of media containing your information.

**Technology safeguards** , like the use of anti-virus and endpoint protection software, encryption, and monitoring of our systems and data centers to ensure that they comply with our security policies. For example, credit card information is transmitted using secure socket layer (“SSL”) encryption.

**Organizational safeguards** , like training and awareness programs on security and privacy, to make sure employees understand the importance and means by which they must protect Your Information. Our organization privacy policies and standards also guide our handling of your information.  


**Storage of your information**

The information we collect from you may be stored on servers in the United States and anywhere Veritas or our vendors operate.

**Links to other websites**

Our websites may contain links to other websites, which are owned or operated by other companies. If you choose to visit any linked websites, we encourage you to review their privacy statements carefully, as they may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of websites that are owned by companies that are not within the Veritas group of companies.

Our websites may also link to co-branded websites that are maintained by Veritas and one or more of our business partners, who are collecting your information pursuant to their own privacy practices. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on any co-branded site to which you link for information on the privacy practices of that site.

**Children’s privacy**

Our site is not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 13.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently.

We may use cookies, Web beacons, pixel tags or other similar technologies on our websites or emails to, among other things:

  * Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;
  * Collect statistics regarding your website usage;
  * Provide us with business and marketing information; and
  * In some cases, to enable a third party to deliver future advertising for our products and services to you when you visit certain websites owned by third parties.



We use different kinds of cookies:

  * **Essential cookies** are necessary to provide you with services and features available through our websites. Without these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.
  * **Analytics or customization cookies** collect information that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the website for you.
  * **Advertising cookies and tracking scripts** are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly delivered and, in some cases, featuring ads based on your interests.



If your website includes a cookie management tool, you will find a hover button at the bottom of your screen.

If you do not wish to receive cookies you may be able to refuse them by adjusting your browser settings to reject cookies. If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services or support. If you have previously visited our websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.

**Do-Not-Track**

There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal.

Please note that our websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from Web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals.

For more detailed information about cookies, Do-Not-Track and other tracking technologies, please visit [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

**Third Party Data Collection**

This may also include cookies placed by third parties, to deliver tailored information and content which may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third party websites after you have left our websites. We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you (such as email address) on our site, nor do we share with them any personal information about you. ****

**Social Media Features and Widgets**

Our websites include social media features, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, and widgets, such as the “Share This” button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features are usually recognizable by their third party brand or logo and may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
