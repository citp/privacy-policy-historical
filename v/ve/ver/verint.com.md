# Verint's Privacy Policy

**LAST UPDATED:** MARCH 2014

 **Verint Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries** (“Verint”) are concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through the website owned and controlled by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “ **Site** ”) as well as certain information we collect from offline sources, as explained in more detail below. By providing Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

If you apply for a job through the Site, our use of the Personal Information you provide through our Career Center is governed by a separate privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy. Please click [here](https://web.archive.org/about/careers/index.html "Careers")[](http://verint.com/corporate/careers_list.cfm) to review our privacy policy for job seekers who apply for jobs through the Site.

Verint complies with the U.S. – E.U. and US- Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union and Switzerland. Information regarding the E.U. and Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks can be found at: <http://export.gov/safeharbor>. A copy of Verint’s Safe Harbor policy can be found at <http://verint.com/About/legal/verints-safe-harbor-policy/index>.

### Personal Information

 **Personal Information We Collect**

“ **Personal Information** ” is information that identifies you as an individual, such as:

>   * Name
>   * Postal address (including billing and shipping addresses)
>   * Telephone number
>   * Email address
>   * Organization and job title or function
>   * Login ID, PIN or other Password for access to certain content on the Site

We may merge Personal Information collected through the Site with Personal Information that we collect about you offline, such as business contact information that we receive in connection with sales presentations, your e-mails to us or your purchases from us, information gathered when you attend a trade show, seminar or other business event, or information provided by your employer if your company enrolls you in a training event. All such merged Personal Information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We use third-party payment services (" **Payment Service** ") to collect payments for purchases made through the Site. If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service providers) and not by Verint. Any Personal Information that you provide through the Payment Service’s webpage will be collected by Payment Service and not by us, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BY SUCH PAYMENT SERVICES.

### How We Use and Disclose Other Information

Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then, in addition to the uses listed in the “How We Collect Other Information” section above, we may use and disclose Other Information for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.

 **Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting** Our goal at Verint is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. We use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.

Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across Verint’s websites.

For example, if you often visit content on the Verint network about Enterprise Workforce Optimization, we or our service providers may use “web beacons” to infer your possible interest in WFO and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest when you are on the Site or on a third-party site. It's important to understand that these technologies use anonymous identifiers within the “cookies” stored in your browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our AdChoices page [hyperlink].
