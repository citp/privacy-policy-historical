            <p>The personal information that Users provide will only be used in connection with the Services offered by Vend, to communicate with Users in relation to the Services or to co-operate with any government, industry or regulatory authorities.

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>Vend uses cookies on its website. Cookies are small text files that are placed on the browsers of visitors to our website for record-keeping purposes and so that (for example) your preferences can be recognised when you come back to our site. Those cookies include both temporary or session cookies that are deleted when you close your browser, and permanent cookies which remain on your device.</p>
            <p>Vend participates in advertising programmes operated by third parties, for which advertising and retargeting cookies are used. Advertising cookies allow us to make advertising more relevant for visitors to our site, by showing adverts that users might be interested in seeing (based on other sites they have visited and previous browsing history) and avoiding showing adverts that they have already seen.</p>
            <p>Retargeting cookies allow Vend to advertise to visitors to our website via third party websites. Those third party websites show their visitors advertisements for Vend's services based on cookies which tell the third party website that the visitor has previously visited Vend's website.</p>
            <p>The cookies we use also mean that data relating to traffic on our website and about the types of third party websites that visitors to our website also visit are aggregated and shared with other participants in the third party advertising programme. The data that is shared does not contain any personal information and cannot be used to identify any individual visitor.</p>
            <p>You can opt out of receiving cookies by adjusting the settings in your web browser.
