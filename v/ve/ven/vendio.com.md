We may also transmit your credit card to partners, such as universal registration partners, whom you specifically select to receive this information. 

**3.3. Information We Track.** As you use our services, our servers or third party servers will automatically track certain information about you in log files. This information includes your IP address, the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, which browser you are using, which operating system you are using, your device screen resolution, mouse events, keypresses, geographic location (country only), preferred language, date and time when pages were accessed. This is not unique to our websites as many existing sites automatically collect this information. These log files are not linked to your personal information. Vendio also records participation in our online communities, including messages submitted, contributions through wikis or buying guides, and reviews/ratings. 

**3.4. Merchants.** Vendio hosts stores on vendio.com and powers stores hosted on other domains. These merchants use Vendio's technology and infrastructure to power the presentation and transaction processing of their stores.

**4.2. Referrals.** Users who refer other users under our referral program may view usage data in the aggregate for their referrals.

**4.3. Demographic Information.** We aggregate broad demographic and usage information on our user base, which we disclose to our current and prospective advertisers.

We use the information about the interests our users to increase the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional efforts and to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to create a personalized product that better satisfies our users' needs. We may also use information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners. 

**4.4. Personally Identifiable Information.** We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise share any personally identifiable information about our users to any third party, except with your consent or for the specific purposes described in this statement.

This includes, but is not limited to the names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of our users. You should refer to the privacy policy of the co-branded site to review their data collection and handling policies. In addition, except as we describe here we will not disclose any personally identifiable financial or security related personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers and or passwords.

For example, we may be forced to disclose information to government and/or law enforcement agencies or third parties under certain circumstances. Vendio cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries and reserves the right to reveal your identity (or whatever information we know about you) in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from your use of the services or features on the Vendio website. In addition, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we make it a practice not to disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party, we do not promise that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private.

**5.5. Third Parties.** We will disclose your information to third parties or suppliers as necessary to complete your transactions.

We will notify you should such an event occur in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 11 and will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy with respect to your information. 

**5.6. Service Providers.** We use service providers to help us perform some of the services on our site.

**5.7. Contests.** We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information such as their email address, full name, and street address. We use contact data from our contests to contact our winners and to send users information about our company.

**5.8. External Service Providers.** This site contains links to many other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Since Vendio does not control the privacy policies of third parties, such as but not limited to other online auction sites, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions and review their stated privacy policies before you disclose your personal information to others. 

**5.9. Advertisements.** We use outside advertising companies to display ads on our site. These advertisements may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads may be collected by the outside advertising companies, and we do not have access to this information.

If you participate in the online communities provided by Vendio (for example, our message boards, wikis, product buying guides, reviews/ratings, etc.), your username will be posted along with your contributions. Users are also given the opportunity to create a profile that may be viewed by other users. Users are given the option when entering this information to make it viewable by other users or request that it remain private. If the user chooses to opt-in to this option of disclosing their information to third parties or other users, then the user may receive promotional items. You may later elect to opt-out in accordance with the "Opting-Out" section.

**7.2. Other Users Information.** In the course of using the services at Vendio you may be exposed to personally identifiable information of other users. Under no circumstances may you disclose personally identifiable information about another user to any third party without the consent of Vendio and the consent of such other user. Vendio does not tolerate spam, and we reserve the right to suspend the registration of any user who sends unsolicited email to our other users. 

**7.3. Spam.** If you choose to opt-in to allowing other users to view your email address when registering, you should use discretion.

If you believe that you have received unsolicited email from an Vendio user, please notify us [using this form](http://www.vendio.com/ecommerce/contact). 

**8\. Security**  
Vendio uses industry standard efforts such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, even the most robust security systems are not foolproof and users should consider this when revealing any personally identifiable information to any party over any form of media.  **9\. Opting Out**  
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. However, if a user decides at any time not to receive future communications, the user may remove their information from our database by sending an email [using this form](http://www.vendio.com/ecommerce/contact). **10\.

For this section, we use the terms "Personal Data" and "processing" as they are defined in the GDPR, but "Personal Data" generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and "processing" generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.
