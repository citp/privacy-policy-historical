# Venue.com: Privacy Policy

**Our Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies only to personal information collected via this Web site, and not to any other activities of Venue or its affiliates or companies whose products and services we sell. Personal information means information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, or credit card information, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Venue does not own or control, or to people that Venue does not employ or manage. 

**Information Collection and Use**

**Information**

When visiting any Web site, your browser sends information to the site's hosting server identifying the browser you are using, your Internet Service Provider, the page you last visited, and the page you are currently visiting. We log this information and we may also track and catalog the search terms that you enter in our search forms. When you purchase a product at Venue.com, we may collect certain information about your purchase and offer of credit (such as name, address, phone number, social security number, e-mail address and credit card and expiration date). We use this information to administer and improve Venue.com, to process and follow up on your order, and to contact you. 

**Cookies**

We make use of a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" to help us recognize you when you pay a repeat visit to Venue.com. Cookies let us personalize your shopping experience based on your preferences and help Venue.com to work better to serve you.   
Most browsers accept cookies. However, if you wish, you can usually set your browser to refuse cookies. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to submit an order online. Venue does not use cookies to gather any personal information. 

**About Children**

For their protection, we prohibit anyone under age 18 from submitting any information without the consent of a parent or guardian. Venue never intentionally contacts anyone under age 18 about special offers or for marketing purposes. We refuse to sell or ship any items directly to anyone whom we know to be under the age of 18. 

**Security**

We use industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology, a secure server, and other physical and procedural safeguards to protect the security of your personal information. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
