This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information submitted by Users on the vendhq.com website (the " **Website** ") or emailed to Vend, and any information that may be automatically retrieved through the services that Vend offers on the Website (" **Services** ").

* ## Consent

By accessing the Website and/or using the Services, all Users consent to the collection, use, disclosure, storage and processing of their information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Vend may amend or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, with or without notice to Users. All Users agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy that is in effect at the time they access the Website and/or use the Services.

* ## Personal information

In order to use the Services, all Users will need to submit certain personal information such as their email address, name, address, telephone number, gender and date of birth. Users may be asked to submit further information from time to time.

* ## Use of information and data

The personal information that Users provide will only be used in connection with the Services offered by Vend, to communicate with Users in relation to the Services or to co-operate with any government, industry or regulatory authorities. Vend reserves the right to use data (on an anonymous basis) in relation to Users' use of the Services for marketing purposes.

* ## Disclosure of information

Unless expressly authorised to do so by the relevant User, Vend will not disclose any User's personal information to any third party except where the disclosure relates to the purposes for which the information was collected (as stated in paragraph 6 above).

* ## Storage of information

Vend will securely store Users' personal information in New Zealand or in any other country which Vend may from time to time offer its Services. Users' personal information may therefore be transferred outside of New Zealand.

Vend may hold Users' personal information both before and after the cancellation of each User's account, but only for as long as Vend is lawfully entitled to do so.

* ## Cookies

Vend uses cookies on its website. Cookies are small text files that are placed on the browsers of visitors to our website for record-keeping purposes and so that (for example) your preferences can be recognised when you come back to our site. Those cookies include both temporary or session cookies that are deleted when you close your browser, and permanent cookies which remain on your device.

Vend participates in advertising programmes operated by third parties, for which advertising and retargeting cookies are used. Advertising cookies allow us to make advertising more relevant for visitors to our site, by showing adverts that users might be interested in seeing (based on other sites they have visited and previous browsing history) and avoiding showing adverts that they have already seen.

Retargeting cookies allow Vend to advertise to visitors to our website via third party websites. Those third party websites show their visitors advertisements for Vend's services based on cookies which tell the third party website that the visitor has previously visited Vend's website.

The cookies we use also mean that data relating to traffic on our website and about the types of third party websites that visitors to our website also visit are aggregated and shared with other participants in the third party advertising programme. The data that is shared does not contain any personal information and cannot be used to identify any individual visitor.

You can opt out of receiving cookies by adjusting the settings in your web browser. To find out how to do that, and to learn more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
