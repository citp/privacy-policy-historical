<h1><strong>Ventra Privacy Policy</strong></h1><p>
  <strong>Overview</strong></p><p>
  The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)  and the Ventra Participating Transit Agencies (collectively, the “Ventra  Agencies”) are committed to ensuring Ventra customer privacy and security.  Specifically: (1) the Ventra Agencies will not provide personal  identifying information (“PII”) from Ventra Accounts to any third party without  express customer consent, except as described in this Privacy Policy; (2) PII  from Ventra Accounts will not be provided to advertisers for their use; and (3)  the Ventra Agencies will maintain a secure environment for customer PII.</p><p>
  This Privacy Policy is intended to  provide an understanding of how the Ventra Agencies handle PII collected by  Ventra. Among other things, this policy explains the types of information  collected from Ventra customers and specifies the third parties with whom the  Ventra Agencies and Cubic Transportation Systems (the “Ventra Contractor”) may  share this information.</p><p>
  The Ventra Contractor operates the  Ventra Customer Service Center and the Ventra Call Center. The Ventra User  Agreement provides that by enrolling in Ventra and using the transit systems, a  customer allows the Ventra Agencies, the Ventra Contractor, and other third  parties referenced herein to process PII according to the provisions set forth  in the <a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/terms/">Ventra User Agreement </a>and  this Ventra Privacy Policy.</p><p>
  <strong>Definitions</strong></p><p>
  The following definitions apply:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Personal Identifying Information (PII):  </strong>PII identifies 
 or describes a person or can be directly linked to a specific individual. 
 &nbsp;Examples of PII include, but are not limited to, a person’s name, mailing 
 address, billing address, business name, alternate contact information (if 
 given), telephone number, email address, fax number, Ventra Card serial 
 number, credit or debit card number, security code and expiration date, and 
 information related to a customer’s mobile device and location if a customer 
 uses the Ventra Mobile Application.<br>&nbsp;</li>
 <li><strong>Aggregate Data or Aggregate Information:  </strong>Aggregate Data or Aggregate Information is statistical information  that is derived from collective data that relates to a group or category of  persons from which PII has been obtained or collected. Aggregate Data  reflects the characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. The  Ventra Agencies may use Aggregate Data and provide Aggregate Data to others to  generate statistical reports for the purpose of managing the Ventra Card and the  Ventra Agencies’ Ventra program operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Collection of Personal Identifying  Information (PII)</strong></p><p>
  A Ventra Account may either be <a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/terms/">registered  or unregistered</a>. If a customer registers a  Ventra Account, the Ventra Agencies collect personal identifying information  from applications and other forms submitted by Ventra customers to the Ventra  Customer Service Center by telephone, mail, facsimile transmission, in person,  or by electronic submission through the Ventra website or via the Ventra Mobile  Application. The Ventra Agencies also consider data developed as a  byproduct of a customer’s use of the Ventra system (e.g., a registered user’s  travel routes and times traveled) to be PII if a Ventra Account is registered.</p><p>
  Additionally, the Ventra Mobile  Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not  limited to, the type of mobile device being used, a mobile device’s unique  device ID, the IP address of a mobile device, the type of mobile operating  system, the type of mobile Internet browsers used on the mobile device, and  information about the way a customer uses the Ventra Mobile Application.  When a customer uses the Ventra Mobile  Application, the Ventra Agencies may use GPS or other similar technology to  determine a customer’s location in order to provide certain services available  via the Ventra Mobile Application.  If  you do not want your location being used for such purposes, you should turn off  the location services for your mobile device in your account settings.</p><p>
  <strong>How the Ventra Agencies Use Personal  Identifying Information</strong></p><p>
  The Ventra Agencies use PII provided by customers in order to provide services  through the Ventra website and Ventra Mobile Application, to effectively and  efficiently process enrollments, manage accounts, respond to questions, send  customer emails about Ventra program updates, and otherwise communicate with  Ventra customers.</p><p>
  PII is only utilized as described in  this Privacy Policy.</p><p>
  <strong>Third Parties with Whom the Ventra  Agencies May Share Personal Identifying Information</strong></p><p>
  The Ventra Agencies may share PII with any current or future Ventra Agencies for  the purpose of operating and managing the Ventra program. The Ventra  Agencies may also disclose PII to the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) and  the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). If another transit agency or  party is added to the Ventra program, the Ventra Agencies will notify their  customers via amendment to this Privacy Policy and on the Ventra website.  In addition, the Ventra Agencies may disclose PII to third party service  providers for the purpose of operating and maintaining the Ventra system, such  as managing customer accounts and collecting revenue. Any such  contractors are provided only with the PII they need to deliver the service  being provided. The Ventra Agencies require service providers to maintain  the confidentiality of the information and to use it only as necessary to carry  out their duties under the Ventra program.</p><p>
  The  Ventra Agencies require outside law enforcement and regulatory agencies to  obtain a subpoena for Ventra records containing PII, including location data,  unless otherwise required by law, or the law enforcement or regulatory agency  articulates the existence of a bona fide emergency requiring immediate access  to specific records.  Additionally, the  Ventra Agencies may disclose PII without request to appropriate law enforcement  agencies where necessary to protect their or their customers’ rights, property  or safety.  </p><p>
  The Ventra Agencies may provide a  Ventra customer’s PII to a third party as necessary to process any retail  transaction using a Ventra Card that a customer may conduct with retail  merchants other than any of the Ventra Agencies. As with any credit or  debit card payment, if a Ventra customer conducts a transaction with a retail  merchant using a Ventra pre-paid debit card<a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/privacy-policy/#_ftn1" title="">* </a> , the Ventra Mobile Application, or any  other Ventra program media, the Ventra Agencies need to share some information  (for example, the customer’s name and credit or debit card number) with the  banks and other entities in the financial system that process credit or debit  card transactions. The Ventra Agencies are not responsible for third  party use of PII provided to retail merchants at which customers use their  Ventra pre-paid card, the Ventra Mobile Application, or any other Ventra  program media to conduct transactions, regardless of whether the transaction  was conducted in person or online by the Ventra customer. </p><p>
  Besides these entities, PII will not  be disclosed to any other third party without express customer consent, except  as required to investigate and respond to consumer complaints and to comply  with laws or legal process served on any current or future Ventra Agencies or  the Ventra Contractor.</p><p>
  <strong>Retention of Personal Identifying  Information</strong></p><p>
  The Ventra Agencies, through the Ventra Contractor, will only store the PII of  a Ventra customer that is necessary to perform account functions such as  billing, account settlement, or enforcement activities. All PII will be  discarded no later than four years after a Ventra Account is closed or  terminated.</p><p>
  <strong>Security of Ventra Personal  Identifying Information</strong></p><p>
  The Ventra Agencies are committed to the security of customer PII. The Ventra  Agencies, together with the Ventra Contractor, store the PII provided by Ventra  customers on computer servers that are located in secure, controlled  facilities. Servers are designed with software, hardware and physical  security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access.</p><p>
  Access to PII is controlled through  administrative, technical, and physical security measures. By contract,  third parties with whom the Ventra Agencies share PII are also required to  implement adequate security measures to maintain the confidentiality of such  information.</p><p>
  <strong>Ventra Customer Obligations and  Legal Disclaimer</strong> </p><p>
  Ventra customers are responsible for  safeguarding personal mobile devices, usernames, passwords, personal  identification numbers (PINs), and other authentication information that may be  used to access a Ventra account. Ventra customers should not disclose  authentication information to any third party and should notify the Ventra  Agencies of any unauthorized use of their usernames, passwords or accounts.  The Ventra Agencies cannot secure PII that is released by Ventra  customers to others or PII that customers request the Ventra Agencies release  to others.  In addition, there is a risk  that unauthorized third parties may engage in illegal activity, such as hacking  into the Ventra Agencies’ security systems or the Ventra Contractor’s security  system, or by intercepting transmissions of personal information over the  Internet. The Ventra Agencies are not responsible for any data obtained  in an unauthorized manner, and the Ventra Agencies are the only entities that  may authorize obtaining data from the Ventra program by a third party.&nbsp; The  Ventra Agencies are not responsible for any data or PII obtained by a third  party as a result of a Ventra cardholder’s negligence or misuse of Ventra fare  media, products, or equipment.&nbsp; If a Ventra cardholder’s fare media is  lost, stolen, or damaged, the Ventra Agencies are not responsible for any data  or PII that is obtained by a third party until the problem is reported to the Ventra  Agencies as defined in the <a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/terms/">Ventra User Agreement</a>.</p><p>
  <strong>Account Access and Controls</strong></p><p>
  Registering a Ventra Account is in the customer’s discretion. Please see  the <a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/terms/">Ventra User Agreement </a>for  information concerning the various benefits, protections, and potential fees  associated with registering your Ventra Account.&nbsp; The information required  to register an account or to obtain other convenience benefits provided by  Ventra includes PII such as name, mailing address(es), billing address, email  address, telephone number, and, for certain convenience benefits, credit or  debit card number, expiration date and Ventra account security code. The Ventra  Participating Transit Agencies may request other information as required by  law.&nbsp; The Ventra Participating Transit Agencies may request other optional  information, such as alternate contact information, but in such instances the Ventra  Participating Transit Agencies will clearly indicate that providing such  information is optional.</p><p>
  Customers who have registered their  Ventra Accounts can review and update personal information at any time, and are  also able to modify, add, or delete any optional account information. PII  and optional account information can be reviewed and edited as discussed below  under “Updating Personal Identifying Information.” Ventra customers can  close their account at any time by contacting Ventra Customer Service at (877)  NOW-VENTRA. All account information will be deleted no later than 4 years  after an account is closed, terminated, or left inactive by the customer.&nbsp;  See the <a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/terms/">Ventra User Agreement </a>for  more information on the requirements of customer account maintenance.</p><p>
  <strong>Aggregate Data </strong> </p><p>
  The Ventra Agencies may also combine  the PII provided by Ventra customers in a non-identifiable format with other  information to create Aggregate Data that may be disclosed to third parties.  Aggregate Data is used by the Ventra Agencies to improve the Ventra  program and for the marketing of Ventra. Aggregate Data does not contain  any information that could be used to contact or identify individual Ventra  customers or their accounts. For example, the Ventra Agencies may inform  third parties regarding the number of Ventra accounts within a particular zip  code. The Ventra Agencies prohibit third parties with whom Aggregated  Data is shared from attempting to make the information personally identifiable.</p><p>
  <strong>Cookies</strong></p><p>
  The Ventra website, www.ventrachicago.com, stores “cookies” on the computer  systems of users of the website. Cookies are small data elements that a  website can store on a user’s system.</p><p>
  The cookies used by the Ventra web  site facilitate customers’ use of the website (e.g., by remembering login names  and passwords until the session has ended). The Ventra website does not  require that users of the website accept these cookies. Additionally, the  Ventra website does not store third party cookies on the computer systems of  users of the website.</p><p>
  If a user visits a third party  website via a link provided on the Ventra website, the privacy policies of those  other websites will apply and should be reviewed to understand how these  external sites utilize cookies and how the information that is collected  through the use of cookies on those websites is utilized.</p><p>
  The Ventra Agencies do not knowingly  engage in business with any company or vendor that uses Spyware or Malware.  The Ventra Agencies do not market detailed information collected from web  sessions that can be directly tied to personal information.  The Ventra  Agencies do not provide Ventra customers with downloadable software that  collects or utilizes any PII.</p><p>
  <strong>Third Party Websites and  Applications</strong></p><p>
  The Ventra website contains links to third party websites. These web  links may be referenced within content, or placed beside the names or logos of  the other entities. The Ventra Agencies do not disclose PII to these  third party websites except as described in the Ventra Privacy Policy.</p><p>
  <strong>WARNING: The Ventra Agencies are not  responsible for the privacy practices of external websites or applications,  regardless of whether they are accessed through a service or content link.</strong> Please review the privacy policies of external  websites or applications before providing any information to  them.</p><p>
  <strong>Personal Information of Children  Under the Age of 13</strong></p><p>
  The Ventra  Agencies comply with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Act  (COPPA) and the FTC’s Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512).  The Ventra website and the Ventra Mobile  Application are not directed to children, and the Ventra Agencies do not  knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under  the age of 13.  <strong></strong></p><p>
  <strong>Updating Personal Identifying  Information</strong></p><p>
  Customers can review and edit their PII online at <a href="http://www.ventrachicago.com">www.ventrachicago.com</a>, via the Ventra Mobile Application, or by calling Ventra  Customer Service at (877) NOW-VENTRA.</p><p>
  Complaints or problems regarding  updating personal information should be submitted via the <a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/contact-customer-service/">Ventra website</a><u> or </u>by contacting Ventra Customer  Service at (877) NOW-VENTRA.
