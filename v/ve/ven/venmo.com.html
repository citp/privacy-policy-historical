        <p>APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY POLICY</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>This privacy policy applies to all information we collect through our web and mobile applications from Venmo users, including you. This policy only applies to the Venmo Service and does not apply to the practices of any other PayPal service.</p>
        <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>

        <p>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>When you visit the website or use one of our mobile applications, we collect your IP address, and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We also may collect certain geo-location information. If you do not agree to our collection of this information, you may not be able to use our Service.<br>If you open an account, we collect the following information from you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="legal">Account Information - text-enabled cellular/wireless telephone number, machine or mobile device ID and other similar information.</li>
          <li class="legal">Identification Information - your name, street address, email address, date of birth, and SSN (or other governmental issued verification numbers).</li>
          <li class="legal">Device Information -</li>
          <li class="legal">We also may obtain information about you: (a) from your mobile device such as your device type, machine or mobile device identification number, geo-location, time zone, language setting, browser type, and IP address, and (b) from third parties for purposes of transaction processing, identity verification, fraud detection or prevention and other similar purposes. For fraud prevention purposes, we also may link your machine ID with the machines of others who use your same payment cards. </li>
          <li class="legal">
            Social Web Information - including but not limited to your Facebook connect credentials (and information that you authorize Facebook share with us though permissions like this http://developers.facebook.com/images/devsite/auth-dialog-example.png ) and email account information. If you authorize Facebook Connect, the plug in allows us access to your friends' contact information. We also allow you to import data from other social web services, including but not limited to Twitter, FourSquare, and email service providers. Social and e-mail contact information helps you connect to friends and contacts for invitation and payment transmission purposes (as well as helping us improve our services and fight fraud).
            Additionally, another Venmo user may mention you in a transaction in which you are not a party to by “tagging” your username in a transaction note. When you are mentioned in a transaction, a link to your Venmo profile will appear in the transaction note and you will receive a notification about the mentions. You may manage certain contact preferences and notifications in your account settings.
          </li>
          <li class="legal">Financial Information - bank account and routing numbers and credit cards linked to your Venmo account. Venmo does not share financial information with third party social networking services such as those listed in the prior bullet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are committed to providing a safe, secure and all around great service. Therefore, before permitting you to use our Service, we may require additional information from you we can use to verify your identity, address or other information or to manage risk and compliance throughout our relationship. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification, fraud prevention and similar services.</p>
        <p>When you are using the Venmo Service, we collect information about your account transactions and trust relationships and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention and other similar purposes.</p>
