        <p>APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY POLICY</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>This privacy policy applies to all information we collect though our web and mobile applications from Venmo users, including you. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Venmo does not own or control, or to individuals that Venmo does not employ or manage.</p>
        <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>

We also may collect certain geo-location information. If you do not agree to our collection of this information, you may not be able to use our Service.<br>If you open an account, we collect the following information from you:</p>
