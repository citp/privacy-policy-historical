            medium (in particular an email) of the Vente-privee.com Group as a Member. At the end of this period, your Member

        <span>Your Personal Data in relation with an Order on the Site (surname, first name, product or service, delivery/billing
            address, etc.) is kept for a period of three (3) years following an Order. It remains accessible by you and by
            us, in particular from your Member account, to allow you and us to have a complete history of your Orders. We
            can delete it at any time on request from you.</span>

            ten-year retention obligation for invoices set out in Article L.123-22 of the Commercial Code) and/or at least
            during the applicable limitation period (such as the limitation period under common law of five (5) years enshrined
            in Article 2224 of the Civil Code), but also to prevent any possible illegal behaviour after the deletion of
            your Member account (reuse of your old account by a third party, for example) or to respond to your requests

            information transmitted to it during these transactions. This verification involves a processing of Personal

        <span>Security of online payments</span>
    </h2>

    

    <p>
        <span>The Site uses one of the most effective security systems at the present time. Vente-privee.com has not only adopted
            the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption process but has also strengthened all scrambling and encryption processes
            for the best possible protection of all so-called "sensitive" Data related to means of payment.</span>
    </p>

    

    <p>
        <span>For the security of transactions, Vente-privee.com uses the Sogenactif system, developed by Société Générale (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/charte-donnee-groupe-societe-generale.pdf),
            the Mercanet system developed by BNP-Paribas (https&nbsp;://mabanque.bnpparibas/rsc/contrib/pdf/Charte-donnees-personnelles.pdf),
            and the be2bill system developed by Dalenys (https://www.dalenys.com/mentions-legales/).</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>
            <br>
        </span>
        <span>When paying on the Site, your bank details are encrypted on your Terminal, then transmitted in unintelligible form
            to servers which are solely capable of decrypting them. The authorisations and data are then checked with your
            bank to prevent abuse and fraud.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>
            <br>
        </span>
        <span>This process is based on the HTTPS protocol (implementation of SSLv3 or TLSv1 on HTTP), currently one of the most
            robust. </span>
    </p>

    

    <p>
        <span>During transfers via the Internet, it is therefore impossible to read them: no unencrypted information passes through
            the Internet or mobile telecommunication networks.
        </span>

    <p>
        <span>

        <span>When paying, you have the possibility of saving the details of your credit card to facilitate your future purchases

            CNIL.</span>

        <h4>(g) Private browsing</h4>
        <p>The "Private Browsing" mode, now proposed by all browsers, mainly allows browsing without keeping a history of the pages visited or downloads. Regarding Cookies, all those that have been saved during your browsing will be deleted when you close your browser. It therefore is not a solution that allows you to refuse Cookies; however, their lifespan remains limited to the duration of your navigation.</p>
        <h4>(h) Disabling Third-party Cookies</h4>
        <p>The disabling of third-party Cookies allows you to accept only Cookies deposited by the Website, which you also have the option to disable, delete or limit (see Articles (b) to (g) above).  </p>
