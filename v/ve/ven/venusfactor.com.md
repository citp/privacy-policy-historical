The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Venus Factor This policy applies to Venus Factor's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Venus Factor on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Venus Factor's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Venus Factor is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.

## 1\. Collection of Information.

### 1.1 Survey Information.

Venus Factor collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Venus Factor survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Venus Factor or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Venus Factor , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Venus Factor may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Venus Factor or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Venus Factor or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Venus Factor.

### 1.2 Other Information.

Other occasions when Venus Factor obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Venus Factor or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Venus Factor's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Venus Factor service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

### 1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.

Venus Factor currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Venus Factor may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

### (a) Cookies.

A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Venus Factor to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Venus Factor's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.

### (b) Web Beacons.

A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Venus Factor to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Venus Factor might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in Venus Factor's database, visits the fishing website, Venus Factor receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and Venus Factor would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. Venus Factor may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Venus Factor also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Venus Factor's database.

### (c) New Technology.

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Venus Factor's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Venus Factor strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

### 1.4 Outside Information.

Venus Factor may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of Venus Factor including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").

### 1.5 Individual Information.

As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Venus Factor gathers or receives about individuals.

Venus Factor will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Venus Factor obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Venus Factor has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Venus Factor has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

### 1.7 Credit Card Information.

Venus Factor may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Venus Factor. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Venus Factor, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
