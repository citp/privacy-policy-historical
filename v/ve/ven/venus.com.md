To verify the security of our site, look at our URL in your browser window. The letter "s" added to the "http" indicates that SSL is in effect. If you are using Netscape Navigator 3.0 or earlier, the broken key symbol in the lower-left corner of the browser window becomes solid when you are in secure mode. In Netscape Communicator 4.0 and 4.5, the open padlock symbol in the corner changes to closed in secure mode. In Internet Explorer 4.0, a closed padlock appears in the corner when you are in secure mode. Also, in many cases, your browser will warn you if you are about to send information via a site that is not secure.
