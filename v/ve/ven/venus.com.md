Cookies and other web site technologies

Some information is collected automatically every time you visit Venus. Venus and our third party marketing partner collect information about your computer and assign you "cookies" (small, unique identifier text files) when you visit Venus. You do not provide this information—it is collected automatically as a means of supporting your visit to our site. Cookies do not contain any personal information. This anonymous information may be used by our marketing partner to deliver advertisements for products and services tailored to your interests on this site or other sites that you visit. 

Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies but provide features that enable you to be notified when a cookie is to be placed on your browser, decline the cookie, or delete cookies that have been placed on your browser. Most mobile operating systems also provide you an option in the device settings to limit ad tracking associated with your device id. You may also check your web browser’s instructions, help files or privacy documentation for further information. You should be aware, however, that some functions of our website or application may not work or may work slowly if a cookie is refused. This Venus cookie may be used to provide enhanced online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt out of this advertising provided directly by Venus, [click here](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/). When you access the My Account area of the Venus web site, Venus requires you to sign in using your e-mail address and password. Once you sign in we record the e-mail address in the cookie file on your computer. We may also record your password in this cookie file. Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you manually delete the file. 

Use of Technology

These technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Services. Cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address). We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services on this and other online services and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes. 

Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology:  
We evaluate and select third-party partners to help us provide certain features on our Service and analyze our visitors' preferences. These partners may use some or all the technologies described above. 

How is technology used to serve our advertisements on other online services and what choices do you have?  
We also contract with third-party advertising companies, which may collect information about your online activities on the Services, over time and across third-party websites and online services, for use in delivering tailored online display and banner advertising to you on other websites and online services. To serve this advertising, these third-party companies place, use, or rely on the technologies described above, including cookies, clear gifs, device identifiers and similar technologies to obtain information about customer interactions with us through our Services and interactions with other online services. These companies use the information they collect to serve you ads that are targeted to your interests. 

For information about opt out programs that these third party advertising companies participate in, and to opt out of the use of website browsing data for interest-based advertising by companies that participate in these programs, click the following: [NAI Opt Out](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) or, [DAA Opt Out](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/). To opt out of the use of data collected from the mobile applications on your device to serve ads that are targeted to your interests, consult the settings on your device. You can also click the preference icon that may appear on some of our advertising served through use of these technologies. 

How do our Services interact with third-party services and content?  
We may link to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content through our Services. We do this for your convenience. We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their practices. It is possible that the third party providing content through our Services may collect or observe information through its use of technology. Whether the third-party content appears within our Services (like a map frame), or you leave our Services to view it, those service provider's terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless we post a statement that indicates otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices. 

Here's a partial list of the third-party content and services available through or via our Services:  
1\. Inline Framing  
We may embed content on our Services from other online services, such as live or recorded video.  
2\. Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites  
We may rely on the expertise of third-party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Navigation to these sites may be seamless so that it appears you're still using our Services. In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.  
3\. Social Networking and other Third-Party Sites and Services  
We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites and online services, like social networks and other services that host user-generated content. This may include easy click-through access, the ability for you to share content on third-party services, or even "single sign-on" to these services. The third-party's privacy policy applies to any information or content you provide through these services.” 

How Venus Uses Online Remarketing Campaigns

Venus uses remarketing programs allowing us to reach people who previously visited the venus.com website, and match those people with the appropriate message. If you want to opt out of the display of our online advertising, which appears on other Web sites, and which is based on online interactions with venus.com, then please click the preference icon that may appear on such advertising. 

For more information about your options regarding the use of data by Google Analytics, please go to: <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en> .

We await the result of work by the policy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. We do allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for online interest based advertising purposes by going to <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/> or <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> or [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) .
