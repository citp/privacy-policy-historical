				2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy Statement.&nbsp; Visual Engineering, Inc.&nbsp;

				("VE"), operates this web site.&nbsp; All references to "we", "us", "this

				web site" or "this site" shall be construed to mean VE.&nbsp;&nbsp; VE understands

				that visitors to this web site are concerned about the privacy of information.

				The following describes our privacy policy, including our policy regarding

				personally identifiable information that we collect through this web site

				about individuals who use or visit this website.&nbsp; It also identifies

				the categories of third party persons or entities with which we share the

				collected personally identifiable information. <br>

				<br>

				3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection of Personally Identifiable Information ("PII").&nbsp;

				When an individual visits this web site and registers to receive certain

				benefits,&nbsp; we may collect certain categories of personally identifiable

				information.&nbsp; The information we collect may vary depending on the benefits

				selected by the registrant and the information provided by the registrant.&nbsp;

				For example, we may collect the following categories of personally identifiable

				information: name, physical address, an email address, phone number, occupation,

				and account information.<br>

				<br>

				4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing of PII: General Policy.&nbsp; We do not rent,

				sell or share PII with you or nonaffiliated companies, except with your consent

				or as described below.<br>

				<br>

				5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing of PII: Affiliates.&nbsp; Unless prohibited

				by law, we may use and share PII within any companies that may legally affiliated

				with us (such as, for example, any parent, subsidiary, or brother or sister

				entity) for purposes of providing service and account maintenance, to help

				us design and improve products and services, and to offer products and services

				that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

				<br>

				6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing of PII: Third-Party Service Providers.&nbsp;

				When you submit your PII on this site, we reserve the right to share it with

				a reputable third party that provides outsourced services for us ("Third

				Party Service Providers").&nbsp; These Third Party Service Providers may

				include, for example, companies that (i) host, manage, and service our web

				servers, software and systems, (ii) provide business, data processing, or

				marketing services, and (iii) provide payment processing, fulfillment, and/or

				shipping services.&nbsp; Further, all such Third Party Processors are contractually

				bound by us to keep the information confidential, and all information provided

				to or accessible by Third Party Service Providers is required to be used

				by them only for purposes of the service they are providing for this site.

				<br>

				<br>

				7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing of PII: Purchase or Sale of Businesses.&nbsp;

				We continually looks for ways to improve our business.&nbsp; One such way

				of improving our business might be to buy or sell a company.&nbsp; If we

				buy or sell a business, databases containing PII will likely be transferred

				as part of the sale.&nbsp; If we buy a business, we will honor the requests

				of that business' former customers regarding their personally identifiable

				information.&nbsp; If in connection with a sale there will be material changes

				to the way personally identifiable information is being used, affected consumers

				will be notified via e-mail and will be given the opportunity to opt-out.

				<br>

				<br>

				8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing of PII: Legal Process.&nbsp; We reserve the

				right to share PII with third parties in response to a subpoena, to prevent

				fraud, to comply with an inquiry by a government agency or other regulator,

				or as necessary for other legal purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
