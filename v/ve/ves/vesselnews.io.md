I. What Information Is Collected?

A. PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION  
To take advantage of certain optional features or functions of the Illuminare News Corp., we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifying information. Personally identifying information is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your full name, address, or email address), and which we may refer to here as “PII”. For example, you may be asked to supply your name and email address if you complete the optional registration process for the Illuminare News Corp., if you participate in a sweepstakes or contest on the Illuminare News Corp., or if you purchase a classified ad using our online ad placement service. You can choose not to provide such information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some features of the Illuminare News Corp. We do not automatically collect any PII from visitors to the Illuminare News Corp. After creating a profile on Illuminarenews.com, if you wish to change any of your profile information, you may do so by clicking the “My Profile” link when you are logged in and then edit your contact information.

Children Under the Age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit PII from or about children under the age of 13. By submitting any PII, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age. If we discover that we have received any information from or about a child under 13 in violation of this statement, we will delete that information. If you believe that we have collected PII from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at the address provided in the “QUESTIONS” section below.

B. NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION  
Cookies. Like many website operators, we sometimes make use of browser “cookies.” A “cookie” is a small piece of information that we use to assign each visitor’s computer a unique, random numerical identification code that resides in a designated file on your computer. Our cookies do not automatically collect PII. We may use information collected from cookies to recognize your browser when you visit the Illuminarenews.com, to facilitate easy login, to attempt to personalize the Illuminarenews.com for each user, to ensure that your browser does or does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads and offers in a series and to track page usage and paths, to help serve advertisements, or to facilitate your ability to navigate the Illuminare News website. We may link the cookie to PII you submit or other information we collect.

You can configure your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set by choosing this option in the preferences or menu options in your browser. However, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain optional features or functions of Illuminarenews.com.

Log Files. Like most websites, we use tracking programs that collect information about log files, including browser types, Internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps, number of clicks, and Internet protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, which web servers use to identify where to send the information your computer requests. We may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners, or to audit the use of the Illuminarenews.com. We may disclose such non-personally identifying information, such as aggregated statistics, to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing our services, marketing, and improving the experiences of visitors to Illuminarenews.com. The information that we collect regarding log files is not linked to PII.

Web Beacons/Web Bugs (Clear GIFs/ Single-Pixel GIFs). A web beacon allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain limited information about the movements of online web users. No PII is collected through web beacons or web bugs. Advertisers on Illuminarenews.com may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads on the Illuminarenews.com, and they may use such web beacons to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement, in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Advertisers may also place a web beacon to allow them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. We do not control web beacons used by such third parties.

II. How is the Information Collected Used, and How Can I Opt Out?

A. PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.  
Authorized Purposes and Special Offers. PII that you voluntarily submit may be used for the purposes authorized when it was submitted.
