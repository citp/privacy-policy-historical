		<p>We may automatically collect certain aggregated data regarding your use of Veoh, like the number of users and frequency and manner of usage of Veoh. We may also collect aggregated information regarding the use of our subscription-based services, such as the extent to which certain features are used. Aggregated information is anonymous, statistical information that reflects the scope of our user base, sales, customer patterns and related site information. In addition, certain non-personally identifiable information is collected by Veoh and our third-party advertising providers (such as, for example, DoubleClick and other providers ) during your use of Veoh and in serving advertisements to our website, including, for example, the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other personal information).</p>

      <p class="corpSubHeader">Disclosure of Information      </p>
			<p>We may share aggregated statistical information and profile information about users of Veoh with third-parties, including our distributors, vendors, advertisers actual and potential customers, business partners and third-parties that offer products or services for use with Veoh.

These situations include: in response to legal process such as a court order or subpoena; to prevent or combat fraud; as required by federal or state law; enforcement of our Terms of Use; and protection of the rights, property or safety of Veoh, our users or others. </li>
			<li>We may disclose your information in connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of our company and to parents, subsidiaries or affiliates of Veoh. 
			If you access any third-party applications, follow links from the Veoh website to another website, or view Veoh from another website, the information you disclose may no longer be covered by this Privacy Policy.  You are encouraged to check whether other privacy policies will govern before you release any personal information.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes. As such, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your personal information from the threats of tomorrow, or that our security measures are failsafe and not subject to circumvention or unauthorized intrusion. You should also be aware that, despite our best efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data. </p>
