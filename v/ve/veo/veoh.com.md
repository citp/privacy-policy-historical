This information may be used to fulfill your requests for services, to communicate with you about your account, to support your online activities, to respond to your questions, to customize your experience, and to customize the content or features of the Veoh Service. We may use your personally identifiable information to notify you of changes in our website, Terms of Use, or Privacy Policy.

Disclosure of Information

If you obtain the Veoh software bundled with product(s) from a third-party company, we may share some of your personally identifiable information (but not your credit card information) with that company. If we share your personally identifiable information with such a company, that company’s privacy policy will govern its use of your information. 
  3. We may be obliged or deem it necessary or appropriate to disclose your information in certain special situations. These situations include: in response to legal process such as a court order or subpoena; to prevent or combat fraud; enforcement of our Terms of Use or Acceptable Use Policy; or protection of the rights, property or safety of Veoh, our users, or others.

Security 

> Veoh is committed to taking appropriate measures to protect your privacy against unauthorized disclosures. Veoh uses a variety of secure techniques designed to protect your information. 
> 
> While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes. As such, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your personal information from the threats of tomorrow, or that our security measures are failsafe and not subject to circumvention or unauthorized intrusion. You should also be aware that, despite our best efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data.

Third-Party Links 

> Our website may contain links to other sites that you may access. These other sites have their own privacy policies and you should review those policies before following those links. We cannot control the information disclosed at these third-party sites or how that information is used.

Young Children 

> In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under the age of 13. To best protect your child’s privacy, we suggest that you carefully supervise your child’s access to the Internet and our website. For more information on how to protect your child’s privacy, you can visit the Federal Trade Commission’s Kidzprivacy page, accessible via [www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/).

Opt-Out 

> Our website and the Veoh network service provide users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain communications from us regarding products and services in which you may be interested. You will be given this opportunity at the time we request information about you. If you do not opt-out at the time you provide information, but choose to opt-opt later, click [here](mailto:optout@veoh.com) to send an email indicating that you no longer wish to receive such communications. Please provide your name and physical and/or email address(es) at which you are receiving the unwanted communications.

Notice for Users Outside of the United States 

> You should be aware that the United States and other countries have not harmonized their privacy regulations.

By using the Veoh Service, you agree to the level of privacy protection set out in our Privacy Policy.
