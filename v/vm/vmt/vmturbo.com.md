# Privacy Policy | VMTurbo

VMTurbo, Inc. (“us”, “we”, “VMTurbo”) is committed to respecting the privacy of our customers, visitors, and other users of the VMTurbo website (“Site”). This notice describes our privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”), which covers the personal and other information that we collect on the Site. By visiting our Site, you accept the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy. If we do, we will notify you by posting the amended policy on our Site and, if we are authorized to send you email, notifying you of the nature of the modifications along with a link to the modified document so that you can review it. In all cases, use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.

**Information Collected on the Site**  
Information You Provide to Us. We may receive and electronically store any personal information you enter on our Site or provide to us in any other way, for example, your name, email address, or phone number submitted when you request information about our products and services or register for our mailing lists or webinars. The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services and communicating with you about new product and service offerings, including, without limitation, via email.

**Automatically Collected Traffic Data and Statistics**  
When you visit the Site, web servers may collect general information about your visit (such as, for example, the time and date of your visit, or the address of the website from which you entered the Site), which is stored as anonymous, aggregate data (“Traffic Data”). The collection of such Traffic Data may entail the use of cookies, IP addresses or other numeric codes used to identify a computer. VMTurbo may use Traffic Data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site. Your IP address is not linked to personally identifiable information, but is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve the Site. You may, at your option, expense and responsibility, set your browser to refuse cookies or delete cookies from your computer but doing so may prohibit you from making full use of the Site.

**Sharing of Information**  
Currently, VMTurbo will not share your personal information with any third parties except if (1) reasonably necessary to provide requested services to you, (2) authorized by you, or (3) VMTurbo is required to do so by law or regulation, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (a) to conform or comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, (b) to enforce our Terms of Service, or (c) to protect or defend the rights or property of VMTurbo or any other user.

VMTurbo may transfer information about you to another company in connection with a merger, sale or acquisition by or of VMTurbo. In that event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**Email Communications**  
You may receive emails from us if you subscribe to our mailing lists or otherwise request information regarding our products, services, or specific VMTurbo events. We respect your time and attention by limiting the frequency of our mailings. If you do not wish to receive further emails from us, simply follow the instructions at the bottom of any email to opt out of receiving future messages. If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email from VMTurbo or purporting to be from VMTurbo, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to marketing@vmturbo.com.

**Security**  
Information collected by VMTurbo is stored in secure operating environments that are not made generally available to the public. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, VMTurbo cannot ensure the security of any information you provide, and you do so at your own risk. Once VMTurbo receives your transmission, it will make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on its systems.

**Third Party Sites**  
The Site may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to our Site. These other websites are not under VMTurbo’s control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and VMTurbo is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you to visit those third party websites for more information regarding their specific practices.

**Contacts**  
If you have any comments, concerns or questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [legal@vmturbo.com](mailto:legal@vmturbo.com).
