		<p>VMware respects the privacy of our customers, business partners and employees. We recognize the need for appropriate protections and management of your personal information that you provide to us. VMware has therefore established this Privacy Statement to assist you to understand what information we collect and how that information is used.

		<p>Personal Information is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or email address. VMware may collect certain personal information from customers, business partners, employees and candidates for employment. VMware does not collect personal information when you visit VMware's web sites unless you choose to provide such personal information.</p>
<p>On VMware web sites you can order products or services, register products, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register to a secure extranet site to obtain access to product information, support, services and training, or apply for jobs at VMware. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit card or other financial information, contact preferences, educational and employment background, job interest data and benefit choices.</p>
<p>VMware also collects personal information of its employees (human resources data) in connection with administration of its Human Resources programs and functions. These programs and functions include compensation and benefit programs, performance appraisals, training, business travel, expense and tuition reimbursement, identification cards, access to VMware facilities and computer networks, employee profiles, internal employee directories, Human Resource recordkeeping, and other employment related purposes. VMware employees can go on-line to access their personal profile, job related data, compensation and benefit information, to make benefit elections and transactions and to make changes to their personal information.<br><br><a href="#">To top</a></p>

		<div class="barblue"><h4>How does VMware use personal information?</h4></div>
		<p>VMware will use personal information to provide customers and business partners with information and services and to help us better understand your needs and interests. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to deliver products/services to you, to bill you for products/services you purchased, and to provide ongoing service and support. Occasionally we may use your information to contact you to complete surveys that we use for marketing and quality assurance purposes. Personal information collected online may be combined with information you provide to VMware through other sources such as trade shows or seminars.</p>
<p>VMware may share your personal information with third parties in responding to your requests for products or services or product evaluations. Also, we may on occasion allow selected partners to send you special offers in blind mailings. Generally, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared with these third parties. However, if you request information on any of our products/services, VMware may provide your information to third party distributors and resellers who may subsequently contact you directly to purchase such products/services. In these instances, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of having your information shared with these third party distributors and resellers.</p>
<p>Some of VMware's websites make on-line newsgroups available to our users. Any information that is disclosed in these newsgroups becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. VMware may, from time to time, send email regarding our products and services to users who have posted to our newsgroups. Each participant's opinion expressed in a newsgroup is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of VMware.</p>
<p>To the extent that VMware uses personal information to email you about our product and services, VMware's email practices are in compliance with the U.S. and E.U. SPAM laws. Information about the U.S. and E.U. SPAM laws can be found at <a href="http://www.spamlaws.com/">http://www.spamlaws.com/</a>.</p>
<p>VMware uses personal information to consider candidates for employment opportunities within VMware. VMware uses personal information about its employees in connection with the administration of its Human Resources programs and functions and for purpose of communicating with its employees.</p>
<p>Except as provided in this Statement, VMware does not use your personal information for a purpose other than the stated purpose for which such information is collected.</p>
<p>Personal information given to VMware may be transferred across state and country borders for data consolidation, storage and simplified information management.<br><br><a href="#">To top</a></p>
