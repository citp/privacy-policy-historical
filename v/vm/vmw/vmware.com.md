**What personal information does VMware collect from me?**  
Personal information is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. VMware collects personal information in several ways from different parts of our Web site. On our Web site, you can order products or services, access support services, download evaluation products, request information or register VMware products. In connection with these and other uses of our Web site, VMware may collect your personal information, such as contact information and financial information. If you contact VMware we may keep a record of that correspondence. Please be aware that our Web site may contain links to VMware partner or other Web sites. Those Web sites may collect personally identifiable information about you. VMware is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those Web sites. **What are cookies and how does VMware use them?**  
VMware uses [cookies](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/cookie.htm) to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All areas of the VMware site where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. (See "What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?" for more information on cookies.) Generally, we use cookies to: 

  * Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or sign in and is modified when you sign out of our site. 
  * Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of VMware's Web site you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our site. 

VMware also collects [IP addresses](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html) for system administration. **How does VMware use my personal information?**  
VMware uses your personal information to provide you with products and services, to better understand your needs and interests and to facilitate your use of and purchases from the VMware Store. If you request something from our Web site, for example a product or service, a product evaluation, or support services, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. In connection with product and service purchases, contact information is used to ship products to you and financial information is used to bill you for those products and services. Occasionally we may use your information to contact you to complete surveys that we use for marketing purposes. VMware conducts research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files, or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Personal information collected online may also be combined with information you provide to VMware through other sources such as trade shows or seminars. **With whom does VMware share my information?**  
VMware will not sell or rent your personal information to others. VMware may share your personal information with third parties in responding to your requests for products or services or product evaluations. Also, we may on occasion allow selected partners to send you special offers in blind mailings. Generally, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared with these third parties. However, if you request or download an evaluation copy of any of our products, VMware may provide your information to third party distributors and resellers who may subsequently contact you directly to purchase VMware products or services. In connection with these requests for evaluation copies of VMware products, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of having your information shared with these third party distributors and resellers. Any user statistics that we may provide partners regarding VMware product or service usage are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user. VMware could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or some or all of its assets could be acquired. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers. VMware's intent is to seek appropriate protection for personal information in these types of transactions. **What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?**  
VMware may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. Only VMware (or agents working on behalf of VMware and under confidentiality agreements) or VMware distributors or resellers will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time, you can edit your [VMware account information](https://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/newstore/login.jsp) to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your VMware ID and password in order to access your [VMware account information](https://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/newstore/login.jsp). You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. **What is VMware's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?**  
You may edit your [VMware account information](https://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/newstore/login.jsp) at any time by using your VMware ID and password. If you have forgotten your password, please [click here to retrieve your password](https://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/newstore/forgot_password.jsp). **How does VMware protect my information?**  
Keeping your information private is very important to us. Please note that there are several places on the VMware Web site where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. By default, any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. If you are not able to use SSL encryption, VMware offers you the option of providing this information in other ways, including by fax and over a non-secure Web connection. **How can I protect my privacy on the VMware newsgroups?**  
VMware makes [newsgroups](https://web.archive.org/support/using/newsgroups.html) available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. VMware may, from time to time, send email regarding our products and services to users who have posted to our newsgroups. Each participant's opinion expressed in a newsgroup is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of VMware. **Can this privacy policy change?**  
VMware may revise this privacy policy. This privacy policy was last updated on February 4, 2003. If there are updates to the terms of this privacy policy, we will post the revised policy and update the revision date in this paragraph. For material changes to this privacy policy, VMware will provide notification to affected customers. Please review this policy periodically to be apprised of any updates.
