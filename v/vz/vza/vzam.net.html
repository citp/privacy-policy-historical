            <p class="body">Verizon Wireless strives to maintain high standards 
              for the protection of privacy over the Internet. The purpose of 
              this statement is to explain to our visitors the type of information 
              Verizon Wireless obtains about visitors to our websites, how we 
              gather it, how we use it, how long we retain it, and how visitors 
              can restrict the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information.</p>
                       
            <p class="body">
              <span class="secheadline2">Information We Collect:</span><br>
              The personal information Verizon Wireless obtains about individual 
              visitors to our websites is information the visitor supplies voluntarily. 
              This means that you can visit our websites without telling us who 
              you are or revealing any information about yourself. To gauge the 
              effectiveness of our websites, we do collect some generic information 
              about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's 
              domain name (such as .com, .edu, etc.), the web page from which 
              a visitor enters our site, which pages a visitor visits on our site, 
              and how much time a visitor spends on each page. We use web beacons 
              (a.k.a. clear gifs) to track use of our site and to track what sites 
              users came from and go to after leaving our site. We do not track 
              user activity on sites outside of Verizon Wireless. We aggregate 
              this information and use it to evaluate and improve our websites.</p>
            <p class="body">Verizon Wireless may collect personally identifiable 
              information (such as name, email address, postal address) and/or 
              third party personally identifiable information through this website. 
              You may choose to provide individual information to Verizon Wireless 
              in a number of ways through our website such as by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="body">Ordering a product or service from us;</li>
              <li class="body">Sending us e-mail;</li>
              <li class="body">Registering to receive news, public policy updates; 
                or information about our products;</li>
              <li class="body">Applying for a job or a grant;</li>
              <li class="body">Entering a contest. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body">
              When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific 
              purpose, Verizon Wireless uses the information for that purpose 
              (such as to provide the information the visitor has requested or 
              to consider a visitor for a particular job). When visitors use our 
              websites to order services, or to request information about them, 
              we may use the individual information as we would use the same information 
              obtained off-line - for example, to evaluate your service needs 
              and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. 
              You have the right to choose not to receive this information by 
              notifying us of your preference.</p>
            <p class="body">When a user wants to set up an account with Verizon 
              Wireless, in order to determine the user's credit worthiness, we 
              use their name, date of birth, and social security number to request 
              a credit report from a credit-reporting agency. Once we determine 
              a user's credit-worthiness, this document is destroyed.</p>
            <p class="body">We do not sell individual information obtained on-line 
              about our visitors. And, we will not disclose the individual information 
              provided to us on-line to anyone outside of Verizon Wireless unless 
              you specifically authorize it, it is required by law, or disclosure 
              is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. 
              If you provide individual information to us in the context of an 
              event Verizon Wireless sponsors with another company, such as a 
              contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you 
              may also be providing the information to the co-sponsor. In those 
              circumstances, the co-sponsor's privacy policy will control, so 
              review their information carefully. Verizon Wireless from time to 
              time uses third party contractors to perform services such as website 
              management, site design, site hosting and special promotions but 
              does not use user information for other purposes beyond providing 
              specific services on Verizon Wireless website.</p>
            <p class="body"><br>
              <span class="secheadline2">Email:</span><br>
              Verizon Wireless does not send unsolicited "junk" email 
              (spam). We may use email to communicate with our customers, to respond 
              to visitors' emails, to confirm orders placed online, and to send 
              information that a visitor has requested. If you receive an unwanted 
              email from us, you can simply reply to ask not to receive future 
              emails.</p>
            <p class="body">Verizon Wireless provides an unsubscribe function 
              in its email campaigns in order for subscribers to opt out of further 
              email communications from us.</p>
            <p class="body"><br>
              <span class="secheadline2">Use of Cookies:</span><br>
              Verizon Wireless websites also use "cookies". They allow 
              us to serve you better. When you use our site we send information, 
              a cookie, to your computer and it is stored there. When you return 
              to our site, your computer sends the cookie back to us. This allows 
              our server to recognize your computer and any settings you created 
              on our site. It restores those settings so you don't have to enter 
              the same information every time you visit. For example, if you entered 
              your zip code on a visit to our site, when you return you will see 
              information for that zip code without typing it in again. The fact 
              that our server recognizes your computer when it retrieves the cookies 
              does not mean that Verizon Wireless is actually acquiring information 
              about you. You can set your browser to delete cookies or to tell 
              you before you accept one. Look in your browser's Options or Preferences 
              menu.</p>

              to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we 
              have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply 
              with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process
