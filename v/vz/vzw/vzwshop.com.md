TRUSTe is an independent organization that seeks to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Verizon wants you to feel confident about your privacy when you use our Web sites (verizon.com, verizonmarketing.com, verizonwireless.com, mci.com, verizonbusiness.com, vzw.com, vzwshop.com, and verizon.net) so we ask TRUSTe to review these sites to ensure compliance with its guidelines.

Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/customersupport/contactus/) if you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy. If you have not received acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been addressed satisfactorily, you should [contact TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/about/contacts.php) who then will serve as a liaison to help resolve your concerns.

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through Verizon's Web sites and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the sites.

This Code represents sound advertising and selling practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in a business. With regard to safeguarding privacy, the BBB Code requires accredited businesses to protect any data they collect against mishandling and fraud, collect personal information only as needed, and respect the preferences of customers regarding the use of their information.
