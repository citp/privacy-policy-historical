# Privacy Policies | Verizon

At Verizon, we are committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy protections for customers. Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect, how we use it, and your options about certain uses of information.

Verizon's privacy policy applies to website visitors and customers of the Verizon family of companies in the United States. Additional privacy practices that apply to Fios, Verizon Wireless, AOL and hum services are also described in the full policy. Supplemental privacy policies for AOL companies and the services they provide are described in the AOL privacy policy. In the event of a conflict between the Verizon privacy policy and the AOL privacy policy, the AOL policy will control when you are on an AOL site or using an AOL product or service.

Below, we've summarized key elements from our [full privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy) for your convenience.

##### Information we collect and how it is used

Verizon collects and uses information about our customers and website visitors when you interact with us, when you use our products and services, and when you visit our websites. This information is used to deliver, provide and repair products or services; establish and maintain customer accounts and billing records; contact you about our products and services and direct offers or promotions to you; monitor website statistics; and manage and protect our networks. Information may also be aggregated or de-identified for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.

We may also obtain consumer information from outside companies who provide such data. We use this data and combine it with other information we have to help us analyze customer information, predict customer preferences and direct marketing offers.
