# vgy.me - Simple Image Hosting

This Privacy Policy has been created to allow you, the user/visitor, to better understand how the data we collect is used on our website, vgy.me.

  


####  **What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?**

We collect IP addresses and what pages/uploads a user has visited. The purpose of this is to understand where most of our traffic comes from so we can provide a better service in terms of speed, performance and loading times.

  


####  **When do we collect information?**

We collect information when you register as a user on our website, where we ask for a username and e-mail address.

We collect feedback/suggestions which can help improve the website for all.

Whenever you visit a page on our website, or when you view an upload, either from our website directly or from a 3rd party (such as a hotlinked image on a forum).

  


####  **How do we use your information?**

The information is used solely to improve vgy.me, it is never sold or given to 3rd party providers:

  * If you register as a user on our website, we ask for your e-mail address, for the purpose of resetting your password if you have forgotten it. You will also receive an e-mail requesting you to activate your account. This is so we can be sure if you need to reset your password, a new password can be sent to you via e-mail securely. 
  * In some cases, we may use your e-mail address to check against logs with our mail service - this is usually only the case when a user hasn't received their activation/password reset e-mail. We can check to see why the e-mail wasn't sent and let the user know.
  * To improve our website in order to better serve you.
  * To follow up with them after correspondence (live chat, email or phone inquiries), after which any trace of communication is deleted.
  * When moderating our site, we may use your information to link to other pieces of information, such as uploads. This is only if a user/IP address has been caught violating our Terms of Service. 
  * We never add you to a mailing list upon registering to our website, we never send e-mails for marketing purposes.
