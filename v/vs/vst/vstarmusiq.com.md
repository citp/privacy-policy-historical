Terms Of Service

Information Collection & Use

VstarMusiQ requires users to register for the service and provide personal information including but not limited to the user’s name, zip code and email address. VstarMusiQ uses this information to establish and deliver service to the individual. VstarMusiQ may use this information to contact registered users to notify them of product and service updates, provide instruction, and to deliver other service related information. VstarMusiQ may also contact users to request additional information and feedback. VstarMusiQ may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its behalf, and will need to share personal information with these agents to establish and deliver service to the individual. VstarMusiQ’s agents do not receive any right to use personal information beyond what is necessary to perform these tasks.

VstarMusiQ will not disclose registration information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with VstarMusiQ, without your consent or as otherwise stated in this privacy policy. If at some point VstarMusiQ sells all or a portion of its assets, customer information is one of those assets that would be transferred or acquired by a third party; the third party would then have the right to continue using the personal information as set forth in this policy. For more information see VstarMusiQ’s Privacy Policy Changes section below.

VstarMusiQ may release or exchange personal information if required to do so to comply with applicable law or to enforce its rights or agreements or prevent fraud or reduce credit risk. In addition, VstarMusiQ may contact you to inform you of updates or new features. If you wish to be removed from such secondary mailings you may do so by the means provided in the email.

VstarMusiQ may automatically collect and analyze information regarding the use of VstarMusiQ’s services and VstarMusiQ site activity. Information collected may include but is not limited to web site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser and operating system, etc. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, administer the site, and improve the quality and types of service delivered. VstarMusiQ may also collect, track and analyze information that does not personally identify a user in aggregate form. This aggregate data will be used at VstarMusiQ’s discretion and may be shared with third parties, but with no personally identifiable information attached. Registered users will be using the site to host relationship data. Relationship data sent to VstarMusiQ servers by the user will remain the property of the user. VstarMusiQ will not review, share, distribute or reference such data except as may be required to provide the requested VstarMusiQ services, or as provided in the VstarMusiQ Terms of Use Agreement, or as may be required by law.

If a user elects to use VstarMusiQ’s invite service for reaching a person via the VstarMusiQ site, we will generate an automatic email that is sent to them. We will automatically send this person an email inviting them to visit the site if they are not a user or if they are a user we will send that an email to ask them to visit the site or respond to the invite. If the individual does not respond we do not send any reminder emails. We do not store this information for public use. The emails are for the sole purpose of notifying individuals about upcoming sports events.

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code or email), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. If not easily available online, this can be done by emailing our customer support at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
