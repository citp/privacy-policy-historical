# VS PINK::Terms and Conditions

### Privacy

This privacy policy is intended to assist you in understanding what information we gather about you when you visit VSPINK.com, how we use that information, and the safeguards we have in place for the information. This privacy policy applies only to the information collected online at vspink.com and other VSPINK Web sites that display or explicitly adopt this policy.

What type of information does VSPINK.COM collect online?

 _General Browsing:_

VSPINK.com gathers information about the technical efficiencies of our Web site and services (i.e., time to connect to our Web site, time to download, etc.). We may also gather non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) which will provide information regarding use of our Web site (such as the time of the last visit to a page on our site). We also gather navigational information about where visitors go on our Web site. The navigational information we gather will allow us to improve the quality of our Web site by recognizing and delivering more of the features, areas and services our visitors prefer.

 _Collection of Personal Information:_

If you click on the link to sign up for Victoria's Secret e-mail so that you receive information about PINK products, events and promotions, you will be taken to the VictoriasSecret.com Web site where your information will be collected. Categories of information collected when you sign up for Victoria's Secret e-mail may include your name, mailing address and e-mail address.

VSPINK.com will collect personal information from you if you enter the online contests or sweepstakes that may be offered at this Web site. This information may include your name, mailing address and e-mail address. We may also offer special surveys, quizzes or polls at this Web site and aggregate the answers provided by all participants in each quiz, poll or survey to help us better understand our customers. We may collect personal information you enter when taking a quiz or poll.

VSPINK.com will collect personal information from you if you sign up to receive information about our products, promotions and events through text messaging. This information will include your name and cell phone number.

To ensure compliance with federal law, VSPINK.COM does not knowingly collect or maintain information provided by children under the age of 13.

How does VSPINK.COM use the information collected online?

The information we collect online when you sign up is used to deliver information to you about VSPINK products, promotions and events. It may also be used to enter you in our sweepstakes from time to time. If you complete a separate sweepstakes entry but have not signed up to receive Victoria's Secret e-mail, we may use the information you provide to enter the sweepstakes (for example, name and e-mail address) to deliver information to you about PINK products, promotions and events.

We may use third party vendors to help us provide services to you, such as monitoring site activity, contacting you about our products, promotions and events, conducting surveys, maintaining our database and administering and monitoring e-mails, sweepstakes, drawings or contests and administering and sending text messages. These third party service providers are required to maintain your information in confidence.

If you signed up to become a VSPINK Insider prior to March 1, 2006, we have not and will not share your information with any third parties other than our third party service providers. If you sign up to receive Victoria's Secret e-mail after February 28, 2006 (by clicking the sign up link and being taken to VictoriasSecret.com), VictoriasSecret.com will use your information to send you updates about Victoria's Secret and VSPINK products, promotions and events. Your sign up information provided after February 28, 2006 will be shared with our sister companies (for example, Bath and Body Works and Express), so that our sister companies may send you information about their products as well. Furthermore, your sign up information provided after February 28, 2006 will be added to the Victoria's Secret print catalogue mailing list and as a result of being added to the Victoria's Secret print catalogue mailing list, your name and mailing address, sometimes categorized by purchasing information, may be made available to companies whose products you may find of interest. If you prefer to not have your name and mailing address that is included in our print catalogue mailing list provided to third parties, please [click here](http://www2.victoriassecret.com/html/custsrvc/contact/personalinfo/). Because VictoriasSecret.com will collect and use information you provide during sign up, we encourage you to also review the [VictoriasSecret.com privacy policy](http://www2.victoriassecret.com/html/common/security_privacy.html). Click [here](http://www2.victoriassecret.com/html/common/security_privacy.html) to view the VictoriasSecret.com privacy policy. If you sign up to receive text messages from VSPINK, we will not share your cell phone number with any third party so that they may send you text messages, but we may share your cell phone number for other purposes.

If you no longer wish to receive marketing e-mails about VSPINK or Victoria's Secret products, promotions or events for which you were registered via VSPINK.COM or VictoriasSecret.com, please follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of the next e-mail you receive from VSPINK or Victoria's Secret. Please note that if you opt-out of receiving marketing e-mails from VSPINK, you will also opt-out of receiving marketing e-mails from Victoria's Secret and vice versa. Asking to be removed from our marketing e-mail list will not prevent you from receiving e-mail communications relating to online orders, requests to participate in surveys about our products, or other operational e-mails. If you no longer wish to receive marketing materials specifically about Victoria's Secret or PINK by regular mail, please call us at 800-376-0579. If you no longer wish to receive text messages about products, promotions or events from VSPINK, you may respond to any text message that you receive with STOP.

Special stand-alone programs or lines of business (like PINK Nation) have their own subscribe and unsubscribe procedures, which we will specifically note when you subscribe. As a result, the preferences you specify for VSPINK and Victoria's Secret, e.g., email, postal mail, and text messages, as described above (including opt-out), will not affect these special programs; and the preferences you specify in a special program will not affect VSPINK or Victoria's Secret preferences (including opt-out). Please follow the special program instructions for specifying your subscribe and unsubscribe preferences.

You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Web site, the site or the public.
