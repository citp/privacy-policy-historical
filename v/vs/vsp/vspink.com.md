These brands and lines of business include Victoria's Secret, Victoria's Secret Pink, and Pink Nation By "personal information" we mean your identifying information (like name, home address, and email address), and descriptive information (like tastes and preferences) if coupled with your identifying information ("personally identifying information"). We may refer to all our brands and lines of business (i.e., Victoria's Secret, Victoria's Secret Pink, and Pink Nation) as "we," "us," or "our" throughout this privacy policy.

  * What is the policy for visitors from outside the U.S.?
  * How do you update your personal information?
  * How do we address children's privacy?
  * How do we secure your information on our site?
  * Whom may you contact with questions or concerns?
  * Who administers this policy?
  * When was this policy last updated?



###  What personal information is collected at our web site and how is it used?

  1. ####  1\.  Information Collected Directly from You and Others through this Site

We collect personal information directly from you to do all the things typically associated with Web sites. Examples of the information we collect include name, address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, personal preferences, credit card number, purchase and ordering information, demographical information, responses to survey questions and sizing information.

This information is collected at various places: for instance, when you check out with your online order; subscribe to catalogs, email offers, and mobile messaging offers; participate in surveys; join Victoria's Secret Pink Nation; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers.

We collect information about you. And, when you provide it, we collect information about those you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We use this information to do things like:

    * process your online orders;
    * open an online account at your request;
    * personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests;
    * provide customer service, whether it's responding to a request or following up on an order;
    * include you in surveys and contests;
    * enable you to post your content, such as comments or images;
    * facilitate networks of online social activity centered around our products and services;
    * improve our website, improve the manner in which offers are made on our website, improve purchase decisions of our visitors and the interactions visitors have with our website;
    * enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our Web environment, or by viewing our content within their Web environment; and
    * market products and services for each of our brands--for instance, by adding you to the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret Pink email list or Victoria's Secret print-catalog list when you make an online purchase; or by adding you to the Pink Nation email list if you sign up for Pink Nation.
  2. ####  2\.  Information We Observe or Collect through Technology

    1. #####  a.  Navigational Information

When you visit this Web site, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.

    2. #####  b.  Cookies and Clear gifs

To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Web site, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, personalize your online experience, and personalize offers to you based on your unique tastes and purchase history.

We also use clear-gifs (also known as a Web beacon or Web bug) on our Web site and in our emails. A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Web site or email in question is viewed. Clear gifs in e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience. Overall, these technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most–for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Web site. Cookies and clear gifs also allow us to associate your online navigational or transactional information with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses and email address). We'll associate this information only for our purposes: to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.

  3. ####  3\.  Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology

Third-party service providers help us provide certain features on our site and analyze our visitor's site and purchase preferences. They may also help us deliver ads to you about our products through banner ads when you visit other web sites (often referred to as "online network advertising"). The following provides more information about these service providers and the choices you have with respect to their services.

    1. #####  a.  Features

We use third-party services to provide certain features on our Web site. These third parties use some or all of the technologies described in Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology to provide these features.

    2. #####  b.  Analysis

We contract with analytics companies to better understand your use of our Web sites, and Web capabilities like embeddable widgets. These third parties may serve surveys to determine satisfaction with the Web site and then tie the responses to actual behavior on the Web site, which will allow us to improve our Web sites and Web capabilities. They accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology.

    3. #####  c.  Advertising

We contract with third-party advertising companies that, in turn, collect non-personally identifying information by placing cookies on your browser when you visit us here. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, credit card information, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visit to deliver our ads on this and other Web sites through their online advertising networks. These companies also provide this information to us which we, in turn, use to gauge how effective our ads are. If you'd like more information about how online network advertising works and what your choices are for the information that's collected via these third-party cookies, please see What Choices do you have Over how Your Information is Used?

###  How does this web site interact with third-party Web sites and content?

We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content. We do this for your convenience. We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices. Whether the third-party content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Web site for another site to view it, those service provider's terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless there's a conspicuously posted statement by us that says otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.

Here's a partial list of the sites or content of these third parties:

  1. #####  a.  Interactive Maps

We may facilitate easy access to the online maps of content providers like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! There you can get quick location, driving, and contact information for our stores.

  2. #####  b.  Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites

We may rely on the expertise of third-party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Navigation to these sites may be seamless so that it appears you're still in our Web site environment. In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.

  3. #####  c.  Social Networking or Other User-Generated-Content Sites, and Other Websites

We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites, like social networking sites and other sites that host user-generated content. This may include easy click-through access or even "single sign-on" to these sites. The third-party's privacy policy applies to any personal information you provide at these sites.

  4. #####  d.  The Angel Credit Card Site

We enable you to navigate easily to the site of World Financial Network Bank (WFNNB), where you can apply for the Angel card and pay invoices online. WFNNB issues and owns the Angel credit card accounts. When you apply online for an Angel credit card or pay your account online, you leave our site and interact directly with WFNNB. Any information you provide to WFNNB is subject to WFNNB's terms, conditions, and policies, including its privacy policy.

  5. #####  e.  Third-Party Rewards or Membership Programs

We may interact with certain unrelated companies that offer their customers memberships to participate in programs, which may include rewards for purchases from us. If you become a member of one of these programs or purchase something from us at this Web site through such a program, we may provide the company administering the membership program enough information about you or your purchase (like contact information, transaction date, transaction amount, and order number), to enable it to honor your membership. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies sponsoring these membership programs. Their terms, conditions, and policies apply to any information that's provided to them to further their programs.

We use third-party "back-office" contractors to help handle parts of our business because of their expertise, resources, or scale.

Contractors may also assist us in hosting microsites and mobile Web sites where you may provide personal information about you and others you know; and where they may observe information about you in the same way as described above (see What Personal Information Is Collected At Our Web Site, and How Is It Used?)

  3. #####  c.  Other Marketers

We may share your name, postal address, and summary purchase information with other merchants and merchant exchanges.

###  What choices do you have over how your information is used?

  1. #####  a.  Email

If you make an online purchase you may receive Victoria's Secret or Victoria's Secret Pink email. You may stop future delivery of these emails by following the removal instructions located at the bottom of each commercial email or by completing the [removal from e-mail form](http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?a=0&aid=477251442&email=&fp_redirected=1). If you have joined Pink Nation, you may receive Pink Nation email. If at any time you'd like to stop future delivery of Pink Nation email offers, simply follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each Pink Nation message. Opting out of any of these email will not stop operational or transactional messages such as email confirmations of your online orders, or customer service communications from the brand or line of business in question. We may occasionally provide you with the opportunity to opt in to receive email messages from third parties. If you do opt in, we'll share your e-mail address with the specific third party in question. Please review their privacy policies to see how they treat your personal information.

  2. #####  b.  Mobile Messaging

If you've signed up for mobile text messaging offers (e.g., from Victoria's Secret or Pink Nation) but later decide you no longer wish to receive offers from one or both of these brands or lines of business, simply follow the opt-out instructions included in the mobile message.

  3. #####  c.  Postal Mail: Catalogs

If you'd like to specify your preferences for our catalogues (including or postal-mail offers), simply follow the instructions on each such catalogue, or dial 1-800-411-5116.

  4. #####  d.  Victoria's Secret Pink Nation

Please keep in mind that Pink Nation is a separate and stand-alone program, which you may join by visiting the Pink Nation Web site. Accordingly, your unsubscribe preferences for Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret Pink won't affect your Pink Nation preferences (and vice versa). Please specify those preferences separately.

  5. #####  e.  Cookies, Clear Gifs, and Online Network Advertising

You may always choose to block cookies or even clear cookies from your computer. Simply follow your browser's instructions on how to block and clear cookies. Note that blocking cookies may not block the "first-party" cookies that are placed on your computer when you visit this site. By first-party cookies, we mean those cookies (whether placed by us or a contractor) that help us see how visitors use our site, and enable us to deliver our ads on our site (as opposed to ads on an online advertising network of third-party Web sites). Clearing cookies after each visit here will prevent observations from multiple sessions being aggregated over time. Please consider the consequences of blocking or clearing cookies. Many Web sites rely on their cookies to provide you with services or features that you have requested or expect. With respect to cookies used as part of a survey, if you do not want the use of cookies to associate survey responses with your behavior on the site, you can elect to not take the survey. If you want more information about online network advertising, in general, including access to some online network advertisers that allow you to designate your preferences, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) (you'll leave this site for a centrally managed online site where you can specify your preference).

If you don't want your basic contact and purchase information shared with other marketers (other than our affiliates), please [click here](https://web.archive.org/CustomerService/QuickHelp/ContactUs/NonDisclosureOfPersonalInformation).
