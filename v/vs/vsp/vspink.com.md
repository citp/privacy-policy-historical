# Victoria's Secret Online Privacy Policy

Unless indicated otherwise, this Policy applies only to personal information collected through the websites, microsites, mobile applications, and other online services of our brands and lines of business that expressly adopt, and display or link to, this Policy (collectively, the “Services”).

We refer to Victoria's Secret Stores Brand Management, Inc., Four Limited Parkway, Reynoldsburg, OH 43068, including the associated retail brands, Victoria's Secret, Victoria's Secret Pink (or "Pink"), and Pink Nation (by Pink) as "we," "us," or "our" throughout this Policy.

##  What information is collected and how is it used?

  1. ### 1. Information You Actively Provide through our Services

You actively provide personal information when you visit our Services to do all the things typically associated with online services. Examples of the personal information we collect include name, address, phone number, email address, personal preferences, payment card number, purchase and ordering information, demographic information, responses to survey questions, sizing information and any other information you choose to provide. Our Services may also give you the option to upload or share pictures or videos of yourself and others. You know what information you directly provide, because you are affirmatively and actively submitting the information.

This information is collected at various places on our Services: for instance, when you check out with your online order; engage with our mobile applications; subscribe to catalogs, email offers, and mobile messaging offers; participate in surveys; join Victoria's Secret Pink Nation; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers.

We may also collect information that you provide on our Services about people you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We may also collect contact information about your friends and family members when you participate in one of our refer-a-friend programs. In these instances, we may send a message to your friend or family member on your behalf. Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals with whom you have a personal or family relationship and who would want to receive the message from you.

  2. ###  2. Information Your Devices Provide Automatically

    1. #### a. Location Information

You may provide information about your location when you access or use our Services. For more details, please see What choices do you have over how your information is used? below.

    2. #### b. Navigational Information

When you access our Services, your computer, phone, or other device provides navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site or online service from which you came, and the site or online service to which you navigate.

    3. #### c. Device Information

You also provide information about the computer or mobile device used to access our Services, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website or app usage behavior.

    4. #### d. Cookies, Clear Gifs and Similar Technologies

To better understand how you interact with our Services, we may collect information using cookies, clear-gifs (also known as web beacons or web bugs) and similar technologies. We deliver a customized experience and do not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals of web browsers.

A cookie is a small amount of data that's stored by your browser on your device. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Services, what you click on, remember you and your online purchases when you return, and recognize you and honor a special deal for you, when you redeem one of our offers from a third party's site. This helps us improve and deliver our Services, provide better customer service, tailor and improve your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) interactions and purchase history.

A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a web page, web-based document or email message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time the site, document or email in question is viewed; and recognize you and honor a special deal for you, when you navigate from a third party's site to redeem one of our offers that may have appeared there. Clear gifs in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized or better online experience. 

In addition to cookies and clear gifs, we may also use device identifiers, web storage, and other technologies to collect information about your interactions with our content and Services.

The above technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most: for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Services. Cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address). We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services on this and other online services, and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.

For information about your options with respect to cookies, see What choices do you have over how your information is used? below.

  3. ### 3. Purposes of Information Collection

We use personal information about you, which is collected through the Services to:

    * process your online orders;
    * open an online account at your request;
    * personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests;
    * provide customer service, whether it's responding to a request or following up on an order;
    * include you in surveys and contests;
    * enable you to post your content, such as comments, images or videos;
    * facilitate networks of online social activity centered around our products and services;
    * improve our Services, the manner in which offers are made on our Services, the purchase decisions of our visitors, and the interactions visitors have with our Services;
    * improve your experience with our Services: for example through faster, better, smarter, and more customized online interactions;
    * enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our online environment, or by viewing our content within their online environment;
    * market our products and services that may be of interest to you--for instance, we may add you to the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret Pink email list when you make an online purchase or sign up to receive emails; or we may add you to Victoria's Secret print-catalogue list when you make an online purchase or to the Pink Nation email list if you sign up for Pink Nation; and
    * create aggregated, pseudonomized or anonymized information for statistical purposes.



## Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology

We evaluate and select third-party service providers to help us provide certain features on our Services and analyze our visitors' preferences for us, through the use of such services as Google Analytics. These service providers may use some or all the technologies described above.

## How is technology used to serve our advertisements on other online services and what choices do you have?

We contract with third-party advertising companies, which may collect information about your use and interactions with the Services, over time and across third-party websites and online services, for use in delivering tailored online display and banner advertising to you on other websites and online services. To serve this advertising, these third-party companies place, use, or rely on the technologies described above, including cookies, clear gifs, device identifiers and similar technologies to obtain information about customer interactions with us through our Services and interactions with other online services. These companies use the information they collect to serve you ads that are targeted to your interests.

##  How do our Services interact with third-party services and content?

We link to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content through our Services. We do this for your convenience. We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties.

Here are examples of the types of third-party content and services available through or via our Services:

  1. ###  1. Interactive Maps

We may facilitate easy access to the online maps of content providers like Google. There you can get quick location, driving, and contact information for our stores.

  2. ###  2. Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites

We may rely on the expertise of third-party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Navigation to these sites may be seamless so that it appears you're still using our Services. In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.

  3. ###  3. Social Networking and other Third-Party Sites and Services

We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites and online services, like social networks and other services that host user-generated content. This may include easy click-through access, the ability for you to share content on third-party services, or even "single sign-on" to these services. The third-party's privacy policy applies to any information or content you provide through these services.

  4. ###  4. The Angel Credit Card Site

We enable you to navigate easily to the site of Comenity Bank (Comenity), where you can apply for the Angel card and pay invoices online. Comenity issues and owns the Angel credit card accounts.

Any information you provide to Comenity is subject to Comenity's terms, conditions, and policies, including its privacy policy.

  5. ###  5. International Checkout

We work with eShopWorld to sell and deliver our products to certain international destinations. If you are shipping to a country supported by eShopWorld, you will navigate away from our Services to a co-branded checkout service "powered by eShopWorld." eShopWorld's privacy policy, and not our Policy, will apply to information that you directly provide on that site, such as your payment information. Additionally, when you navigate to eShopWorld's checkout site, we will share information about you and your order with eShopWorld to facilitate your purchase of our products from eShopWorld. Please see eShopWorld's privacy policy for information about its privacy practices




##  What information do we share with third parties and our sister brands (or what information may they access because of the services they provide to us)?

  1. ###  1. Our Sister Brands

We will obtain your consent to this sharing in jurisdictions where it is legally required. If you don't want this information shared with our sister brands, follow the instructions below in What choices do you have over how your information is used?

  2. ###  2. Contractors

We use third-party service providers and contractors to help handle parts of our business because of their expertise, resources, or scale. They help us do things like fulfill orders, process payments, provide some customer service through chat features, monitor activity on our Services, serve surveys and provide analysis from the surveys (which could be combined with Services usage analytics), maintain databases, administer and monitor emails, administer and send mobile messages, serve ads on this and other Services and provide consulting services. Contractors may also assist us in hosting microsites, mobile websites and mobile applications where you may provide personal information about yourself and others you know; and where they may observe information about you in the same way as described above (see What Information Is Collected and How Is It Used?).

  3. ###  3. Other Marketers

We may share your name, postal address, and summary purchase information with other merchants and merchant exchanges. Other merchants may, in turn, use this information to send you offers for their products and services. We will obtain your consent for this sharing in jurisdictions where it is legally required. If you don't want this information shared with these merchants and exchanges, please[ click here](https://customerservice.victoriassecret.com/app/ask), and select Nondisclosure of Personal Information Request for the Email Subject and then complete the form.
