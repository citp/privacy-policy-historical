Relevant financial information. 

If you are applying for credit you will be asked for specific financial information. Softroute may keep a file with your contact history to be used for inquiry purposes so that we may ensure that you are satisfied with the services which we have provided to you. 

If you visit Softroute web sites, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. All information that you do provide us with is securely maintained and kept strictly confidential.
