<p>We may ask you for this personal information directly. We may also collect your personal information through the use of cookies, clear gifs, web beacons, and third party cookies for the purposes of (1) enhancing your experience of our websites, products and services, (2) providing certain features (such as advertising), or (3) tracking email or website usage and online activity.
