            </span>
          </p><div align="justify">

            <p align="justify"></p>
            <p align="justify">We will only use personal information for the purpose that we have disclosed to you. If we want to use your information for a different purpose, we will notify you and ask for your consent first. </p>
            <p align="justify"><span><strong>2.3 When We May Disclose Your Personal Information </strong><br>
          </span><span>Softroute is obliged to keep your personal information confidential except under the following circumstances:<br>
          <br>
          * When <strong>Authorized by You</strong><br>
          * When <strong>Required by Law<br>
          </strong>* When <strong>Permitted by Law</strong>          </span>
          </p><p align="justify">(i)<i>When Authorized by You</i><br>
          Many of the services offered by Softroute require us to obtain personal information about you in order to perform the services we have been engaged to provide. We will use this information to tailor products to meet your needs and objectives. We will always obtain consent from you first, and we will never use the information for purposes other than those we have told you about. </p>
            <p align="justify">(ii) <i>When Required by Law </i><br>
          The type of information we are legally required to disclose usually relates to government reporting requirements. However, in some cases, such as under a court order, we may be required to disclose certain information to persons specified in the court order. We will only provide the specific information requested and only upon being satisfied that the authorities have legitimate grounds to request the information. </p>
            <p align="justify">(iii) <i>When Permitted by Law </i><br>
          The legislation has provided certain situations where Softroute is legally permitted to disclose personal information without your consent. Examples include situations involving the collection of debt in arrears, or suspicion of illegal activities. </p>
