### _**Data Collected**_

_Data You Provide:_ We collect data that you provide to us when you interact with the Site or sites owned by third-parties with whom we have contractual relationships, including sites you visit prior to coming to this Site (" **Media Partners** "). In most cases when you come to the Site we will automatically gather or receive technical data about your prior journey, device and how you interact with our Site (" **Technical Data** "). Technical Data may include browser type, referrer URL, date and time of your visit, IP address, MAC address, device type, screen resolution, and OS version. Technical Data also includes "Cookie and Similar Data" described below.

We gather additional data if you elect to engage with the Site or certain sites owned by our Media Partners. This includes contact information you elect to provide (e.g., name, address, email address, telephone number) about yourself or third parties to us and our Media Partners. (For example, if you elect to click on one of our advertisements on a Media Partner's site that Media Partner may pass your contact information to us). We refer to the information you elect to provide as " **Provided Attributes.** " In addition to contact information, Provided Attributes include age, gender, occupation, and education level. The Provided Attributes we collect are based upon the product and services you are inquiring about. 

_Third Party Data:_ In some cases, we may augment the Technical Data and any Provided Attributes with Third Party Data. " **Third Party Data** " includes information from third parties such as credit reporting agencies. (We will only obtain credit reporting information with your consent, and will not retain any Social Security number you provide). Third Party Data may also include information intended to validate the data you provide (e.g., phone number, Vehicle Identification Number, outstanding loan amount). Finally, Third Party Data may include instances where you authorize us to use social media account information to log into or connect to this Site. We may combine the Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third Party Data.

_Cookie and Similar Data:_ When you use this Site, we may recognize you or your device through use of a "cookie" or other tracking technology. These technologies act as unique identifiers and allow us to tailor this Site to your specified interests and track your activity on this Site. This information may be added to your user profile and used to deliver offers and advertisements that we believe are relevant to your interests. 

We have contractual relationships with advertisers, advertising agencies and other intermediaries that have advertisers as clients (collectively, " **Advertising Partners** "). Our Media Partners and Advertising Partners (collectively, " **Partners** ") may also utilize third-party cookies and other tracking technologies like clear pixel GIFs (i.e., web beacons) to identify you. We and our Partners may use these technologies to measure responses to emails and page views on this Site and our Partners' websites. These technologies are used to enhance this Site, to make this Site more relevant to you, and to measure the effectiveness of our email and other advertising campaigns and those of our Partners. You can opt out of some of our and our Partners' use of cookies and other technologies at: [(Google)](https://www.google.com/settings/ads), [(the Network Advertising Initiative)](http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp), [(Invite Media)](http://assets.invitemedia.com/opt-out.html), and [(Clicktale)](http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html).

_Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures:_ Certain Sites require cookies to function efficiently. We may use cookies to deliver advertising we believe is relevant to you and to link data collected across other devices you use. You can adjust your setting to limit tracking or decline cookies, but, as a result, you may not be able to use certain features of this Site or take full advantage of all of our offerings. Please refer to your device or browser settings for more information on how to delete or decline cookies and control your tracking preferences. This Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals from most browsers.

### _**Data Use**_

We use the data we collect from and about you through this Site primarily to connect you with Advertising Partners who can provide you with information about the products and services you are seeking. We generally do this using Technical Data and Provided Attributes, but in certain cases (e.g. lending products) we may also use Third Party Data. 

For example, we may have an auto insurance Partner who is only licensed in certain states. We may use Technical Data or Provided Attributes to determine if you are a resident of one of those states. We refer to Advertising Partner requirements generally as "segmentation" and the alignment of consumer data and segments as "matching."

We may also use the data we collect from and about you to (i) respond to your requests (e.g., receive white papers, email, phone calls or texts); (ii) to keep you informed of our products and services (and those of our Partners); (iii) to allow you to send message through this Site; (iv) to improve our Sites and business; (v) to fulfill any purchase you make; and (vi) to use your data in an aggregated, non-specific format for analytic and demographic purposes.

We may use automated decision-making in segmentation and matching.

We may also disclose the data we collect from and about you to (i) comply with legal processes; (ii) to respond to lawful requests from authorities (including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, and including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements); (iii) to enforce our Terms of Service and this Privacy Notice; (iv) to protect our business, rights, privacy, safety, or property or that of others; and (v) as necessary under applicable law (including laws outside your country of residence).

### _**Information for California Consumers**_

The California Consumer Privacy Act (" **CCPA** ") affords certain rights and protections to California residents. This section is intended to further describe (i) the categories and sources of data that QuinStreet collects, sells or shares; (ii) the purpose for collection; (iii) the types of third parties to whom QuinStreet discloses that information; and (iv) details about how California residents can exercise their rights under the CCPA.

_Categories of Data QuinStreet Collects_ QuinStreet collects the following CCPA categories of data: (i) identifiers, such as a name, email address, telephone number, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, IP address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number; (ii) personal identifiers under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e), such as insurance policy number, education, employment status, bank account information, credit card or debit card number, financial information, medical information, health insurance information; (iii) protected classification characteristics under California law, such as age, marital status, medical condition, gender, veteran or military status; (iv) commercial information, such as products or services obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies; (v) internet activity, such as browsing history and search history information; (vi) geolocation data; (vii) professional or employment information, such as consumer-reported current or past job history; (viii) inferences drawn from some of the information above (e.g., email open rates and time).

QuinStreet generally collects the above data as Technical Data or Provided Attributes. For example, QuinStreet does not create user profiles to determine the gender, marital status or employment status of consumers. QuinStreet receives each of those categories of data only as self-reported data from the consumer.

_Data Sources._

_QuinStreet:_ QuinStreet collects Technical Data and Provided Attributes from consumers who land on or engage with our Sites, our call centers or other QuinStreet owned-properties (e.g., in response to emails from or on behalf of QuinStreet).

_Partners and Third Parties:_ Consumers who visit websites owned by our Media Partners may be redirected to our Sites. In some cases, we may gather data directly from Media Partner websites, or Media Partners or other third parties may post data to our Sites or otherwise transfer data to us. This may occur via display ads, click listings, inquiry forms or telephonic transfers from Media Partner call centers. Our Advertising Partners may also provide us with data.

_Service Providers:_ QuinStreet engages service providers to perform a variety of functions (e.g., verifying consumer consent, validating email addresses or phone numbers).

_Authorization:_ We require all parties from whom we receive data, whether they are Partners, Service Providers or other third parties, to represent and warrant to us that they have appropriately obtained the data provided to us and have the authority to share the data with us.

_Purpose for Data Collection._ As described above in "Data Use," QuinStreet primarily uses the data it collects to connect consumers with Advertising Partners who can provide information about the products and services those consumers are seeking.

_Categories of Third Parties with Whom QuinStreet Discloses Personal Data._ In addition to the sharing for the primary use described in "Data Sharing," we may share your data with other QuinStreet businesses, service providers, and third party websites.

_Categories of Data Sold._ As described above in "Data Use" and "Data Sharing," QuinStreet may transfer Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third Party Data to Advertising Partners who can provide the consumer with information about the products and services they are seeking. We may receive a fee for the transfer of that data or when the consumer purchases a product or service. 

_CCPA Rights._ The CCPA affords certain rights and protections to California residents including: (i) the right to request that we delete any "personal information" that we have collected from you (" **Right to Delete** "); (ii) the right to request that we disclose the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information collected and sold (" **Right to Know** "); and (iii) the right to direct us not to sell their "personal information" (" **Right to Opt-Out** "). " **Personal information** " is defined under the CCPA as "information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household."

California residents who would like to submit a Request to Know, Delete, or Opt-Out should follow the links below. You may also submit a Request to Know by calling our toll-free number (844)-872-7854. Upon submission, you will be asked to verify your email address. If we are able to verify your Request to Know or Delete, (e.g., that you are a California resident and that we have or have sold, as the case may be, your "personal information"), we will respond within 45 days of your submission (or such additional time period as the law allows us).
