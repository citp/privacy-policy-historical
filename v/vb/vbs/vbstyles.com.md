All passwords are stored on our server in encrypted form - even we can not tell what they are! If you lose your password, you request us to send a secret URL to your email address, using which you can reset your password. Your phone number will be used only for verifying the style purchase and won't be used for any other purpose.

We will never sell, rent or share your personal information with a 3rd party, especially your email addresses and phone numbers, without your express permission, unless required by law. Never ever! 

**We will only access your personal information when:**

  * You specifically request us to do so (e.g. you are having technical difficulties).
  * It is required by law.

**Public Forums**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online for example on forums, on profile, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.
