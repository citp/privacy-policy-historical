### Privacy Statement

The Human Rights Campaign and Human Rights Campaign Foundation (jointly HRC) do not collect personally identifiable information about individual users, except when such individuals provide information on a voluntary basis (e.g., the membership registration area.) HRC does not share, rent or sell personally identifiable information about individuals collected on the website to other individuals, corporations or organizations without the user’s express consent. 

HRC reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of various areas on the website and to use such collected information in any way. HRC’s website sets "cookies" to automatically track data and non-personal information about users. "Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate users’ ongoing access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage and behavior and collect aggregate data that will allow HRC to improve its website. 

HRC provides users the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from HRC at the point where personally identifiable information is collected such as the membership registration area. While HRC provides links to other websites, HRC is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these websites. HRC reserves the right to change this policy at any time, with or without notice. 

[This statement and the policies outline herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.]
