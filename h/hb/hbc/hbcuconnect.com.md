HBCUCONNECT.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. We only use your personal information to help us to improve our services to you, to provide you with products you have requested, to inform you about additional products or services that may be of interest to you, and to provide you with a member newsletter. 

**How is your information stored and protected?**  
We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our Web site. That's why you have to enter a unique Member Name (email address) and Password each time you want to access your HBCUCONNECT.com account. Your Password should never be shared with anyone.

**What information does HBCUCONNECT.com collect about you and how is it used?**  
HBCUCONNECT.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our Web site. Some personal information is gathered when you visit HBCUCONNECT.com, including your Internet address and the site from which you visited. If you choose to become an HBCUCONNECT.com member, during registration HBCUCONNECT.com asks for your name, e-mail address, phone number, school name, claim to fame, most memorable moment, current whereabouts. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to HBCUCONNECT.com and are able to take full advantage of HBCUCONNECT.com's many features.

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by HBCUCONNECT.com and/or our partners; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact HBCUCONNECT.com we may keep a record of that correspondence. HBCUCONNECT.com also asks members to complete surveys.

We use all of the personal information that we collect for research purposes to improve the HBCUCONNECT.com service. In addition, we summarize information about our member’s that is provided to advertisers and partners. Our partners and advertisers use this summary information to provide more relevant information and offers to our members who choose to receive such offers and information. From time to time, we make our member e-mail list available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. We do not sell data about our users or provide any personally identifiable information about any individual member without their consent. Wherever HBCUCONNECT.com collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
