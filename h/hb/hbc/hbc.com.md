You may refuse to provide or withdraw your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information at any time, unless legal reasons prevent you from doing so. However, if you refuse to provide or you withdraw your consent, we may be unable to provide you with certain goods and services. If you would like to withdraw your consent, please contact the Hudson’s Bay Privacy Office.

**Collection, use and disclosure of your personal information – for optional purposes**

Hudson’s Bay may wish to use the personal information you provide to communicate with you for the purpose of offering you other products and services or allowing select organizations to offer you other products and services.  These offers may be sent to you by mail, fax or electronically, including by email, text or sound messages, or by telephone by way of an Automatic Dialing Announcing Device at the telephone number you have provided to Hudson’s Bay.

The collection, use and disclosure of your personal information for such marketing purposes is entirely optional and not required as a condition of doing business with us. You may withdraw your consent at any time. Because of distribution schedules, you may continue to receive marketing communications for a short period of time while your request is processed. If you would like to withdraw your consent, please contact the Hudson’s Bay Privacy Office.

**Maintaining and safeguarding your personal information**

Hudson’s Bay has adopted security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, loss or theft.

Hudson’s Bay limits access to personal information in its possession to those Hudson’s Bay associates and sub-contractors who need to know such personal information to provide you with the goods and services for which the information was collected.

Hudson’s Bay keeps your personal information only for as long as necessary to accomplish the identified purpose(s), and then securely destroys such information.

**Accessing and accuracy of your personal information**

You may request access to your personal information and an account of organizations to which such information has been disclosed. Hudson’s Bay will respond within 30 days of receiving such request. If we are unable to provide you with the information requested within that time, we will advise you and will respond to your request within an additional 30 days. We will need to verify your identity before providing you with the personal information we hold about you.

There is no cost for such request unless you require copies of records. Hudson’s Bay will advise you of the cost, if any, prior to copying those records.

Hudson’s Bay may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information if the information cannot be separated from the records of others, cannot be disclosed for reasons of security or commercial confidentiality, or is protected by legal privilege. If we cannot provide you with access to your personal information, we will advise you of the reasons access is being denied, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.

You may request a correction to your personal information by writing to the Hudson’s Bay Privacy Office.

**Video surveillance**

We conduct video surveillance at our stores for security, fraud and loss prevention purposes and for incident reporting purposes. We use the images and information from such videos only as required for such purposes and for certain operational purposes, such as to measure traffic patterns in our stores **.** We may provide data from such video surveillance to law enforcement officials.
