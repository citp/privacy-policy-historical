By accessing our Site without activating the appropriate setting in your browser (as described above), you consent to HITACHI's reasonable use of cookies as described within [HITACHI's Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/en-us/company/legal.cookie-policy.html).

### THIRD PARTIES

HITACHI will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others.

Unless we have specifically informed you, obtained your consent, or are permitted or required to do so by the laws of the jurisdiction we operate in, we will only share the personal information you provide with business partners and third-party service providers who are acting on our behalf, and then only for the uses described in this Policy. Specifically, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the third party's own direct marketing purposes unless you have provided your affirmative consent for such a disclosure.

Similarly, we ask that you do not provide us with information about third parties without their permission. You represent that, when providing us information about third parties, you have obtained previous, express and informed consent of such parties to process their personal data.

### LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES

HITACHI does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. When you link to other websites, HITACHI's privacy practices and this Policy no longer apply and HITACHI assumes no responsibility for the information or other practices of a website that is accessible through HITACHI. We encourage you to review other website privacy policies before disclosing any personal information to them.

### YOUR CHOICES

HITACHI respects your right to make your own choices about how your personal information is handled.

You can also opt out by clicking "unsubscribe" in any marketing email communications we send you, or you may contact HITACHI at privacy@hitachivantara.com.

In addition, access to certain applications or services may involve particular uses, disclosure or transfer of the personal information being collected during registration for that application or service. If required under the laws of your country of residence, you will be notified of such intended uses, transfer or disclosure and asked to provide your consent. Failure to provide your consent where so requested may mean you will not be provided access to the applications or services for which your personal information cannot be lawfully processed.

### PRIVACY RIGHTS

HITACHI strives to ensure the accuracy of your personal information, as provided to HITACHI. We will also provide you with notifications as required by applicable law.

If you are a resident of the EEA or as permitted by the laws of your jurisdiction, you may also:

  * Request access to or a copy of your personal information.
  * Request to correct, update or rectify your personal information.
  * Request that HITACHI deletes or blocks your personal data. HITACHI is unable to delete information that we deem necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and/or enforce our agreements.
  * Object to or seek a restriction on the processing of your personal data
  * Refuse to consent or revoke your consent to processing. Revoking your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  * Raise a concern to us at privacy@hitachivantara.com or the applicable data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.



HITACHI will respond to your requests pursuant to applicable law and in accordance with [HITACHI's Data Subject Rights Policy](https://web.archive.org/en-us/company/legal.data-subject-request-policy.html).

Requests should be directed to [online DSAR form](https://web.archive.org/en-us/company/legal/data-subject-access-request.html) or privacy@hitachivantara.com.

### SECURITY

We have put in place technical and organisational procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from you and to reduce the risk of loss, unauthorized access, misuse and alteration. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we work very hard to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted over our Site.

### SALE OF BUSINESS ASSETS

In the unlikely event of a sale of HITACHI, a HITACHI business unit, or a HITACHI affiliate, personal information held by HITACHI may be made available to a buyer or prospective buyers in order for them to evaluate any such purchase or to operate any parts of HITACHI's business.

### MODIFICATIONS

Subject to the legal requirements of your jurisdiction of residence for notice and consent, HITACHI reserves the right to modify or amend this Policy at any time in order to adjust to applicable laws or regulations, or changes in HITACHI's practices or procedures. Where conflicts exist between the terms and conditions of this Policy and applicable national data protection laws, the latter will take precedence. This Policy is not intended to, and does not, provide rights beyond those that are prescribed by applicable national laws. The implementation date will be displayed at the bottom of this Policy.

### HITACHI CONTENT PLATFORM ANYWHERE ANDROID APPLICATION

Hitachi Content Platform (hereinafter, "HCP") Anywhere is deployed by enterprises to mobilize, manage, and protect data. The data on the HCP Anywhere mobile application is stored and managed by the particular enterprise that deployed the HCP Anywhere sever, not HITACHI. In these cases, any data subjects who wish to exercise their rights should direct their query to our customers who act as "Data Controllers".

When installed on a device, the HCP Anywhere mobile application has access to several permissions which allows it to enforce security policies on the device based on the enterprise's HCP Anywhere settings. Mainly, the application can enforce:

  * Password requirements, such as length and alphanumeric requirements
  * Maximum inactivity time
  * Storage area encryption



The HCP Anywhere mobile application enforces these policies using Device Administration. Although the HCP Anywhere mobile application can enforce certain policies on the device, it does not collect or process any personal information (e.g. Your device password).

Our Site, our products, and services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen. Please let us know if a person under the age of thirteen has provided HITACHI with personal information by contacting privacy@hitachivantara.com. In the event that we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will implement the necessary technical and organizational measure to erase said information.
