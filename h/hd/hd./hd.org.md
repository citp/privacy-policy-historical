# ExNet: Privacy

We believe in the importance of keeping your personal information private. We will never use your information for any use beyond that stated or the additional permissions that you give us.

## Cookies

Our sites use temporary cookies where necessary to maintain information (such as which language you have indicated that you prefer to use) during a single browsing session. Some of our advertisers may use other forms of cookies or similar (see "Advertisers" below).

## Server Logs and Statistics

Our servers, as with virtually all Web servers, will record your IP address when you visit. We may also record and/or display non-personal statistics such as current number of users and popular site items. We do not use such information for tracking the activities of specific users. We may use such information to avert misuse of resources such as bandwidth. 

## Advertisers

Our sites use third-party advertisers. We expect them to respect your personal data in a broadly similar way to the privacy policy described in this page.

Some advertisers may use behavioural tracking to help target their ads, but in this case there should be a reasonable opt-out available.

## Email, Forms and other Feedback

If you respond to us through any explicit feedback, for example by email, we will not use your data in any way not advertised with that feedback mechanism unless agreed with you.

## Changes

Our policies may change from time to time, for example as laws are changed. We will always attempt to protect your privacy, but you may wish to check this page or its successors from time to time to remain up-to-date with our policy.
