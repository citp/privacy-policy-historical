For example, you may be asked to provide information concerning your music or other entertainment preferences, purchasing habits, and the like. HDtracks may request this information in order to enhance your experience by understanding you better and to also make you aware of new services, programs or offers in which you may be interested.

We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and for federal export law compliance when required. This information is analyzed at an aggregate level and is not considered personally identifiable. We may also collect statistical data on all users of our Website, including: the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer, the referring URL, if any, and the browser software identification.

**Use of Cookies.** We may use data collection devices such as "cookies" (small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes) to assist us in providing our services. Cookies make using the Site easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you, helping identify you whenever you return to our Site, and reducing the number of times you are required to enter your password during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted toward your interests and preferences. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that). If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. Please note, that if you set your browser to block acceptance of cookies, this may affect your ability to use the HDtracks service or enter our Website.

### YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW WE USE IT

In general, HDtracks may use non-personally identifiable information about you to improve and enhance the services we provide. HDtracks may share this information with the suppliers of content on the service, affiliates and other entities in non-personal form to show general demographic and preference information among users of the HDtracks service or for other purposes. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include personal information (such as your email address). If you provide HDtracks with personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of Service, HDtracks will not disclose, share, sell or rent personally identifiable information collected on our Website to any third party without your prior consent, unless as part of the overall sale or a substantial portion of the assets of HDtracks and its operations. 

 **Third Parties in General.** We work with third parties who provide services, which may include website hosting, order processing, credit card clearance, data analysis, customer service, promotion fulfillment, and other services of an administrative nature. Personal information, including financial information, may be shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services to you. We seek to impose confidentiality obligations on such service providers. Also, entities into which our company is merged, or to which our assets, site or operations have been transferred or sold, will be able to use your personal information under the terms of this Privacy Policy. We also reserve the right to disclose personal information to third parties when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, to enforce our Terms of Service, to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of HDtracks, its content providers, or the public, to respond to an emergency, or as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.

### OUR SECURITY

We use reasonable security methods to protect the data that resides on our servers. However, because no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers. It is also possible that information you supply to us will be intercepted during transmission.

Whenever you give HDtracks sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers), HDtracks will take commercially reasonable steps to protect such information by establishing a secure connection with your Web browser. HDtracks employs an industry standard technology known as a secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect the transmission of payment information from the HDtracks Network to our servers. We do not share your credit card information with any parties not directly involved in processing or completing your purchase.

To help protect your HDtracks Account information, please keep your password secure. We suggest that you pick a non-obvious password that mixes numbers and letters. In addition, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any HDtracks Account information.

Remember to sign out of your HDtracks Account, and close your browser window whenever you leave your computer. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information, because your computer may be accessible to others or used in a shared setting. HDtracks's Privacy Policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond HDtracks's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.

### LINKS

HDtracks may allow certain invited entities to be included in a list of links found on the HDtracks.com site. However, any link to a page which displays a URL other than a domain name that contains HDtracks.com in the address window of your browser is a link to a site outside of our service and therefore outside the control of HDtracks. These other sites may send their own cookies to you, collect data or solicit personal information. HDtracks cannot guarantee and is not responsible for the content of outside sites. While HDtracks strives to protect our visitors' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security and privacy of any information you disclose at other sites, and you do so at your own risk.

###   
REGARDING PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE

The Website and the services provided thereon are intended for access and use strictly by adults 18 years and older. As such, it is not HDtracks's intention to collect nor maintain any personally identifiable information from persons under 18 years of age. Although HDtracks does not seek to collect any information from persons under the age of 18, should you find that your child has submitted his/her information, HDtracks will make reasonable efforts to delete a child's information from its database upon request. You may request to have such information purged from HDtracks's database by sending an email request to privacy@HDtracks.com. In the event that you are requesting such information to be purged from HDtracks's database, please make sure to include the correct email address that was submitted by the child.
