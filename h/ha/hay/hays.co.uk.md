\- Entering your details on the Hays website or via an application form, as part of the registration process;

\- Leaving a hard copy CV at a Hays recruitment event, job fair or office;

\- Emailing your CV to a Hays consultant or being interviewed by them;

\- Applying for jobs through a job aggregator, which then redirects you to the Hays website;

\- Entering your personal details into a Hays microsite; or

**Personal data that we receive directly from you**

  * We both share the same goal – to make sure that you have the best staff for your organisation. We will receive data directly from you in two ways:

\- Where we contact you, either by phone or email, or through our consultants' business development activities more generally.

    * We may periodically send you information that we think you may find interesting, or to ask for your help with connecting other Candidates with jobs. In particular, we may wish to use your data for the purposes listed below, where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements. Please note that this list is not exhaustive. To: 

\- enable us to develop and market other products and services;

\- market our full range of recruitment services (permanent, temporary, contract, outplacement, MSP programmes and RPO services) to you;

\- send you details of reports, promotions, offers, networking and client events, and general information about the industry sectors which we think might be of interest to you;

\- display promotional excerpts from your details on Hays' website(s) as a success story (only where we have obtained your express consent to do so); and

\- provide you with information about certain discounts and offers that you are eligible for by virtue of your relationship with Hays.

    * We need your consent for some aspects of these activities which are not covered by our legitimate interests (in particular, the collection of data via cookies, and the delivery of direct marketing to you through digital channels) and, depending on the situation, we'll ask for this via an opt-in or soft-opt-in (which we explain further below). Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click here.  
 
    * Soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies where you have previously engaged with us (for example by submitting a job application or CV, or registering a vacancy to be filled), and we are marketing other recruitment-related services. Under ‘soft opt-in’ consent, we will take your consent as given unless or until you opt out. For most people, this is beneficial as it allows us to provide you with information that we think will be of interest to you and suggest other jobs to you alongside the specific one you applied for, significantly increasing the likelihood of us finding you a new position. For other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent.  
 
    * If you want to know more about how we obtain consent, please click here. If you are not happy about our approach to marketing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and can find out more about how to do so here. Nobody's perfect, even though we try to be. We want to let you know that even if you have opted out from our marketing communications through our preference centre, it is possible that your details may be recaptured through public sources in an unconnected marketing campaign. We will try to make sure this doesn't happen, but if it does, we're sorry. We'd just ask that in those circumstances you opt out again.   
 
    * All our marketing is based on what we think will serve our Clients and Candidates best, but we know we won’t always get it right for everyone. We may use your data to show you Hays adverts and other content on other websites, for example Facebook. If you do not want us to use your data in this way, please turn off the “Advertising Cookies” option (please refer to our Cookies Policy). Even where you have turned off advertising cookies, it is still possible that you may see a Hays advert, but in this case it won’t have been targeted at you personally, but rather at an anonymous audience.   
 

**Equal opportunities monitoring and other sensitive personal data**

  * We are committed to ensuring that our recruitment processes are aligned with our approach to equal opportunities. Some of the data we may (in appropriate circumstances and in accordance with local law and requirements) collect about you comes under the umbrella of "diversity information". This could be information about your ethnic background, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or other similar beliefs, and/or social-economic background. Where appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements, we'll use this information on an anonymised basis to monitor our compliance with our equal opportunities policy. We may also disclose this (suitably anonymised where relevant) data to Clients where this is contractually required or the Client specifically requests such information to enable them to comply with their own employment processes.   
 
  * This diversity information is what is called ‘sensitive’ or 'special category' personal information and slightly stricter data protection rules apply to it. We therefore need to obtain your explicit consent before we can use it. We'll ask for your consent by offering you an opt-in. This means that you have to explicitly and clearly tell us that you agree to us collecting and using this information.  
 
  * We may collect other sensitive/special category personal data about you, such as health-related information, religious affiliation, or details of any criminal convictions if this is appropriate in accordance with local laws and is required for a role that you are interested in applying for. We will never do this without your explicit consent unless we have another valid legal basis to do so.   
 
  * If you would like to find out more about consent, please click here. Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, different rules apply to this sensitive/special category data. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click here.  
 
  * If you are not happy about this, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and you can find out how to do so here.   
 

**To help us to establish, exercise or defend legal claims**

  * In more unusual circumstances, we may use your personal data to help us to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.  
 

**Profiling**

  * Although at present all our recruitment activities involve human-decision making during the process, we may in the future use fully automated technologies such as expert systems or machine learning to complete a Candidate selection process from end-to-end, where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements.  
 
  * Where appropriate, we will seek your consent to carry out some or all of these activities. If you do not provide consent to profiling, your application will continue to be reviewed manually for opportunities you apply for, but your profile will not be automatically considered for alternative roles. This is likely to decrease the likelihood of us successfully finding you a new job.  
 
  * You have the right to withdraw that consent at any time and can find out more about how to do so here.

  * **PEOPLE WHOSE DATA WE RECEIVE FROM CANDIDATES AND STAFF, SUCH AS REFEREES AND EMERGENCY CONTACTS AND DEPENDENTS:** We will only use the information that our Candidate gives us about you for the following purposes: 

\- If our Candidates or Staff members put you down on our form as an emergency contact, we'll contact you in the case of an accident or emergency affecting them; or 

-If you were put down by a Staff member as a next of kin or dependant or any other kind of beneficiary, we will store your personal data to ensure the personnel records of that Staff member are correct, and use your personal data where necessary to provide employee benefits and pay remuneration and disclose your data to the relevant benefits provider.

\- If you were put down by our Candidate or a prospective member of Staff as a referee, we will contact you in order to take up a reference. This is an important part of our quality assurance process, and could be the difference between the individual getting a job or not.

\- If you were put down by our Candidate or a prospective member of Staff as a referee, we may sometimes use your details to contact you in relation to recruitment activities that we think may be of interest to you, in which case we will use your data for the same purposes for which we use the data of Clients.

******************************

### WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH?

  * Where appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements, we may share your personal data, in various ways and for various reasons, with the following categories of people: 

\- Any of our group companies;

\- Individuals and organisations who hold information related to your reference or application to work with us, such as current, past or prospective employers, educators and examining bodies and employment and recruitment agencies;

\- Tax, audit, or other authorities, when we believe in good faith that the law or other regulation requires us to share this data (for example, because of a request by a tax authority or in connection with any anticipated litigation);

\- Third party service providers who perform functions on our behalf (including external consultants, business associates and professional advisers such as lawyers, auditors and accountants, technical support functions and IT consultants carrying out testing and development work on our business technology systems);

\- Third party outsourced IT and document storage providers where we have an appropriate processing agreement (or similar protections) in place;

\- Marketing technology platforms and suppliers;

\- In the case of Candidates: potential employers and other recruitment agencies/organisations to increase your chances of finding employment;

\- In the case of Candidates: third party partners, job boards and job aggregators where we consider this will improve the chances of finding you the right job;

\- In the case of Candidates: MSP suppliers as part of our clients' MSP programmes;

\- In the case of Candidates and our Candidates' and prospective members of Staff's referees: third parties who we have retained to provide services such as reference, qualification and criminal convictions checks, to the extent that these checks are appropriate and in accordance with local laws;

\- If Hays merges with or is acquired by another business or company in the future, (or is in meaningful discussions about such a possibility) we may share your personal data with the (prospective) new owners of the business or company.

  
 



*******************************

### HOW DO WE SAFEGUARD YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

  * We are committed to taking all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access. We do this by having in place a range of appropriate technical and organisational measures. These include measures to deal with any suspected data breach.  
 
  * If you suspect any misuse or loss of or unauthorised access to your personal information please let us know immediately. Details of how to contact us can be found here.   
 



********************************

### HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR?

  * We will Delete your personal data from our systems if we have not had any meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you are working for or with) for two years (or for such longer period as we believe in good faith that the law or relevant regulators require us to preserve your data). After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.   
 
  * For those Candidates whose services are provided via a third party company or other entity, "meaningful contact" with you means meaningful contact with the company or entity which supplies your services. Where we are notified by such company or entity that it no longer has that relationship with you, we will retain your data for no longer than two years from that point or, if later, for the period of two years from the point we subsequently have meaningful contact directly with you.  
 
  * When we refer to "meaningful contact", we mean, for example, communication between us (either verbal or written), or where you are actively engaging with our online services. If you are a Candidate we will consider there to be meaningful contact with you if you submit your updated CV onto our website or take part in any of our online training. We will also consider it meaningful contact if you communicate with us about potential roles, either by verbal or written communication or click through from any of our marketing communications. Your receipt, opening or reading of an email or other digital message from us will not count as meaningful contact – this will only occur in cases where you click-through or reply directly.   
 



********************************

### HOW CAN YOU ACCESS, AMEND OR TAKE BACK THE PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO US?

  * One of the GDPR's main objectives is to protect and clarify the rights of EU citizens and individuals in the EU with regards to data privacy. This means that you retain various rights in respect of your data, even once you have given it to us. These are described in more detail below.  
 
  * To get in touch about these rights, please contact us. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled). Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.  
 
  * **Right to object:** this right enables you to object to us processing your personal data where we do so for one of the following four reasons: (i) our legitimate interests; (ii) to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority; (iii) to send you direct marketing materials; and (iv) for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.  
 
  * The "legitimate interests" and "direct marketing" categories above are the ones most likely to apply to our Website Users, Candidates, Clients and Suppliers. If your objection relates to us processing your personal data because we deem it necessary for your legitimate interests, we must act on your objection by ceasing the activity in question unless: 

\- we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which overrides your interests; or

\- we are processing your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.

  
 
  * If your objection relates to direct marketing, we must act on your objection by ceasing this activity.   
 
  * **Right to withdraw consent:** Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data for certain activities (for example, for our marketing arrangements or automatic profiling), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.  
 
  * **Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR):** You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or Delete such information. We may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless your request is "manifestly unfounded or excessive". If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost where legally permissible. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.   
 
    * Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject access requests and may refuse your request in accordance with such laws. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click here.  
 
    * **Right to erasure:** You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances. Normally, the information must meet one of the following criteria: 

\- the data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected and/or processed them;

\- where previously given, you have withdrawn your consent to us processing your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue processing;

\- the data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in a manner which does not comply with the GDPR);

\- it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller; or

\- if we process the data because we believe it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests, you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.

  
 
    * Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject right to erasure and may refuse your request in accordance with local laws. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click here.  
 
    * We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons:   
 

\- to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;

\- to comply with legal obligations or for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;

\- for public health reasons in the public interest;

\- for archival, research or statistical purposes; or

\- to exercise or defend a legal claim.

    * When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will Delete the relevant data.  
 
    * **Right to restrict processing:** You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This means that we can only continue to store your data and will not be able to carry out any further processing activities with it until either: (i) one of the circumstances listed below is resolved; (ii) you consent; or (iii) further processing is necessary for either the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another individual, or reasons of important EU or Member State public interest.   
 
    * The circumstances in which you are entitled to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data are: 

\- where you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we are processing about you. In this case, our processing of your personal data will be restricted for the period during which the accuracy of the data is verified;

\- where you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests. Here, you can request that the data be restricted while we verify our grounds for processing your personal data;

\- where our processing of your data is unlawful, but you would prefer us to restrict our processing of it rather than erasing it; and

\- where we have no further need to process your personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.

  
 
    * If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.  
 
    * **Right to rectification:** You also have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Where appropriate, we will also tell you which third parties we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.  
 
    * **Right of data portability:** If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer your Hays account details to another online platform. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format that is password-protected so that you can transfer the data to another online platform. Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you. This right of data portability applies to: (i) personal data that we process automatically (i.e. without any human intervention); (ii) personal data provided by you; and (iii) personal data that we process based on your consent or in order to fulfil a contract.
    * **Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:** You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Details of how to contact them can be found here.   
 
    * If you would like to exercise any of these rights, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your personal data), details of how to contact us can be found here. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.  
 
    * You may ask to unsubscribe from job alerts and any other marketing communications from us at any time. Details of how to do so can be found here.  
 
    * It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during the period for which we hold your data.

### WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA ON THE HAYS WEBSITE?

  * You can find out which Hays entity is responsible for processing your personal data and where it is located by following this link.   
 
  * If you have any comments or suggestions concerning this Privacy Policy please follow this link. We take privacy seriously so we'll get back to you as soon as possible.   
 



********************************

### HOW DO WE STORE AND TRANSFER YOUR DATA INTERNATIONALLY?

  * So you want to know more about how we store and transfer your data internationally? In order to provide you with the best service and to carry out the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, your data may be transferred:   
 

\- between and within Hays entities;

\- to third parties (such as advisers or other Suppliers to the Hays business);

\- to overseas Clients;

\- to Clients within your country who may, in turn, transfer your data internationally;

\- to a cloud-based storage provider; and

\- to other third parties, as referred to here.

  
 
  * We want to make sure that your data are stored and transferred in a way which is secure. We will therefore only transfer data outside of the European Economic Area or EEA (i.e. the Member States of the European Union, together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data, for example: 

\- by way of data transfer agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data by data controllers in the EEA to data controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws; or

\- by signing up to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for the transfer of personal data from entities in the EU to entities in the United States of America or any equivalent agreement in respect of other jurisdictions; or

\- transferring your data to a country where there has been a finding of adequacy by the European Commission in respect of that country's levels of data protection via its legislation; or

\- where it is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between ourselves and a third party and the transfer is in your interests for the purposes of that contract (for example, if we need to transfer data outside the EEA in order to meet our obligations under that contract if you are a Client of ours); or

\- where you have consented to the data transfer.

  
 
  * To ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate procedures with the third parties we share your personal data with to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the law on data protection.

### COOKIES POLICY

**What's a cookie?**

  * A "cookie" is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive and which records your navigation of a website so that, when you revisit that website, it can present tailored options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes.   
 
  * Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system. If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your browser settings. We also provide information about this in our Marketing preferences page on the Hays website.  
 

**How do we use cookies?**

  * We use cookies to do two things: 

\- to track your use of our website. This enables us to understand how you use the site and track any patterns that emerge individually or from larger groups. This helps us to develop and improve our website and services in response to what our visitors want and need; and

\- to help us advertise jobs to you that we think you'll be interested in. Hopefully this means less time for you trawling through endless pages and will get you into the employment you want more quickly.

  
 
  * Cookies are either: 

\- Session cookies: these are only stored on your computer during your web session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser – they usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page but they do not collect any information from your computer; or

\- Persistent cookies: a persistent cookie is stored as a file on your computer and it remains there when you close your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you visit that website again. We use persistent cookies for Google Analytics and for personalisation (see below).

  
 
  * Cookies can also be categorised as follows: 

\- Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are essential to enable you to use the website effectively, such as when applying for a job, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on our website cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.

\- Performance cookies: These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our website. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the site are most popular.

\- Functionality cookies: These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.

\- Personalisation cookies: These cookies help us to advertise details of potential job opportunities that we think may be of interest. These cookies are persistent (for as long as you are registered with us) and mean that when you log in or return to the website, you may see advertising for jobs that are similar to jobs that you have previously browsed.

### OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR DATA

### LEGITIMATE INTERESTS

  * Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR is the one that is relevant here – it says that we can process your data where it "is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by [us] or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights or freedoms of [you] which require protection of personal data."   
 
  * We don't think that any of the following activities prejudice individuals in any way – in fact, they help us to offer you a more tailored, efficient service, so everyone's a winner! However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. If you would like to know more about how to do so, please click here.  
 
  * Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a different legal basis for data processing might apply in certain cases. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click here.  
 
  * **CANDIDATE DATA:**  
 
  * We think it's reasonable to expect that if you are looking for employment or have posted your professional CV information on a job board or professional networking site, you are happy for us to collect and otherwise use your personal data to offer or provide our recruitment services to you, share that information with prospective employers and assess your skills against our bank of vacancies. Once it's looking like you may get the job, your prospective employer may also want to double check any information you've given us (such as the results from psychometric evaluations or skills tests) or to confirm your references, qualifications and criminal record, to the extent that this is appropriate and in accordance with local laws. We need to do these things so that we can function as a profit-making business, and to help you and other Candidates get the jobs you deserve.   
 
  * We want to provide you with tailored job recommendations and relevant articles to read to help you on your job hunt. We therefore think it's reasonable for us to process your data to make sure that we send you the most appropriate content.   
 
  * We also think that it might help with your job search if you take part in our specialist online training or some of our more interactive services, if you have the time. These are part of our service offering as a business, and help differentiate us in a competitive marketplace, so it is in our legitimate interests to use your data for this reason.   
 
  * We have to make sure our business runs smoothly, so that we can carry on providing services to Candidates like you. We therefore also need to use your data for our internal administrative activities, like payroll and invoicing where relevant.   
 
  * We have our own obligations under the law, which it is a legitimate interest of ours to insist on meeting! If we believe in good faith that it is necessary, we may therefore share your data in connection with crime detection, tax collection or actual or anticipated litigation.   
 



***

  * **CLIENT DATA:**  
 
  * To ensure that we provide you with the best service possible, we store your personal data and/or the personal data of individual contacts at your organisation as well as keeping records of our conversations, meetings, registered jobs and placements. From time to time, we may also ask you to undertake a customer satisfaction survey. We think this is reasonable – we deem these uses of your data to be necessary for our legitimate interests as an organisation providing various recruitment services to you.   
 



***

  * **SUPPLIER DATA:**  
 
  * We use and store the personal data of individuals within your organisation in order to facilitate the receipt of services from you as one of our Suppliers. We also hold your financial details, so that we can pay you for your services. We deem all such activities to be necessary within the range of our legitimate interests as a recipient of your services.   
 



***

  * PEOPLE WHOSE DATA WE RECEIVE FROM CANDIDATES AND STAFF, SUCH AS REFEREES AND EMERGENCY CONTACTS:  
 
  * If you have been put down by a Candidate or a prospective member of Staff as one of their referees, we use your personal data in order to contact you for a reference. This is a part of our quality assurance procedure and so we deem this to be necessary for our legitimate interests as an organisation offering recruitment services and employing people ourselves.   
 
  * If a Candidate or Staff member has given us your details as an emergency contact, we will use these details to contact you in the case of an accident or emergency. We are sure you will agree that this is a vital element of our people-orientated organisation, and so is necessary for our legitimate interests.   
 



****************************************

### CONSENT

  * In certain circumstances, we are required to obtain your consent to the processing of your personal data in relation to certain activities. Depending on exactly what we are doing with your information, this consent will be opt-in consent or soft opt-in consent.   
 
  * Article 4(11) of the GDPR states that (opt-in) consent is "any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her." In plain language, this means that: 

\- you have to give us your consent freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;

\- you have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;

\- you should have control over which processing activities you consent to and which you don’t. We provide these finer controls within our privacy preference centre; and

\- you need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – we're likely to provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.

We will keep records of the consents that you have given in this way.

  
 
  * We have already mentioned that, in some cases, we will be able to rely on soft opt-in consent. We are allowed to market products or services to you which are related to the recruitment services we provide to you as long as you do not actively opt-out from these communications.   
 
  * Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding consenting to receive marketing materials. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click here.  
 
  * As we have mentioned, you have the right to withdraw your consent to these activities. You can do so at any time, and details of how to do so can be found here.   
 



### ESTABLISHING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS

  * Sometimes it may be necessary for us to process personal data and, where appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements, sensitive personal data in connection with exercising or defending legal claims. Article 9(2)(f) of the GDPR allows this where the processing "is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity".  
 
  * This may arise for example where we need to take legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are required by law to preserve or disclose certain information as part of the legal process.  
 



### TO EXERCISE OUR RIGHTS OR CARRY OUT OUR EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY LAW OBLIGATIONS

  * For some Candidates, and for individuals whose personal data is provided by Candidates and Staff , it will sometimes be necessary for us to process your sensitive/special category personal data. Article 9(2)(b) of the GDPR allows us to do this where the processing is "necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising [our or your] specific rights… in the field of employment and social security and social protection law", as long as this is allowed by law. 
  * We process Candidates sensitive/special category personal data for the purpose of ensuring our compliance with our equal opportunities obligations where this is in accordance with local law, (for example, for some Candidates during the course of the recruitment process). We may also process the sensitive/special category personal data of individuals connected with Candidates or Staff for other reasons, for example to allow the relevant Staff member to access certain benefits or employment rights. You can find out how we process your sensitive/special category personal data under "What Kind of Personal Information Do We Collect?" above.

### GLOSSARY

  * _**Candidates**_ – includes applicants for all roles advertised or promoted by Hays, including permanent, part-time and temporary positions and freelance roles with Hays' Clients; as well as people who have supplied a speculative CV to Hays not in relation to a specific job. Individual contractors, freelance workers and employees of suppliers or other third parties put forward for roles with Hays, Clients as part of an MSP offering or otherwise will be treated as candidates for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   
 
  * _**Clients**_ \- while it speaks for itself, this category covers our customers, clients, and others to whom Hays provides services in the course of its business.  
 
  * **_Delete_ **–In this day and age it is virtually impossible to guarantee the permanent and irretrievable deletion of electronic data. In addition, as we have explained to you in this Privacy Policy, sometimes we may be obliged by law or regulation, or need for risk-management reasons, to retain the ability to access certain elements of personal data. However, our commitment to you is that once your personal data reaches the end of its nominal retention period, or where we receive a valid request from you to erase it, we will put in place specific operational and Systems measures to ensure that your data is "put beyond use". By this we mean that while the data will still technically exist on an archive system, we will ensure that it cannot be accessed by any of our operational Systems , processes or Staff. Only a very (and we mean exceptionally) small number of senior Staff , in very (and, again, we mean exceptionally) limited and carefully prescribed situations, will be able to restore your personal data so that it can be viewed for those legitimate purposes. Once we are clear that all relevant legally mandated retention periods have expired (which, for present purposes, we expect to be the period of ten years), we will go the additional final step of undertaking a "hard delete", whereby not even that very limited number of senior Staff would be able to restore your personal data.  
 
  * _**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**_ – a European Union statutory instrument which aims to harmonise European data protection laws. It has an effective date of 25 May 2018, and any references to it should be construed accordingly to include any national legislation implementing it.   
 
  * _**Managed Service Provider (MSP) programmes**_ – Clients' outsourcing of the management of external staff (including freelance workers, independent contractors and temporary employees) to an external recruitment provider.   
 
  * _**Other people whom Hays may contact**_ – these may include Candidates' and Hays' Staff emergency contacts and referees. We will only contact them in appropriate circumstances.  
 
  * _**Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) services**_ – full or partial outsourcing of the recruitment process for permanent employees to a recruitment provider.   
 
  * _**Staff**_ – includes current and former employees and interns engaged directly in the business of Hays (or who have accepted an offer to be engaged) as well as certain other workers who are or were engaged in the business of providing services to Hays (even though they are not classed as employees). For these purposes we also include employees of Hays who are engaged to work on Clients' premises under the terms of  RPO or MSP agreements. To be clear, 'Staff' does not include individuals hired by Hays for the purpose of being placed with Clients outside of an RPO/MSP arrangement. These individuals are treated in the same way as Hays' Candidates and are covered by this Privacy Policy. Likewise, independent contractors and consultants performing services for Hays fall within the definition of a 'Supplier' for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.  
 
  * _**Suppliers**_ – refers to partnerships and companies (including sole traders), and atypical workers such as independent contractors and freelance workers, who provide services to Hays. In certain circumstances Hays will sub-contract the services it provides to Clients to third party suppliers who perform services on Hays' behalf. In this context, suppliers that are individual contractors, freelance workers, or employees of suppliers will be treated as Candidates for data protection purposes. Please note that in this context, Hays requires Suppliers to communicate the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy (namely the sections directed at Candidates) to their employees.  
 
  * _**Systems**_ – include telephone, computer, internet and Wi-Fi systems, software and portals, accounts and/or networks belonging, controlled or used by Hays that are used to transmit, undertake and/or receive communications or are otherwise used in the course of Hays' business, including candidate portal software and CRM systems.  
 
  * _**Website Users**_ \- any individual who accesses any of the Hays websites.
