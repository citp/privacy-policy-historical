# Privacy Policy

Hay House has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information is a priority at Hay House, and we believe that a single, comprehensive privacy policy that is straightforward and clear is in the best interests of our customers and our businesses.

This Privacy Policy applies to personal and other information that may be collected when you interact with Hay House, Inc., which consists of websites owned, operated and managed by Hay House, including each website that links to this Privacy Policy. 

When you interact with our site, we collect two types of information Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII).

**Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is data about you that is personally identifiable.**

Our online e-newsletter asks users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the visitor when necessary about special promotions, and discounts, and is never divulged to third parties in a manner that personally identifies you. Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their e-mail address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and occasional future promotional material. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary regarding the order. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. We do not store credit card details nor do we share customer details with any 3rd parties in a manner that personally identifies the customer.  
If authorized by you, we may also access profile and other information from services like Facebook.

**Sharing with third parties  
** All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in confidence by Hay House. There are instances, however, in which personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below. 

With respect to personally identifiable information provided to Hay House, Hay House may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other related services. Vendors and service providers are contractually required to keep confidential the information received, and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they perform on our behalf. 

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
Please contact [Customer Service](http://www.hayhouse.com/contact/email/) to request the removal of your PII from our database or to no longer receive future communications.
