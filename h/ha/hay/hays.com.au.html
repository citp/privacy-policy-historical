<h1 class="lc">Hays Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Your privacy is important to Hays</h3>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. This statement outlines Hays policy on how we manage the
personal information we hold about our customers and others. It applies to all operations
within Hays Specialist Recruitment (Australia) Pty Limited in Australia and New Zealand,
including visitors to our website.</p>
<p>It is the policy of Hays to respect the confidentiality of information and the privacy of
individuals. Hays is bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act
1988 (as amended) in Australia; and by the Information Privacy Principles contained in the
Privacy Act 1993 in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Hays Privacy Policy will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and
technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains
appropriate to the changing environment. Any information we hold will be governed by the
most current version of the Hays Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private,
and is used only for the purpose you agree to. This document reflects our commitment to
you.</p>
<h3>The Hays Privacy Policy is based on openness</h3>
<p>We are committed to being open about how we use personal information.</p>
<p>Where our documents ask for personal information, we will generally state the purpose for its
use and to whom it may be disclosed.</p>
<h3>Type of personal information held by Hays</h3>
<p>Personal information that we collect and hold usually falls into the following categories:</p>
<ul>

other sources in connection with applications for work

illness or other causes

</li></ul>
<h3>General information collected from visitors to our website</h3>
<p>In general, we gather information about all our website users collectively, such as what
areas users visit more frequently and what services users access the most. We only use
such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is
most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall website
experience for you.</p>

<h3>Your personal information collected on the hays.com.au and hays.net.nz websites</h3>
<p>In some instances we may need specific information about you, such as name, address,
email address, telephone number, etc. We will collect this information if you apply for a job
or sign up for a service via our website, for example. We may also ask you for other
information such as the types of jobs you are interested in and your workplace concerns in
order to provide you with the best possible service and internet experience.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Placement operations</b> – to assist you in finding a suitable position

Privacy Act 1988. It is information or opinion about you, including membership of a
professional or trade association or membership of a trade union; criminal record; health or
disability, etc.</p>
<p>As outlined in the Australian Privacy Act, sensitive information, can, in most cases, only be
disclosed with your consent.</p>
<h3>Disclosures</h3>
<p>We may disclose your personal information for the purposes for which it is primarily held or
for a related secondary purpose and in some cases we may only disclose information with
your consent.</p>
<p>We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the Hays’ website, or personal
information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number
etc, to any outside parties, except when we believe we are under a lawful duty of care to do
so.</p>
<p>If the position you are applying for is in a country other than Australia or New Zealand, by
submitting your application to us, you are agreeing to your personal details being forwarded
to our offices, and possibly to employers, in that country.</p>

<h3>Management of personal information</h3>
<p>At Hays, we train our staff to respect the confidentiality of customer information and the
privacy of individuals. Hays regards breaches of your privacy very seriously and any breach
will result in disciplinary action being taken, dependent upon severity.</p>
<p>Hays has appointed a Privacy Officer to ensure that our management of personal
information is in accordance with this statement and the relevant Privacy Acts.</p>
<h3>How do we store personal information?</h3>
<p>Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us
personally, by phone, mail, over the internet or other electronic medium. We hold personal
information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and
other records, and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss,
unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>
<p>We may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. However, when we
consider information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or
we will securely destroy the records.</p>
<h3>How do we keep personal information accurate and up to date?</h3>
<p>Hays endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate and up to date.
We realise that information changes frequently with changes of address and other personal
circumstances. We generally update your customer information over the telephone. Please
advise your consultant when your personal details change.</p>

<p>Subject to some exceptions that are set out in both the Australian National Privacy Principles
and the New Zealand information Privacy Principles you can gain access to the personal
information that we hold about you.</p>

application form verifying your identity and specifying what information you require. Please
contact our Privacy Officer for an application form.</p>
<p>We will impose a moderate charge in providing access. Our Privacy Officer will discuss this
with you.</p>

as there may be a need to retrieve information from storage and review information in order
to determine what information may be provided.</p>
