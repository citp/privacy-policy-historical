            <strong>How We Disclose Information </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            We provide aggregate information to third parties that does not contain personally
            identifiable information. We may share your information, including your personally

            information that you provide us, but may not share it with third parties. We may
            also disclose your information with your consent.
            <br>
            <br>
            In our sole discretion, we may also disclose any information about you that we deem
            necessary to third parties, including your personally identifiable information,
            so we may:
            <br>
            <br>
            Comply with any law, regulation, court order, legal process, subpoena, or government
            request;
            <br>
            Investigate or prevent any potentially fraudulent or illegal activity;

            Confirm the authenticity of any purchase transaction or authorization of any credit
            card payment transaction;
