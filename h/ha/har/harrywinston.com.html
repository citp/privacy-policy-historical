            <br>
            We provide aggregate information to third parties that does not contain personally

            <br>
            In our sole discretion, we may also disclose any information about you that we deem
            necessary to third parties, including your personally identifiable information,
            so we may:
            <br>
            <br>
            Comply with any law, regulation, court order, legal process, subpoena, or government

            card payment transaction;
