**When do we share information about you?**

We may share within the Harris family of companies the information we collect about you. However, you as an individual, have a right to instruct us not to share among our banks and affiliated financial service companies certain information (other than information about our

These companies may include:   


  * Non-financial companies that perform services for us such as printing your check orders, data processing, and companies that perform marketing services on our behalf.

**Cookies**

It's important to us that your experience with a Harris Web site is effective and satisfying. To accomplish this, we use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browsers. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our Web Page Server so it can be read back later from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember specific information, such as pass codes and log in identification. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or collect personally identifiable information to determine who you are, or capture your e-mail address. The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them almost everywhere on the Internet.

One of the most beneficial uses of cookies is site personalization, where you are able to customize the information you see. For example, by using cookies as part of our internet banking, you can personalize your site. Each time you access your internet banking homepage, the browser will remember your preferences until the cookie expires. Harris also uses cookies to identify what sections of our site are visited most often so we can provide more information on the topics and subjects that our customers are interested in. 

You may determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by your system by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, since some of our applications use cookies to manage your session, disabling a cookie may cause some banking functions to not work properly.

**Children's Online Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect, use, or maintain any information through our websites about children who are under the age of 13. If we determine that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with information through one of our websites, we will only use this information to notify the parents that this information was received.
