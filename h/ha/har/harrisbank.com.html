      <p>The Harris Web site safeguards customer information by maintaining physical, 
        electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards 
        to guard non-public personal information about you. If you'd like to know

		We use your contact information (mailing address, e-mail address and phone numbers) you provide to us to inform you about important information relating to your account, including important administrative information. You have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving non-administrative information such as information about new products, services or offerings that we believe may be of interest to you.  If you                     do not want to receive this information by mail, e-mail or telephone in the future, you can tell us not to contact you by contacting us at 1-888-340-2265 or writing to us at Harris Privacy Office, 111 West Monroe, 111/21W, Chicago, Illinois, 60610.  Please note that it may take several weeks to fully process your request. Thereafter, the only information we will provide you regarding our services will be through regular communications with you.
        
      </p><p><b>Please Note:</b> You can visit our site without providing us with 
        any personal information about yourself to find out about our history, 
        our products and services, and career opportunities we have available.</p>
        <p><b>What information do we collect about you?</b></p>
        
      <p>Harris collects the following types of non-public personal information 
        about you from the following sources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <span class="txt-black">Information you provide to us when you fill 
          out an application, complete a form, or make a request for services. 
          This includes your name, address, Social Security Number, assets and 
          income.</span></li>
        <li><span class="txt-black">Information from your transactions with us, 
          such as your account balance, account usage, and loan history.</span></li>
        <li><span class="txt-black">Information obtained from others, such as 
          credit reporting agencies</span><span class="txt-black">.</span></li>
      </ul>
        <p>This information allows us to:</p>
        
      <ul>
        <li><span class="txt-black">Respond more accurately and efficiently to 
          your requests.</span></li>
        <li><span class="txt-black">Identify opportunities to give you more convenience 
          and control by developing<br>
          new services that may benefit you<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span class="txt-black">Secure your accounts and help protect you, 
          and Harris, from fraud.</span></li>
      </ul>
        <p><b>How do we know the information we maintain about you is accurate?</b></p>
        
      <p>Harris has established procedures so that our information about you is 
        accurate, current and complete. If you ever discover inaccuracies in our 
        data, or if your personal information changes, we urge you to notify us 
        immediately by calling us at 1-888-340-2265, so that we can make the necessary 
        changes. 
      </p><p></p>
        <p><br>
          <b>How do we keep information about you safe?</b></p>
        
      <p> We limit access to the information we have about you to those employees 
        who need to know to provide you with a full range of services to help 
        you meet your financial needs. We also maintain physical, electronic, 
        and procedural safeguards that comply with federal laws and regulations 
        to guard your information. 
      </p><p><b>When do we share information about you?</b></p>
        
      <p>We may share within the Harris family of companies the information we 
        collect about you. However, you as an individual, have a right to instruct 
        us not to share among our banks and affiliated financial service companies 
        certain information (other than information about our<br>
        transactions or experiences with you) from your account applications or 
        information we receive from third parties. Please see our Privacy Policy 
        (<a href="privacy_full.html" class="content">Click Here</a>) for more 
        information. </p>
        
      <p>In addition, we may share information about you with companies outside 
        Harris to complete a transaction you have requested, to help service your 
        account, to provide us operational support, and with other financial institutions 
        with which we have a joint marketing agreement. These companies are not 
        permitted to use your information for anything beyond the intended service 
        and agree to strict standards regarding security and confidentiality. 
      </p>
        <p>These companies may include: <br>
        </p>
        
      <ul>
        <li><span class="txt-black">Non-financial companies that perform services for us such as printing your check orders, data processing, and companies that perform marketing services on our behalf.<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span class="txt-black">Financial service providers, including other banks, insurance companies or mortgage companies. For example, we have an arrangement with another financial institution to offer you Harris Bank credit cards. </span><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>We may also share information when required by law or authorized by you. 
        Examples include responding to a subpoena, conducting a fraud investigation, or reporting to a credit bureau.</p>
        <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
        
      <p>It's important to us that your experience with a Harris Web site is effective 
        and satisfying. To accomplish this, we use "cookies" as part of our interaction 
        with your browsers. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our Web Page Server so it 
        can be read back later from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember specific 
        information, such as pass codes and log in identification. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or collect personally identifiable information to determine who you are, or capture your e-mail address. The use of cookies is an 
        industry standard - you'll find them almost everywhere on the Internet.</p>
        
      <p>One of the most beneficial uses of cookies is site personalization, where 
        you are able to customize the information you see. For example, by using 
        cookies as part of our internet banking, you can personalize your site. 
        Each time you access your internet banking homepage, the browser will 
        remember your preferences until the cookie expires. Harris also uses cookies 
        to identify what sections of our site are visited most often so we can 
        provide more information on the topics and subjects that our customers 
        are interested in. </p>
        
      <p>You may determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by your system 
        by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, since 
        some of our applications use cookies to manage your session, disabling 
        a cookie may cause some banking functions to not work properly.</p>
      <p><b>Children's Online Privacy</b></p>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect, use, or maintain any information through 
        our websites about children who are under the age of 13. If we determine 
        that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with information through 
        one of our websites, we will only use this information to notify the parents 
        that this information was received. </p>

      <p>Harris will not share account information with non-affiliated third parties 
        without your authorization, except to furnish you the Harris Total Look

        with Harris affiliates unless you instruct us not to share certain information. 
        Refer to the <a href="privacy_full.html" class="content">Harris Privacy Policy</a> for 
        more information, including how you can limit the sharing of certain information 
        with our Harris affiliates. </p>
      <p>Harris will use the account information to furnish and support the Harris 
        Total Look service, and may use such data to allow Harris to offer you 
        relevant products and services, relationship management services, or other 
        financial planning tools. </p>
      <p>Harris may use aggregated, non-personal statistical data derived from 
        your use of the Harris Total Look service for analysis purposes in order 
        to improve Harris' services or products. Yodlee, the provider of this 
        service, may only use your account information and Harris account information

      <p>Yodlee may use aggregated, non-personal statistical data derived from
