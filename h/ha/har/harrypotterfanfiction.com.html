  <p align="left">It is our policy that personal information given to us , such 
    as your name and e-mail address, is private and confidential. As such, the 
    personal information you provide is accessible only by designated staff, and 
    is used only for the purposes for which you provided the information, such 
    as to register or as a point of contact. Please note that any email sent through 
    the archive software may be periodically checked for abuse. While this information 
    will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent the webmaster, 
    administrator and moderators cannot be held responsible for any hacking attempt 
    that may lead to the data being compromised or corrupted.</p>
  <p align="left">We will not release personal information to third parties. Except

  <p align="left">Our computer is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal 
    information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, 
    but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service 
    Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information 
    about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors 
    to our site. This information is used only for internal purposes by our staff.</p>
  <p align="left">In addition, our website tracks information about the visits 
    to our web site. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number 
    of visitors to our site, the daily requests we receive for particular files 
    on our web site, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated 
    statistics are used to guage the popularity of the site, but again, the statistics 
    contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
