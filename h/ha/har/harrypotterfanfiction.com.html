  <p align="left">It is our policy that personal information given to us , such
    as your name and e-mail address, is private and confidential. As such, the
    personal information you provide is accessible only by designated staff,
    and is used only for the purposes for which you provided the information,
    such as to register or as a point of contact. While this information
    will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent, the site owner,
    administrator and moderators cannot be held responsible for any hacking attempt
    that may lead to the data being compromised or corrupted. Please note that
    any email sent through the archive software may be periodically checked for
    abuse.</p>
  <p align="left">We will not release personal information to third parties. Except 
    if release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental 
    investigations or proceedings. There are no other circumstances under which 
    we will provide or sell personal information to third parties.</p>
  <p align="left">Our network is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal
     information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors,
     but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service
     Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information
     about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors
     to our site. This information is used only for internal purposes by our
    staff.</p>
  <p align="left">In addition, our website tracks information about the visits 
    to our web site. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number 
    of visitors to our site, the daily requests we receive for particular files 
    on our web site, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated 
    statistics are used to guage the popularity of the site, but again, the statistics 
    contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
