        <div class="head-gray">I. Scope</div>
        <div class="text">This Policy applies to our website, www.Harri.com, which is owned by Harri. It is Harri's policy to comply with data protection legislation, which regulates the processing and disclosure of information relating to individuals' personal data. As set forth more fully below in the section on Information Collection &amp; Use, it is Harri's policy to collect and store personal information only if knowingly submitted by users through www.Harri.com, and data collected by Harri is used only to operate our business and deliver and improve upon the services we provide to our users. <br> <br> Our website contains links to other websites over which we have no control. You acknowledge that Harri bears no responsibility whatsoever for the content or data collection and usage practices of other websites to which you link from our website. We encourage you to independently review the privacy policies of those other websites so that you know how they may collect, use, and share your information. <br> <br> You acknowledge that Harri likewise has no control over and bears no responsibility for the data usage of employers or any other individuals who may access, store, or transfer your information on this site, or of third party advertising networks or other third parties with whom Harri may work to serve you personalized advertisements. We strive to provide a safe, secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users of our services, and we have implemented reasonable technical and strategic measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and modification of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons or entities will never be able to defeat those measures or use your information for improper purposes. Moreover, you should be aware that any profile you create on our website may be monitored by your current employer. For all of these reasons, we encourage you not to post sensitive information or other information you would not want made public to our site.</div>
        <div style="height: 25px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="head-gray">II. Information Collection &amp; Use</div>
        <div class="text">Harri collects different categories of information from its users, depending upon which of our services you use. Each user of Harri's website, by virtue of visiting www.Harri.com, is subject to the collection by Harri of certain aggregate, non-personal data such as demographic information and basic information about the user's Internet connections and site browsing patterns. Visitors are not, however, required to provide any personal information that could be used to identify them unless and until they attempt to connect with a candidate (for employers browsing the site) or view a job description and/or connect with an employer (for candidates browsing the site). In each case, it is indicated on the website whether and what personal data must be provided to use the desired functionality. It is Harri's policy to collect and store personal information only if knowingly submitted by users.</div>
        <div style="height: 25px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="text">User information accessed by Harri and its agents will be used for the purpose of operating our website and delivering or improving upon the services we offer to job candidates and employers, potentially including the display of personalized content and advertising relating to users' hospitality and retail experience and preferences, either on our site or other sites with which we have a business relationship. We disclose personal information to third parties in limited circumstances, as set forth below, in the section on Information Disclosure.</div>
        <div style="height: 25px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="text">We may personalize the advertising that you are shown on our website or other websites with which we have a business relationship. In order to provide this personalization, in addition to information we collect about you on our sites, we may acquire information (including both personal and aggregate data) about you from third parties who provide it to us.</div>

Similarly, you may be able to send information about our services to your personal contacts (e.g., through "Share with a Friend," "Share with a Colleague," and other sharing tools), in which case you may be required to provide us with your contact's personally identifiable information. By so doing, you confirm that you give Harri consent, on behalf of your personal contact, to receive an e-mail from Harri about the relevant service.</div>

We may also aggregate on an anonymous basis data regarding job qualifications, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search or competition among candidates for any such position. Such aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or fellow candidates or members of the public.</div>
                <div style="height: 25px;">&nbsp;</div>
                <div class="text">Harri may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in limited circumstances. By registering with Harri, creating and managing your profile, or opting to provide personally identifiable information when one or more of our services permit or require the sharing of such information, you thereby consent to Harri disclosing your personally identifiable information to third parties, subject to local law, in the following ways:
                    <div class="text">We may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you create a profile, we will publish on our site the information and images that you have posted to that profile, which will be visible to any visitor of Harri's site. For more details regarding Harri's use of information you post in public areas of our site, see the section on Use of Personally Identifiable Information.</div>
                    <div style="height: 25px;">&nbsp;</div>
                    <div class="text">We may release personally identifiable information to companies and individuals we engage to perform functions on our behalf and to help us to operate our site and business and deliver our services to you. For example, we disclose personally identifiable information to third parties including, but not limited to, website developers, attorneys, accountants, clerical staff, website or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and financial institutions (for the limited purpose of processing credit card transactions). These companies and individuals will only have access to your personal information to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf, and only under reasonable disclosure restrictions.</div>
                    <div style="height: 25px;">&nbsp;</div>
                    <div class="text">We may disclose personally identifiable information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a government entity, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process, protect the rights or property of Harri, prevent a crime, or protect the personal safety of our users or the public. Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information when a visitor is in violation of our Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or engages in (or is reasonably suspected of engaging in) any harmful, infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law, as well as in response to allegations of infringement. Harri also reserves the right to suspend or terminate your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity.</div>
                    <div style="height: 25px;">&nbsp;</div>
                    <div class="text">We may disclose and transfer personally identifiable information to a third party who acquires any or all of Harri's assets, whether by way of acquisition, merger, consolidation, or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Harri becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Harri or its liquidator, administrator, receiver or administrative receiver may sell, license, or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the court. You will be notified of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party by e-mail or through a notice posted prominently on our website.</div>

However, you can open a new, separate account at any time or reactivate your previous account by following instructions we will give to you at the time you close your account. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. We will also retain logs, demographic, and statistical information that may relate to you but do not identify your personally.

You also will be given the opportunity, in any promotional email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. <br> Note that, because Harri will occasionally need to send you certain messages in connection with your use of our site such as important service and security announcements, system status updates, account activity notifications and confirmations, and other service-related communications), you will not be able to opt out of receiving these types of communications unless you close your account with Harri altogether.</div>

                        <div style="height: 25px;">&nbsp;</div>
                        <div class="text">Specifically, when a user clicks on a profile that you have made private, the user will be able to view only your restricted profile, which includes your first name, last initial, and has a bar blocking your photo. We will hide all other information, including your contact information. If, after viewing your restricted profile, the user would like to view your full profile and initiate a connection with you, the user must request permission to do so by clicking on the connect button. Harri will then send you an email/message notifying you of the user's request. You will have the option to either deny or grant the user access to your full profile.</div>
