We respect the privacy of every individual who visits this site. This Privacy Policy explains how www.HardRock.com (“Website”) collects and otherwise processes personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). 

You may choose to submit Personal Information (such as your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number) to us at several different points on our website. We collect and use Personal Information for business purposes only. We will not share this information in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Website, please contact us at [customer_care@HardRock.com](mailto:customer_care@HardRock.com). 

Who is collecting your information  
The Website is owned and operated by Hard Rock Cafe International (USA), Inc. (“Hard Rock”). This Policy applies only to [www.hardrock.com](http://www.hardrock.com/). Hard Rock is the sole owner of the information collected on the Website. All websites operated by Hard Rock will adhere to this Policy.

FRANCHISEE WEBSITES   
Many Hard Rock establishments are owned and operated by franchisees, who are independent businesspersons. Some franchisees also operate websites. Many, but not necessarily all, franchisee sites follow this privacy policy. Therefore, please review each site’s privacy policy. 

LINKS   
This Hard Rock Website contains links to other sites whose privacy policies may differ from those of Hard Rock. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites even if you access them using links from our Website. 

WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT  
Information on www.hardrock.com is gathered in two ways: (1) indirectly, i.e., certain anonymous information about all visitors, such as domain name, browser type and page views, which is collected through our site's technology and is not linked to individual identities (see “Cookies” below); and (2) directly, when you voluntarily submit Personal Information such as, first and last names, addresses and email addresses, on various pages of www.hardrock.com. When we collect this type of information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for information and how this information will be used. 

COOKIES   
Some information that we collect about subscribers is collected passively through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small files of information, which save and retrieve information about your visit to HardRock.com - for example, how you entered and navigated our site, and what information was of interest to you. The cookies we use do not contain personally identifiable information. 

SUBSCRIBERS/ORDERS   
In order to use portions of this website, a user must first complete a registration form. If you wish to subscribe to any of the Hard Rock services or register for any of our Website programs, such as ‘All Access’ or ‘Pin Collectors Club’ (“Services”), we will need to collect certain Personal Information about you, such as your name, email address and contact details, and, if applicable, credit card payment information. This information is used to contact the user about the specific services on our site or in our stores for which they have expressed interest. For some Website services, you will be asked to provide a password and user identification. This information is collected to confirm eligibility for use of the online services and to establish the identity of the authorized user. 

We also request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact details and financial information, such as credit card payment information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

SURVEYS & CONTESTS   
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Website and other Hard Rock services. 

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION AND WHO WE SHARE IT WITH   
During the course of business, we may disclose Personal Information to third-party service providers who have been legally contracted to help us with these tasks, and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. We may also need to disclose Personal Information where required by law, court order, or in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. 

CHOICE/OPT-OUT   
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their Personal Information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product or register for a service from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.

HARD ROCK –3RD PARTY DISCLOSURE POLICY   
We may, under limited circumstances, send you offers for related products or services from affiliated Hard Rock companies or jointly offered by Hard Rock together with select third parties. These offers are sent only to those users who have not ‘opted-out’ of receiving marketing materials from Hard Rock. 

CONSENT TO SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION   
As a global organization, data we collect may be transferred internationally throughout Hard Rock’s worldwide organization. Some of these foreign jurisdictions may not provide the same level of privacy protection as your local jurisdiction. By purchasing Services and submitting Personal Information through the Website, you consent to such transfers of your Personal Information. Without such consent, Hard Rock is not able to provide you with access to its online services. 

PUBLIC FORUMS  
This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information you disclose in a public forum will be available to other visitors to our Website. To the extent you disclose your information to other parties, their use of the information will not be subject to this Privacy Policy. 

CONDOMINIUM SUBMISSIONS   
We request information from those users that are interested in receiving information about the Hard Rock Hotel Condominium Residences. Because these Residences are not owned, developed or sold by us or any of our affiliates, but rather by a third party developer, if you submit information to us for this purpose, we will collect the information, provide a copy of the information to the developer (so that they can contact you and follow up on your request) and retain a copy of the information for our records and use. This information shall be owned jointly by the third-party developer and us. Notwithstanding anything in this policy to the contrary, we will not monitor the developer’s use of this information and in no event will we be responsible for the developer’s use of the information, which may or may not be used consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you want to opt out of further uses of your information by developer or update your information, you will need to contact the developer directly. If you do not want the information shared with the developer consistent with these conditions, do not submit your information for this purpose.

PROTECTING CHILDREN:  
Hard Rock Cafe takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13. Our websites are general audience sites.

HOW WE ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR DATA  
When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. 

We have also implemented additional technology, as well as policies and procedures to safeguard your privacy from unauthorized access or use and will continue to update these measures as new technology becomes available. 

HOW TO CONTACT US

ENFORCEMENT  
This website is compliant with the U.S. Commerce Department Safe Harbor provisions. In order to demonstrate that our privacy policy accords with the above privacy instrument, we are voluntarily committed to a Self Assessment procedure. If you feel that Hard Rock has not complied with the policies outlined in this privacy policy please contact us at [customer_care@hardrock.com](mailto:customer_care@hardrock.com), attention: Privacy Compliance.
