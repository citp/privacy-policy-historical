We may partner with another party to provide specific services for us, such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional or other support services. We will provide contact or other information necessary for the third party to provide these services for us. These parties are generally not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

### Your Choices

**Remove Your Name From Our Lists At Any Time**

If you prefer not to receive catalogs or other communications from Harry & David or one of our brands via U.S. mail or telephone, please email Customer Service or contact us at the address shown above. 

Because customer communications are often prepared well in advance of deployment (sometimes several months before the communication is made), you may continue to receive some communications after you send us a request not to use your information. We appreciate your patience during this time. 

If you no longer wish to receive email communications from us regarding our Websites, partner offers, special offers or services, products, and/or newsletters, you may choose to stop receiving these emails at any time. Information on how to opt out of receiving marketing email is provided in every email, or you may email Customer Service, or you may write us at the address provided above. Please be sure to include your full name, email address, and specifically what type of information you do not want to receive. If you opt out of receiving marketing email, we will continue to send you emails regarding order confirmation and shipment notification when you place an order with us. 

Please Note: If you are a member of the Harry & David Preferred Customer Program and you opt out of receiving communications via email, this may reduce or eliminate the offers and other promotional benefits you receive as a Preferred Customer. 

**Your California Rights**

Harry & David and our brands may disclose your personal information to third parties for their use in marketing to you unless you tell us not to. In order to opt out of such sharing or for further information, please write to us at Harry & David, PO Box 712, Medford, OR 97501. Please be sure to include your full name, address, email address and specifically what type of information you do not want to receive. Please allow up to 6 to 8 weeks to process your request from the date of receipt. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive that contains information about your computer. Cookies may be used to enable us to track and target your interests for the purpose of enhancing your experience on our Websites. Some cookies are deleted once you leave our Website (“Session cookies”) while other cookies remain after your leave our Website (“Persistent cookies”) so that you are recognized when you return to the Website. We may use persistent cookies to enable us to provide services to you, including, “Remember Me,” order history, address book, My Gift History, etc. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your browsing activity, please email Customer Service.

If you reject certain cookies, you may still browse our Website; however, you may not be able to purchase or have access to all of our services. 

We currently do not employ technology that responds to “do-not-track” signals from your browser. We may use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this Website. These companies may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our site and use such information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services. This information is collected through the use of pixel tags or cookies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you can visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/>.

You can direct us to remove your name from our lists by following the instructions in Your Choices above. 

For your security you will be asked to provide certain information to identify yourself before we will accept changes to your information. To help us more effectively respond to any request by you with regard to use of your customer information, we ask that you contact us personally (e.g. via your email address as listed in our customer records or via a letter signed by you) rather than utilizing a third party to do so. If we receive a request from a third party regarding, or requesting a change in, use of your customer information, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to not grant the request from such third party (unless required to do so by law) and/or to require that you personally confirm the third party request. 

### Sweepstakes

From time to time we may offer promotions, contests or sweepstakes on our Website. If you choose to participate we may collect information including your name, address, age, telephone number, email address or other contact information. We may also request other information some of which may be optional. Participation is subject to the Official Rules governing that promotion. The information may be used to conduct the promotion and for other business purposes which may include marketing and may be shared with our affiliates, vendors, or third parties in accordance with this privacy policy and the Official Rules.

### Security
