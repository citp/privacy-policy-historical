For example, unless HardRockHotel.com can remember the dates you used in your hotel search, we will not be able to check room availability. Cookies also enable us to customize our Web site and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience on our Website. In addition, cookies are used to:<br><br>
Measure usage of various pages on our Web site to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access; and<br><br>

        Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino and its third-party service providers use pixel tags.  Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the Web site and consist of a few lines of computer coding delivered with the Web page.  Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino.  Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino and our email service provider use pixel tags to:<br>
        <br>
1) Track customer response to Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino advertisements and Web site content;<br><br>
2) Determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages.  Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a "coded sensor" in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf.  The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.  This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.  The sensor does not collect or use any other information.  If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor;<br><br>
3) Know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us; and<br><br>
4) Allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and site usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you.</td>
