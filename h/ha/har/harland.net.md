  * Authentication- Users require a unique user account and password. Our policy states user accounts must not be shared and requires complex password construction.
  * Encryption - All data input during a user's session is encrypted during transmission. Sessions are logged out after 15 minutes of inactivity.
  * Vulnerability Testing - We maintain current patches and anti-virus definitions, and an independent security firm regularly performs vulnerability tests on our perimeter and enterprise infrastructure.
  * Monitoring - We monitor for security events with Intrusion Detection and respond with our Security Threat Response Team (START).
  * Annual Auditing - Our audit plan includes an annual review of our control measures, penetration testing, and an annual certification of our perimeter and enterprise to ensure Harland Clarke is meeting or exceeding essential security best practices.
