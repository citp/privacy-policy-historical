# Welcome to the John H. Harland Website

This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use and protect information about you, our valued customer.

“We” or “us” means the companies and businesses that belong to the John H. Harland Company corporate family and includes, for example, John H. Harland Company; The Check Store, Inc.; Scantron Corporation and Harland Financial Solutions, Inc.

We may change this Privacy Notice at any time so that it accurately states how we collect, use and protect information about you.

In order to better serve your needs and provide you with better customer service, we collect nonpublic personal information about you in many different ways. For example, we collect:

  * Information you give to us when you contact us or communicate with us in any way. For example, when you order or reorder products or services from us, when you fill out our forms or applications, or when you otherwise contact us to order or to learn more about our products and services. Such information may include, for example, your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.
  * Information that we obtain from your transactions and dealings with us. For example, your account, order and payment history.
  * Information that we obtain from third parties about your transactions and dealings with these third parties. For example, your account, order and payment history with these third parties.
  * Also, we may collect Information about you that we obtain from consumer reporting agencies, such as your credit worthiness and credit history.



We consolidate and share all of the information we collect, as described above, including information about former customers, with the companies and businesses that belong to the John H. Harland Company corporate family.

We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to

  * persons or companies that perform business services and operations for us (such as check printing) or function on our behalf, or
  * persons or companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing arrangements.



Except as described above, we do not disclose any nonpublic personal information we collect about you, whether you are our current or former customer, to anyone, except as permitted or required by law (such as to protect against fraud or in response to a subpoena).

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who we believe need to know that information to provide products or services to you.

Whenever we hire persons or companies outside of our corporate family to provide business or marketing support services to us, we will only provide them with such nonpublic personal information about you that we believe is necessary to fulfill their responsibilities or to provide a service to you.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard you nonpublic personal information.

As mentioned above, we may revise this Privacy Notice at any time by posting an updated Privacy Notice on our website at [www.harland.net](http://www.harland.net/) or sending you a revised Privacy Notice by mail or through other means of communication. Please consult the Privacy Notice posted on our website regularly.
