If we refuse your request or any element of it, we will provide you with our reasons for doing so. 

**(b)   Right of Correction:** If personal information we hold about you is not accurate, or is out of date or incomplete, and requires amendment or correction you have a right to have the data rectified, updated or completed.

### Our Use of Cookies

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

A cookie is a small piece of text that is placed within the memory of a computer and can be later retrieved by web page servers. We use cookies to enhance your interaction and convenience with our website and do not use cookies to record any personal information. 

Cookies may record information about your visit, including the type of browser and operating system you use, the previous site you visited, your server’s IP address, the pages you access and the information downloaded by you. While this anonymous statistical data may be aggregated and used in broader statistical analysis by us and our web monitoring service provider to improve our services, at no time can we personally identify you as the source of that data. 

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue you with a cookie when you log on to our website and you are deemed to have consented to the use of the cookie. The purpose for which the cookie is used is for identification of a specific user during a session on our website e.g. when a user is logged on to the website to identify what permissions they have and what items are in their shopping cart. The cookie will be deleted at the end of the website session. 

### Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

Where we engage third party service providers to perform services for us those third parties may be required to handle your personal information. Under these circumstances those third parties must safeguard this information and must only use it for the purposes for which it was supplied.

Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless disclosure is either necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorised or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity or any breach of any of the [Website Terms of Use](https://www.harveynorman.ie/corporate-information/website-terms-of-use.html) of our website or our [Online Sale Terms](https://www.harveynorman.ie/corporate-information/online-sale-terms.html).

### Legal basis for Processing your Personal Information 

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

Under GDPR, the main grounds that we rely upon in order to process your personal information are the following:

**(c)  ** Necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests: either we, or a third party, will need to process your personal information for the purposes of our (or a third party’s) legitimate interests, provided we have established that those interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms, including your right to have your Personal Information protected. Our legitimate interests include responding to requests and enquiries from you or a third party, fulfilling sales, optimising our website and customer experience, informing you about our products and services and ensuring that our operations are conducted in an appropriate and efficient manner.

### Providing Personal Information About Another Person

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

You represent to us that where you provide personal information to us about another person, you are authorised to provide that information to us, and that you will inform that person who we are, how we use and disclose their information, and that they can gain access to that information. You agree that you will inform that other person of this Privacy and Cookies Policy and that they may review and download a copy on our website [www.harveynorman.ie](https://www.harveynorman.ie/)

### Securing Your Personal Information

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security procedures in order to protect personal information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. Access to your personal information is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their responsibilities. 

We and our third party service providers take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your personal information where it is no longer required and to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, disclosure, loss, misuse and alteration. 

### Accuracy of Data 

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To assist us in doing this, please provide us with the correct information and inform us if your details change. You may update your membership details at any time by accessing your membership account or by contacting our [Customer Services Team](https://www.harveynorman.ie/customer-services/contact-us.html). If we deny you access to your personal information, we will provide you with the reason for such denial. 

### Accuracy of Data 

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

We will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the purpose or purposes for which we have collected it. The criteria that we use to determine retention periods will be determined by the nature of the data and the purposes for which it is kept. For example, if we receive your information through a competition entry, we will retain your data for as long as is necessary to administer the competition. In certain circumstances, once we have deleted or anonymised your data, we may need to retain parts of it (for example, your email address), in order to comply with our obligations under GDPR or other legislation, or for fraud detection purposes. 

### Linked Sites

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites. 

### Transmission of Your Data

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

While care is taken to protect your personal information received from you via our website, unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed as 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us or receive from us online. This is particularly true for information you send to us via email as we have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your personal information, we are required to protect it in accordance with the GDPR and all other applicable legislation. 

### Where we Store Your Personal Data

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), and in particular to our hosting company, Yoogalu Pty Ltd and its related bodies corporate, which is located in Australia. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy and Cookies Policy. 

### Changes to Our Policy

[back to top  ↑](https://www.harveynorman.ie/#back-to-top)

From time to time it may be necessary for us to review and revise this Privacy and Cookies Policy. We reserve the right to change our Privacy and Cookies Policy at any time. Amendments or replacements of the Privacy and Cookies Policy will be posted on our website and where we have your email address we will advise you of material changes to our Privacy Policy.
