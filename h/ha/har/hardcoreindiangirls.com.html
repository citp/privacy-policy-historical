 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our 
 firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our 
 practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of 
 personal and non-personal information provided by visitors to our 
 Web site. By using this site, you signify your assent to these our 
 privacy practices and the terms and conditions of our Web site.

 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not use this 
 site.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial"><span class="blueText"><b><font size="2">WHAT TYPE INFORMATION IS 
 COLLECTED?</font></b></span><font size="2"><br><br>Personal Information:<br><br>We only 
 collect personal information from visitors to our Web site when they 
 voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration form or 
 electing to use one of our services. We may require visitors to 
 provide us with information including, but not limited to, their 
 name, physical address, email address, birth date, credit card 
 number, credit card expiration date, username, password, and on 
 occasion a unique identifier (such as their mother’s maiden name). 
 </font></font> 
 </p>
 <p><font face="Arial"><span class="blueText"><b><font size="2">Non-Personal 
 Information</font></b></span><font size="2"><br><br>When visitors access our Web site, 
 certain non-personal information may be collected from them 
 including, but not limited to, their browser type (e.g., Netscape or 
 Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), 
 IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed the site 
 (e.g., lycos.com). In addition, we may collect information about 
 visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit 
 the Web site, the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit, 
 the amount of time spent viewing the site, the number of times the 
 visitor returns to the site, and click-stream data. We use 
 transparent tracking pixels to determine the number of Web site 
 visitors that have been sent to us through our affiliate network. We 
 do not track any information about visitors once they leave our 
 site. We may use cookies (small text files that are stored on 
 visitors computers when they access our Web site) to collect this 
 information. Information collected through cookies may be combined 
 with visitors' personal information. We may also allow unaffiliated 
 third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of 
 our Web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in 
 doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our Web 
 site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains 
 how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have 
 the browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to 
 erase cookies from their hard drives. </font></font> </p>
 <p><font face="Arial"><span class="blueText"><b><font size="2">IN WHAT WAY DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL AND 
 NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</font></b></span><font size="2"><br><br>Our goal in collecting 
 personal information is to provide visitors with the most 
 personalized Web experience possible and our advertisers with an 
 efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little 
 about our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and 
 advertisements, and provide better services. We may use information 
 collected from visitors to our Web site for any of the following 
 purposes: (1) to send visitors information and promotional materials 
 about our company, (2) to send visitors information and promotional 
 materials from our marketing partners and third parties (such as 
 advertisers on our Web site), (3) to deliver targeted display 
 advertisements and offers by email (by matching criteria provided by 
 our advertisers with information collected from our visitors), (4) 
 to contact visitors to our Web site when necessary, (5) to allow 
 one-click purchases or access to proprietary content by 
 pre-populating fields, within registration or other transaction 
 screens, with a visitor's name, billing address, and credit or 
 charge card information (among other things), as provided by that 
 visitor, (6) to help diagnose problems with our server, (7) to 
 administer our Web site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our site 
 (e.g., to determine the number of visitors to the site), (9) to help 
 us better understand visitors' use of our site, and (10) to protect 
 the security or integrity of our site. Non-personal information will 
 be used for purposes of conducting internal reviews of the site, 
 monitoring the site, and providing a greater online experience for 
 our visitors. </font></font> </p>
 <p><font face="Arial"><span class="blueText"><b><font size="2">DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR 
 INFORMATION?</font></b></span><font size="2"><br><br>We may transfer or disclose 
 information collected from visitors to our Web site to our employees 
 and independent contractors, to our parent company, subsidiaries and 
 affiliates, and to our consultants, other business associates, and 
 suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that party to perform a 
 business, professional, or technical support function for us, or if 
 required to do so by law. We may also disclose information we 
 collect from our site visitors to our marketing and business 
 partners, who may use the information in connection with their 
 business operations, such as to send marketing and other 
 communications to visitors of our site. <br>We may also share, rent, 
 sell, or transfer any personal information (including financial 
 information) provided by our visitors to third parties. During the 
 registration process, and at certain times during any member user 
 session, we may present additional offers from third party service 
 providers. Our third party service providers have their own terms 
 and conditions and privacy policies. We suggest that visitors access 
 these third party sites and review their terms and conditions and 
 privacy policies before "subscribing" to any third party offer. If a 
 visitor subscribes to a third party offer during our registration 
 process, we will transfer the financial data they provided to us as 
 part of the registration process to that third party company, which 
 will then process the transaction using that financial data. We may 
 also share non-personal information we collect from visitors to our 
 site, such as their browsing behaviors, with third parties. For 
 example, we may tell a third party advertiser that a certain number 
 of people have visited a certain area on our Web site. </font>

 <p><font face="Arial"><span class="blueText"><b><font size="2">WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE TO 
 PROTECT YOUR DATA?</font></b></span><font size="2"><br><br>To help prevent unauthorized 
 access, maintain data integrity, and ensure the appropriate use of 
 information, we have put in place certain physical, electronic, and 
 managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we 
 collect from visitors to our Web site. We use SSL (Secure Socket 
 Layer) technology to protect any credit card information you provide 
 us. We allow access to personal information only to persons and 
 entities engaging in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. 
 Visitors should consider any communication that they transmit to us 
 (such as data, questions or answers, comments, suggestions, or 
 communications submitted to a chat room) to be non-confidential. We 
 will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to a 
 visitor is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient. </font>

 PRIVACY</font></b></span><font size="2"><br><br>Protecting the privacy of children is VERY 
 important to us. For that reason we do not structure any part of our 
 site to attract anyone under the age of 18 (21 in some areas) and we 
 do not allow anyone under the age of 18 (21 in some areas) to 
 register and become a member of our site. </font></font> </p>

 or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any of our 
 assets may be transferred to a third party, including personal 
 information collected from visitors to our Web site. </font></font> </p>
