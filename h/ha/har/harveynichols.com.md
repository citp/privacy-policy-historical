# Privacy Policy

We take your privacy very seriously and treat all your personal information as confidential. This policy relates to your use of this website; the data you supply to us (including data gathered in our stores) and our use of that data.

### Collection, use and storage of data

### What sort of data do you collect?

## Personal information

When you shop on this website, you will be asked to input personal information such as your name, email address, billing address, delivery address, telephone number(s), product selections and a password. Basic personal details, including your name and email address, are also requested when you sign up to receive our email newsletter.

We may ask you for your date of birth (optional), which will be used to identify you if you wish to make changes to your account or your order by telephone.

We do not store credit or debit card information.

## Your use of our website

We collect, and our third party providers may collect, information about where you have come from on the internet and how you are accessing the site (for example, the URL you came from before you visited this website and your IP address), your browser type, your geographical location, the pages of our website you viewed during your visit, the advertisements you clicked on, and any search terms that you entered. We may collect this information about all visitors, even those who do not register with us. For more information, see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/information/policies/cookie-policy/).

### How do you use this data?

  * To process your orders, from delivery to payment and returns. 
  * To send you marketing communications, where you have requested them. 
  * For analytical purposes, to learn about how shoppers are using our website. This helps us improve and personalise the site and its services to you. 
  * To prevent or detect fraud and abuses of our website.



### How do you keep my personal information and payment details secure?

All information about our customers and site visitors is kept on a secure server and we fully comply with all applicable UK data protection and consumer legislation. Any personal information that you give us (or that is available on public registers), and any information we use to identify you, is held in accordance with our registration with the Information Commissioner's Office.

### SSL and encryption technology

We have implemented internet security technology to ensure that it is safe for you to shop with us. We use internet standard encryption technology to scramble your personal data when you give it to us. This process is known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and we are constantly updating our technology to provide you with the maximum level of security.

To check you are in a secure area of our website, you can look at the bottom right of your browser window and you will see a closed padlock or an unbroken key. This indicates that SSL is enabled and your transaction is secure.

Additionally, we do not hold any of your credit card details anywhere on our website. They are simply passed securely to our e-payments processor for authorisation by your bank.

### MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa   
(3D Secure)

MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa are services that let you shop online with added confidence and security, and protect you from fraud.

To use MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa, all you need to do is register your card once, and create a password. Then, when you make a purchase online, a MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa window will appear. Simply enter the characters requested from your password and click on the 'Submit query' button. Your identity is verified and the purchase is secure.

If you are registered for the scheme and have a password already, you will be asked to enter characters from your password after you have entered your card details and clicked on the ‘Continue to payment’ button. Your card provider will then verify the characters you have entered and, if they match its records, approve your transaction.

If your card provider is registered for the scheme but you personally are not, we will offer you the chance to sign up and create a password during the checkout process. This is all handled through MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa itself. We simply pass your encrypted details on to your card provider securely.

If you would like further information, please contact your MasterCard or Visa issuer.

### What you can do to stay secure

There are things you can do to protect your personal information and transactions when shopping online. Here are a few of them: 

  * When using a public computer, always log out and close the browser when you have finished.
  * Do not share your password with anybody else or write it down anywhere.
  * When you create a password, use at least eight characters and a combination of letters and numbers. Do not use any personal information in your password that can be easily obtained (such as your name). We also recommend that you change your password often.



Use different passwords for your different online accounts.
