  Hardhat101 allows other companies,  called Webmasters, third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve  advertisements within the Hardhat101 Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad  networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements  and links that appear on the Hardhat101 Sites. They automatically receive your  IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as  cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their  advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. <br>
  Hardhat101 does not provide any  personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad  networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or  feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However,  please note that if an advertiser asks Hardhat101 to show an advertisement to a  certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for  example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you  respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that  you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. You should  consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad  networks. Hardhat101's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control  the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. <br>
  <a name="Our_Commitment_To_Data_Security:" id="Our_Commitment_To_Data_Security:"></a><strong>Our  Commitment To Data Security: </strong><br>
  Hardhat101 uses commercially  reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the  integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure  or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Hardhat101 and you do  so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Hardhat101  makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.  However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not  be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,  technical, or managerial safeguards. <br>
  If Hardhat101 learns of a security  systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you  can take appropriate protective steps. Hardhat101 may post a notice on the Hardhat101  Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a  legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a  free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from  receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using this contact form. <br>
  <a name="Our_Commitment_To_Children.27s_Privacy:" id="Our_Commitment_To_Children.27s_Privacy:"></a><strong>Our  Commitment To Children's Privacy: </strong><br>
  Protecting the privacy of young  children is extremely important. For that reason, Hardhat101 does not knowingly  collect or maintain personally identifiable information or  non-personally-identifiable information on the Hardhat101 Sites from persons  under 18 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under  18. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Hardhat101  Sites at any time or in any manner. If Hardhat101 learns that personally  identifiable information of persons under 18 years of age has been collected on  the Hardhat101 Sites without verified parental consent, then Hardhat101 will take  the appropriate steps to delete this information and possibly terminate the  account(s) associated with the information. </p>
