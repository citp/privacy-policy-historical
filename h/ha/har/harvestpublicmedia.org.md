If you visit another Web site prior to browsing Harvestpublicmedia.org, that web site might place personally identifiable information within a URL, which may be logged by us. Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the internet. Depending on how you connect to the internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change each time you access the internet. Note that logging your IP address does not in and of itself provide us with your name, e-mail address or home or work address. We use this log information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and may also use it to gather general demographic information about you such as your general location and your Internet Service Provider.

**Use of cookies**

Most standard Web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," which allow a Web site to place information about a user's visit to that Web site in a small data text file that is stored on the user's computer. Our use of cookie technology will likely be transparent to you and is used to recognize you and hold information from one visit to the next in an effort to increase your ease of use of Harvestpublicmedia.org and to allow us to better understand how people use Harvestpublicmedia.org through click-stream analysis.

You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser preference options.
