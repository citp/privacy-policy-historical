### OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

We may gather and store aggregate information about visitors. The collection of this aggregate information enables us to measure the number of visitors to various portions of the Site, diagnose problems with our server, administer the Site and track visitor activity. We will use this aggregate information to learn more about what you and our customers are expecting from our services, and tailor and improve the Site. Because aggregate information collected on the Site does not personally identify you, we may use aggregate information for any purpose, and share aggregate information with third parties for any purpose. Below are ways we may collect this aggregate information:

  * HTTP cookies, flash cookies, or other similar technologies.
  * Pixel tags, also known as web beacons or clear GIFs or similar means. The data collected includes such anonymous information as what operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our Site, how long you stay on our web pages, and when you open emails from us.
  * Internet Protocol address, which is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting Internet Protocol addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.



We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) to gather and store aggregate information about visitors. Please use the following link to understand how Google Analytics collects and processes data: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners). Google Analytics uses cookies (see the link for how) to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (which may include your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google.

We also use service providers to help us develop applications for your convenience, such as to submit a claim through your mobile device. These application service providers may use tracking pixels, agents or other visitor identification technology to collect certain non-personal information, such as your browser type, your operating system, and other information that does not identify you. The application service providers do not receive your claims information or any other information that identifies you. These application service providers may collect unique device IDs including from mobile devices, mobile phone numbers, precise geo-location data, or call logs.

We and the third parties we partner with currently do not process or comply with any web browser's "do not track" signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit our websites or use our services. Some of our third party service providers may collect personal information on users of our Site over time and across different websites when users are visiting our Site.

### OUR SECURITY PROCEDURES

We take reasonable precautions to safeguard the personal information transmitted between visitors and the Site and the personal information stored on our servers, and we require third parties with whom we share personal information to use reasonable precautions to safeguard such information. Unfortunately, no method of transmitting or storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us through, or in connection with, the Site. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at The Hartford - Privacy Law, One Hartford Plaza, Hartford, CT 06155 or alternatively to CorporatePrivacyOffice@thehartford.com. In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email.

Security tip: If you receive an email or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or social security number) via email or to a website that does not seem to be affiliated with the Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information. Report such requests to us at The Hartford - Privacy Law, One Hartford Plaza, Hartford, CT 06155, or alternatively to CorporatePrivacyOffice@thehartford.com.
