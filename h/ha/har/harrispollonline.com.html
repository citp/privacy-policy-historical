<p>2) Information Collected on Harris Interactive Websites</p>
</b><blockquote><b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Information Collected During the Registration Process</p>
</b>
<p>Individuals can join our growing database of survey respondents by
registering at our HarrisPollOnline.com or HarrisZone.com websites, and via
links to the HarrisPollOnline.com registration pages from our main corporate
website <a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/" target="_blank">www.HarrisInteractive.com</a>,
European and Japanese web sites,<a href="file:///C:/TEMP/FrontPageTempDir/www.hieurope.com">
</a><a href="http://www.hieurope.com/">www.HIEurope.com</a>, <a href="http://www.aaa.co.jp/adams">www.aaa.co.jp/adams</a>,
and <a href="http://www.hpol.co.jp/">www.hpol.co.jp</a>, or when registering on
the websites of third parties with whom we have developed business
relationships. Registration through these various means work as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During the registration process on HarrisPollOnline.com (a site directed
    towards, intended for, and appealing to adults) we require individuals to
    provide us with contact information (e.g., name and email address) and
    demographic information (e.g., gender, birth date, city, state, zip code,
    and country). To allow individuals to modify their submissions at a later
    point in time, we also ask registrants to establish a username and password.
    This means that if an individual under the age of 13 attempts to register,
    their registration information will be collected, but automatically deleted.</li>
  <li>During the registration process on HarrisZone.com we require individuals
    to provide us with the same contact information as on the
    HarrisPollOnline.com website. We also request that individuals provide their
    parent’s email address. This enables us to contact the parent if parental
    permission is required for a particular study due to its subject nature or
    software download requirements. Children under age 13 are not permitted to
    register on HarrisZone.com, and are blocked from registering via a session
    cookie. Adults are directed to HarrisPollOnline.com.</li>
  <li>Our European and Japanese web sites (<a href="http://www.hieurope.com/">www.HIEurope.com</a>,
    <a href="http://www.aaa.co.jp/adams">www.aaa.co.jp/adams</a>, and <a href="http://www.hpol.co.jp/">www.hpol.co.jp</a>)
    link to the HarrisPollOnline.com registration process indicated above. These
    sites are focused on European and Japanese individuals, respectively.</li>
  <li>Potential survey site members age 13 or over may also have been recruited
    on our behalf by third party websites, who forwarded to us your information,
    with your consent. Any additional information we collect from you, for
    example, to complete registration (if it was not already completed by the
    third party) or during a survey is subject to this privacy policy.</li>
  <li>Individuals have the opportunity, in certain cases, to register in their
    native language by selecting from a set of available languages on the main
    registration page.</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Other Information Collected on Harris Interactive Websites</p>
</b>
<p>As part of the survey process, we often ask members other demographic
information (e.g., income level), and other information related to interests,
hobbies, and product/technology usage. We collect this information so that we
can send surveys to members that correspond with their interests, and aggregate
the responses received by various broad categories to report the aggregated
results to our clients. We also summarize information about the panel to develop
statistics ensuring that the panel is representative of the general population.
Finally, we use this information to pre-qualify panel members for future market
research reports that target certain demographics (male vs. female, age, etc.).</p>
<p>Harris Interactive offers an incentive program, HIpoints<sup>SM</sup>, where
members of its survey sites can accumulate points towards award redemption based
on the number of eligible surveys in which they participate. This program is
open only to members in limited countries. To redeem HIpoints, members must
provide full name and shipping information so that we can deliver the selected
items.</p>
<p>Visitors to certain of our websites are provided email forms to contact us if
they have questions, comments, are interested in job opportunities, or require
further information on our products or services. Responses to such inquiries may
be sent via email or regular mail.</p>
<b>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Information Collected Passively on Harris Interactive
Websites</b></p>
<p>Like other websites on the Internet, we use a variety of mechanisms to keep
our sites running smoothly and ensure that your experience is a pleasant one. We
use cookies, small data files stored on your computer’s hard drive, to collect
information such as browser, type of computer, operating system, Internet
service provider, access times and other similar information. We also use
cookies to retain your username and password. This feature allows us to
recognize our members every time they return to the sites. Although, for your
protection you are still required to log in each time you visit in order to
access password-protected areas of our sites, such as the "Member
Services" area, which contains the personally identifiable information you
have provided to us. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.
You do not need to have cookies turned on to participate in our surveys, or to
visit our websites. Harris Interactive also permits certain third party
suppliers to set clear GIFs on the Harris Poll registrations obtained through
such third parties’ websites to enable them to measure the effectiveness of
their panelist recruiting campaigns.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>3) How Information Is Used</p>
</b><blockquote><b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Surveys</p>
</b>
<p>We will use the information you provide us primarily to contact you about
surveys in which we would like you to participate, or to provide you with the
results of the surveys. We may also notify you about new features on our
websites, or other products or services related to the primary purpose of our
business in which we think you may be interested. From time to time we may also
invite our members to enter a sweepstakes or participate in other incentive
programs, most of which are related to the running of our surveys. Any
additional information you provide when participating in an online sweepstakes
or other online incentive program we host is subject to this privacy policy. We
are not in the business of sending "spam" or unsolicited emails.</p>
<p>As part of our survey research process, we gather, aggregate, and analyze
information from our panelists. We provide the results of our research (which
contain no personally identifiable information) to our clients, which include
governmental agencies, major corporations, and other organizations. Your survey
responses are valuable in guiding the development and designing of products and
services. Panel members’ survey responses are often used by our clients to
make decisions on key issues.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Sharing Information</p>
</b>
<p>Harris Interactive is not in the business of selling your personally
identifiable information. We use the information you provide to us for internal
purposes, and share it only for the limited purposes described here:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>In order to provide you with the services on our sites, we may need to
      share your information with third parties, our agents, who perform
      services on our behalf, such as merchandise (HIpoints rewards)
      fulfillment, web hosting, and the like. They may also collect information
      on our behalf. For example, the HIpoints program is managed by our agent,
      Incentive Logic. A limited amount of your registration information is
      provided to Incentive Logic for purposes of running the HIpoints program.
      This information is kept in confidence and not used for any other purpose
      than to establish and track your earned HIpoints. Incentive Logic operates
      the HIpoints program in accordance with our privacy guidelines and does
      not share your personal information with any third party without your
      permission.</li>
    <li>In the case of our international medical professional panel, which is
      joint development effort of Harris Interactive and IMS Health Inc., the
      resulting database of respondents is available for use by both Harris
      Interactive and IMS Health Inc. for survey purposes. Harris Interactive’s
      use of personal information you provide as part of the international
      medical professional panel is subject to the same provisions as indicated
      herein for Harris Poll Online<sup>SM</sup> registrants.</li>
    <li>As a company that makes money on market research, protecting survey
      participants’ privacy has been an important part of our business long
      before the advent of the Internet. We know that you will not want to
      complete a survey if your personally identifiable information is shared
      with third parties, which is why we participated in industry-wide efforts
      to protect consumer information, even before we began conducting surveys
      online. We only release summarized or non-personally identifiable
      information to our clients and require your consent prior to releasing any
      personally identifiable information that you provide during the survey
      process. Clients that receive personally identifiable information are
      required to sign and abide by CASRO’s "Standards Regarding
      Disclosure of Respondent-Identifiable Data to Clients."</li>
    <li>Harris Interactive is a thriving and expanding business, and like other
      companies, we sometimes acquire or spin off new business units. As part of
      such transfers, we convey the business assets of the particular business
      unit, including survey participant data.</li>
    <li><b>Legal Disclaimer: </b>Though we make every effort to preserve user
      privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law
      wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to
      comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process
      served on our website.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Passively Collected Information</p>
  </b>
  <p>We passively collect information to make your browsing experience more
  pleasant, and to understand what areas of our sites are more popular, what
  areas may require improvement, and what technologies are being used by members
  of our sites. This information helps us to update and improve our sites. We
  also use this information for security purposes, to detect and to block
  security breaches, and to provide you with a safe online environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>4) Accessing the Information You Provided</p>
</b><blockquote><b>
</b>
<p>Not only is it important for our members to be able to correct their
information, it is important to us. The results from our public surveys (which
report aggregate, non-identifiable information) often get reported by the media.
We encourage members to keep their account profiles up-to-date, so that we
continue to have accurate demographic information behind our results. We wouldn’t
want to count a member’s vote in the California election if that member has
since moved to Rhode Island!!!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Harris Poll Online<sup>SM</sup> site gives users the
following options for changing and modifying information previously provided:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visit the <a href="http://www.harrispollonline.com/">HarrisPollOnline</a>
    website, log in, and update your information.</li>
  <li>Send postal mail to Rose Walker at our Survey Help Desk;</li>

  or leave a message and contact information on our voicemail, 1-800-600-2493.
  We will work to respond to your request within 12 hours of receipt.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>5) Your Options on Harris Interactive Websites</p>
</b><blockquote><b>
</b>
<p>We are committed to giving you the maximum amount of flexibility in accessing
your information, and in the level of participation you have with our sites. In
each email invitation sent to members of our respondent database, we provide the
opportunity to opt out of receipt of further mailings. This opt-out opportunity
deactivates the member's account and terminates their membership with Harris
Interactive. Our survey invitations inform you about the subject matter of the
survey in which we would like your input, whether it is in the category of
public opinion, current trends and activities, or products and services. If you
are willing to participate in the survey, great! If not, that’s OK too. Any
personally identifiable information that you provide during the survey process
will be subject to your consent prior to release to our client. Should you grant
release of such information, and then change your mind, all you need do is to
send an email to <a href="mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com">surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com</a>.</p>
<p>If at any point you decide that you no longer wish to be a member of the
Harris Interactive respondent database, you may send an email request with the
word "unsubscribe" to <a href="mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com">surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com</a>.
Panel members can also opt out by filling out a request on the Member Services
section of the website. We will retain your information in our
"unsubscribe" database, to ensure that we do not contact you in the
future.</p>
<p>Parents, you may unsubscribe your children who are registered members of
HarrisZone.com by sending an email to <a href="mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com">surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com</a>
with the first name of the child you would like to unsubscribe, and the website
in which they are a member. The message must come from the email account
provided as the "parent’s email account."</p>
<p>Parents, if we invite your 13-to-17 year old children to participate in
surveys addressing sensitive topics on our HarrisZone.com site, we may notify
you first, depending on the nature of the survey involved. If notified, you will
be asked if you will allow your child to participate. We will not notify the
child about the survey or ask him or her to participate without your permission.
For the most sensitive of subjects, we typically do not recruit potential child
panelists through our HarrisZone.com membership, but instead ask the adult
members of our HarrisPollOnline.com website if they have any children in the
appropriate age level that they would be willing to have participate in the
survey in question.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>6) Safety and Security</p>
</b><blockquote><b>
</b>
<p>The HarrisPollOnline<sup>SM</sup> and the HarrisZone<sup>SM</sup> websites
have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of
the information under our control. We will not activate a potential registrant’s
account without confirmation. Once the registration process is completed, the
individual is sent an email that requests he or she confirm his or her
registration. The account will not be activated until confirmation is received.
Additionally, all website members are required to use passwords and usernames
when registering, updating their contact information, or when accessing
"members only" sections of the websites. If a member cannot remember
his or her password, he or she can send a message to the website’s Help Desk
to retrieve it. To protect the security of our members’ contact information,
requests to retrieve passwords must include information to allow us to verify
the member’s identity.</p>
<p>We employ standard technology and internal processes to protect the
information our members release to us. Additionally, only select, authorized
employees have access to process the data collected and maintain the database
that stores member contact information. All questions are screened by Harris
Interactive staff prior to being deployed to ensure they are proper and
appropriate for their intended audiences.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A Note to Parents:</p>
</b>
<p>We encourage parents and guardians to be involved in their children’s
activities on the Web. Individuals registering for the HarrisZone<sup>SM</sup>
are encouraged to provide their parent’s email address so that we can notify
the parent when the child has registered. A parent or guardian may unsubscribe
their child from the HarrisZone<sup>SM</sup> at any time by sending an email to
the Help Desk on the registration site. In addition, this site has security
measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and change of the
information under our control.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>7) Notification of Changes</p>
</b><blockquote><b>
</b>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our
users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in
accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information
in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify
users via email. If users have opted out of all communication with the site, or
deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will
their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make
any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user
information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on
our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice
we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us,
notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
