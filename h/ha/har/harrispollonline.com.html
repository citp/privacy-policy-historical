<p class="PageSubHead"><b>1) Company Background and Websites</b></p>
<p>Harris Interactive is a worldwide market research and consulting firm most
widely known for<i> The Harris Poll</i><sup>®</sup> and for its pioneering
leadership in the online market research industry. This privacy statement covers
the following of our sites: <a href="http://www.HarrisInteractive.com">www.harrisinteractive.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.Novatris.com" target="_blank">www.novatris.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.HISBOnline.com" target="_blank">www.hisbonline.com</a>,
and <a href="http://www.HarrisPollOnline.com" target="_blank">www.harrispollonline.com</a>.
Harris Interactive is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content
of other websites. We recommend that
you carefully read the privacy policies of each site you visit.</p>
<p>Harrisinteractive.com is Harris Interactive’s corporate website including
our European operations. Novatris.com is managed by our French subsidiary.
Hisbonline.com is the website for HISB (Harris Interactive Service Bureau) a
division of Harris Interactive that provides research services to other market
research companies.</p>
<p>Harrispollonline.com is our panel members’ website which registers and conducts surveys with individuals aged 13 and over.
Children under age 13 are only contacted to participate in surveys through their
parents; they are not offered the opportunity to register for our online panels
directly. For research with teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 and children
under 13, we are careful to respect their privacy and parental concerns.</p>
<p>Our survey websites provide survey respondents with the opportunity to
express opinions and attitudes about the most current issues. We conduct
research that involves people from around the world, and provide the aggregated
results of our research (stripped of any personally identifiable information) to
a wide variety of clients, including important decision-makers in government,
major corporations, and news organizations. In addition, certain survey findings
are published on our websites so that our respondents can be among the first to
hear about the concerns and interests of people around the world. Our survey
research is what allows us to offer the services and features on our sites free
of charge.</p>
<p class="PageSubHead"><b>2) Information Collected on Harris Interactive Websites</b></p>
<p><b>Information Collected During the Registration Process</b></p>
<p>Individuals can join our growing databases of survey respondents by
registering at our harrispollonline.com
website. When registering on the websites of third parties with whom we have
developed business relationships, registration through these various means work
as follows:</p>
<p>During the registration process on harrispollonline.com (a site directed towards, intended for, and appealing to individuals age 13 and
over) we require individuals to provide us with contact information (e.g., email
address) and demographic information (e.g., gender, birth year, zip code, and
country). To allow individuals to modify their submissions at a later point in
time, we also ask registrants to establish a unique password. Individuals under
the age of 13 are prevented from registering based upon their birth year entry
on the registration form. Individuals who are age 13 are required to enter their
month and day of birth to verify they are at least 13 years of age.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive, and its subsidiaries, may provide registration
opportunities for our survey databases via surveys we conduct with individuals
age 13 or over.</p>
<p>Potential survey site members age 13 or over may also have been recruited on
our behalf by third party websites, who forwarded to us your information, with
your consent. Any additional information we collect from you, for example, to
complete registration (if it was not already completed by the third party) or
during a survey is subject to this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Individuals have the opportunity, in certain cases, to register in their
native language by selecting from a set of available languages on the main
registration page.</p>
<p>Once you become a panel member you agree to receive other Harris Poll Online
communications regarding survey invitations and reminders, sweepstakes
notification in the event you are a winner, updates to our privacy policy,
regional-specific communications in the event of a natural or other disaster,
responses to inquiries that you submit to our Survey Help Desk, and inquiries
should we receive communication from your ISP regarding your status as an Harris
Poll Online member.</p>
<p><b>Other Information Collected on Harris Interactive Websites</b></p>
<p>As part of the survey process, we will ask Harris
Poll Online panel members other demographic information (e.g., income level),
and other information related to interests, hobbies, and product/technology
usage. We collect this information
so that we can send surveys to members that correspond with their interests. We
aggregate the responses received by various broad categories to report the
aggregated results to our clients. We also summarize information about the Harris
Poll Online panel to develop statistics ensuring that the panel is
representative of the general population. We may also use
information provided by Harris Poll Online panel members to pre-qualify them for future market research that target certain demographics (male vs. female,
age, etc.).</p>
<p>Harris Interactive offers an incentive program, HIpoints, through which
participants of certain surveys can accumulate points towards award redemption
based on the number of eligible surveys in which they participate. This program
is offered in limited countries. To redeem HIpoints, panelists must provide full
name and shipping information so that we can deliver the selected items.</p>
<p>Visitors to certain areas of our websites are provided online forms to
contact us if they have questions, comments, are interested in job
opportunities, or require further information on our products or services.
Responses to such inquiries may be sent via email or regular mail within 30 days
upon receipt.</p>
<p><b>Children’s Privacy</b></p>
<p>Harris Interactive believes that it's especially important to protect
children's privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time
online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive complies with all applicable national and international
children's privacy regulations. We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). We
do not collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age. As part of the validation process for our clients, we may collect the
names of individuals who participated in a market research study, but we do not
ask the names of children who are under 13 years of age. From time to time, we
may also ask our adult panel members or respondents whether they have children
under 13 residing with them who might want to participate in a survey. In such
event, we will never collect personally identifiable information from the child,
nor will we combine other information that we collect from the child with
personally identifiable information about the child or parent.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact us about your information, any information about
your child, or to find out how you can have your child's information removed
from our database, please see the “Accessing the Information Your Provided”
section of this policy.</p>
<p class="PageSubHead"><b>3) How Information Is Used</b></p>
<p><b>Surveys</b></p>
<p>If you have joined the Harris Poll Online panel, we will use the information
you provide us primarily to contact you about surveys in which we would like you
to participate, or to provide you with the results of the surveys. We may also
notify you about new features on our websites, or other products or services
related to the primary purpose of our business in which we think you may be
interested. From time to time we may also invite our members to enter a
sweepstakes or participate in other incentive programs, most of which are
related to the running of our surveys. Any additional information you provide
when participating in an online sweepstakes or other online incentive program we
host is subject to this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive does not send unsolicited commercial emails. When we send
emails on behalf of a client, we abide by CASRO and ESOMAR standards.</p>
<p>Although not covered by the Controlling
the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM Act”),
Harris Interactive voluntarily complies with the key privacy and disclosure
provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>providing truthful sender information;</li>
  <li>including a physical address for Harris interactive or the Harris
    Interactive affiliate sending the email message; and,</li>
  <li>providing a clear and simple opt-out method which is always honored.</li>
</ul>
<p>All survey invitations sent via email are consistent with the CASRO Code of
Standards and Ethics for Survey Research.</p>
<p>As part of our survey research process, we gather, aggregate, and analyze
information from our panelists and
survey respondents. We provide the results of our research (which contain no
personally identifiable information) to our clients, which include governmental
agencies, major corporations, and other organizations. Your survey responses are
valuable in guiding the development and designing of products and services.
Survey responses are often used by our clients to make decisions on key issues.</p>
<p><b>Sharing Information</b></p>
<p>Harris Interactive is not in the business of selling your personally
identifiable information. We use the information you provide to us for internal
purposes, and share it only for the limited purposes described here:</p>
<p>In order to provide you with the services on our sites, we may need to share
your information with third parties, our agents, who perform services on our
behalf, such as merchandise (HIpoints rewards) fulfillment, web hosting, and the
like. They may also collect information on our behalf. Any personal information
collected by a third party website is in accordance to this privacy policy. For
example, the HIpoints program is managed by our agent, Incentive Logic. A
limited amount of your registration information is provided to Incentive Logic
for purposes of running the HIpoints program. This information is kept in
confidence and not used for any other purpose than to establish and track your
earned HIpoints. Incentive Logic operates the HIpoints program in accordance
with our privacy guidelines and does not share your personal information with
any third party without your permission.</p>
<p>As a company conducting market research, protecting survey participants’
privacy has been an important part of our business long before the advent of the
Internet. We know that you will not want to complete a survey if your personally
identifiable information is shared with third parties, which is why we
participated in industry-wide efforts to protect consumer information, even
before we began conducting surveys online. We follow local laws and industry
best practices with respect to the release of personally identifiable information.
Clients that receive personally identifiable information are required to sign
and abide by CASRO’s "Standards Regarding Disclosure of
Respondent-Identifiable Data to Clients," indicating that their use of the
data will be limited to research purposes and the information will remain
confidential.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive is a thriving and expanding business, and like other
companies, we sometimes acquire or spin off new business units. As part of such
transfers, we convey the business assets of the particular business unit,
including survey participant data. If a change of ownership occurs, a notice
will be posted on harrisinteractive.com
or an email will be sent to you directly. </p>
<p>Harris Interactive will periodically be engaged by our clients to build
Proprietary Panels (database of survey participants). With respect to
Proprietary Panels, data from the resulting database of respondents may also be
made available for use by the client who commissioned the research. Such
information will only be made available to the client pursuant to an agreement
with Harris Interactive that the information will be kept confidential and will
be used exclusively for research purposes. Harris Interactive’s use of
personal information you provide as part of such panels is subject to the same
provisions as indicated herein for Harris Poll Online registrants. </p>
<p>Harris Interactive websites may contain links to information on other
websites. We do not have any control over these other websites, and therefore we
cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you
provide while visiting those sites. Those sites are not governed by this privacy
policy, and if you have questions about how a site uses your information,
consult that site's privacy statement.</p>
<p><b>Legal Disclaimer</b></p>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose
personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief
that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a
court order or legal process served on our website.</p>
<p><b>Passively Collected and Stored Information - Cookies and Log Files</b></p>
<p>We passively collect information to make your browsing experience more
pleasant, and to understand what areas of our sites are more popular, what areas
may require improvement, and what technologies are being used by members of our
sites. This information helps us to update and improve our sites. We also use
this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security
breaches, to detect violations of our quality standards, for example, detecting
multiple memberships from the same user which is not permitted by our terms of
use, and to provide you with a safe online environment.</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files stored on your computer by a website that
assigns a numerical user ID and stores certain information about your online
browsing. When we use cookies, we do so to help us recognize you as a prior user
of this site. The cookie file does not store your personal information. If you
prefer not to receive cookies from our website you can disable their use in your
browser settings. By doing so you may reduce the functionality of the web pages
you view.</p>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and
store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol addresses,
browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating
system, date/time stamp and click stream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track
users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about
our user base as a whole.</p>
<p class="PageSubHead"><b>4) Accessing the Information You Provided</b></p>
<p>For panel members, not only is it important for our members to be able to
correct their information, it is important to us. The results from our public
surveys (which report aggregate, non-identifiable information) often get
reported by the media. We encourage members to keep their account profiles
up-to-date, so that we continue to have accurate demographic information behind
our results.</p>
<p>Personal information previously provided when responding to a survey, through
the Harris Poll Online site or through our French subsidiary, Novatris, may be
changed or modified by the following options:</p>

personal information when contacting us regarding any of our products or
services and would like to change or modify their information should send an
email directly to <a href="mailto:info@harrisinteractive.com">info@harrisinteractive.com</a>.</p>
<p>Responses to such inquiries may be sent via email or regular mail within 30
days upon receipt. If the user does not receive acknowledgement of their
inquiry, or if their inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, they should then
contact TRUSTe through the TRUSTe Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process (<a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>).
TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with the website to resolve users’ concerns.</p>
<p class="PageSubHead"><b>5) Your Options on Harris Interactive Websites and Opt-out Policies</b></p>
<p>For panel members, we are committed to giving you the maximum amount of
flexibility in accessing your information, and in the level of participation you
have with our sites. In each email invitation sent to members of our respondent
database, we provide the opportunity to opt-out of receipt of further mailings.
This opt-out opportunity deactivates the member's account and terminates their
membership with Harris Interactive. Our survey invitations inform you about the
subject matter of the survey in which we would like your input, whether it is in
the category of public opinion, current trends and activities, or
products/services. Any personally identifiable information that you provide
during the survey process will be subject to your consent prior to release to
our client. Should you grant release of such information, and then change your
mind, all you need do is to send an email to <a href="mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com">surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com</a>.</p>
<p>If at any point you decide that you no longer wish to be a member of Harris
Interactive’s respondent databases, you may send an email request with the
word "unsubscribe" to <a href="mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com">surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com</a>.
Panel members can also opt out by filling out a request on the Member Services
section of the website. We will retain your information in our
"unsubscribe" database, to ensure that we do not contact you in the
future for Harris Poll Online surveys. In the event we receive your email address from a client as part of a
customer database whom we will be contacting for a survey for that client, we
may contact you regarding that specific survey. You will be provided with a separate opt-out opportunity from that
survey.</p>
<p>For panel member parents, if we invite your 13-to-17 year old children to
participate in surveys covering sensitive topics, we may notify you first,
depending on the nature of the survey involved. If notified, you will be asked
if you will allow your child to participate. In such cases, we will not notify
the child about the survey or ask him or her to participate without your
permission. For the most sensitive of subjects, we typically ask the adult
members of our harrispollonline.com website if they have any children in the
appropriate age level that they would be willing to have participate in the
survey in question. Again, children under age 13 are only contacted to
participate in surveys through their parents.</p>
<p>For subscribers to any Harris Interactive newsletter, you may unsubscribe by
sending an email to <a href="mailto:newsletters@harrisinteractive.net">newsletters@harrisinteractive.net</a>
or simply click on the "One-Click Unsubscribe" in the footer of the
email in which you received with this newsletter.</p>
<p>For all other users of Harris Interactive sites who may have provided
personal information when contacting us regarding any of
our products or services and would like to be removed from our contact list
should send an email directly to <a href="mailto:info@harrisinteractive.com">info@harrisinteractive.com</a>.</p>
<p class="PageSubHead"><b>6) Safety and Security</b></p>
<p>The Harris Interactive websites have security measures in place to prevent
the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We will
not activate a potential registrant’s account without confirmation. Once the
registration process is completed, the individual is sent an email that requests
he or she confirm his or her registration. The account will not be activated
until confirmation is received. Additionally, all website members are required
to use their passwords and usernames (email addresses) when registering,
updating their contact information, or when accessing "members only"
sections of the websites. If a member cannot remember his or her password, he or
she can send a message to the website’s Help Desk to retrieve it. To protect
the security of our members’ contact information, requests to retrieve
passwords must include information to allow us to verify the member’s
identity.</p>
<p>We employ standard technology and internal processes to protect the
information our members release to us. Additionally, only select, authorized
employees have access to process the data collected and maintain the database
that stores member contact information.</p>
<p>While navigating Harris Interactive websites you may be directed to content
or functionality that is hosted by a third party supplier, not on a Harris
Interactive owned domain. For example, this is done on our Careers webpages.
When information is collected on behalf of Harris Interactive exclusively,
Harris Interactive privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern
how your information is used. For other, non-Harris Interactive sites, the site
owner's privacy policy will be referenced.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive also safeguards all information it collects through its
websites from unauthorized access. Only
authorized Harris Interactive employees or agents carrying out permitted
business functions are allowed to access this information. In addition, each
employee of Harris Interactive is required to sign a confidentiality agreement
requiring him or her to keep confidential all personal information of panel
members. Employees who violate the
confidentiality agreement are subject to disciplinary actions, including
termination when appropriate.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Harris Interactive suffers a breach of its
security systems and an individual or entity gains unauthorized access to any
information stored on Harris Interactive servers, Harris Interactive will
immediately investigate such security breach, and will provide prompt notice to
any individual whose information was affected.</p>
<p class="PageSubHead"><b>7) Notification of Changes</b></p>
<p>We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the
information was collected. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable
information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we
will notify users via email. If users have opted out of all communication with
the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted,
nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if
we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user
information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on
our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice
we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us,
notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the user of any Harris Interactive website to
check for updates to this privacy policy which was most recently updated on
September 1, 2006.</p>
