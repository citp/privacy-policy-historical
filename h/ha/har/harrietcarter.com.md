**What Are Cookies and Should I Worry About Them?**  
  
Cookies are small pieces of information that many web sites use to make online navigation easier. This data is contained on your hard drive in a file, which your web browser provides for the purpose. A cookie can contain information such as a user ID. Our site can't read other data on your hard drive or read cookies created by other sites.

Once you make a purchase from our online store, your name becomes a part of our customer file. As a valued Harriet Carter customer you may want to receive catalog mailings from us in the future. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please send an email to our [Customer Service Department](http://www.harrietcarter.com/contact_customer_service.cfm) or send the mailing label from the back of your catalog and attach it to a piece of paper with your request. Mail this information to Mail Preference Service, Harriet Carter Gifts, Inc., 425 Stump Road, North Wales, PA 19454.  
  
You may also receive mailings from other carefully screened companies with whom we sometimes share our valued customer list.

Another form of third party information that may be used is personally identifiable information submitted for another person by you. For instance, if you want to buy a gift for a friend and have it shipped to them. Other than that, HarrietCarter.com does not sell, rent, or give away your personal information to anyone. Also, we may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to: 

  1. comply with the law,
  2. enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or 
  3. protect the rights, property, or safety of HarrietCarter.com and our users, or others.

When you use the "Email-A-Friend" option...  
This unique feature allows you to share information about a particular item or wish list that you think may be interesting to another individual. We do not retain your friends name or email address, share their information with outside parties, nor does Harriet Carter contact them.
