          Last Updated: July 23rd, 2005<p align="justify">JS&amp;M Sales &amp; Marketing Inc. strives 
          to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and 
          to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use 
          Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street 
          address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy 
          policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any 
          unauthorized third party. Period."</p>
          <p align="justify">How we gather information from users</p>
          <p align="justify">How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
          visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the 
          services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide 
          information when you register for access to certain portions of our 
          site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make 
          a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
          sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
          interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, our company also 
          collects information automatically and through the use of electronic 
          tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log 
          the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to 
          recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other 
          things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you 
          from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may 
          control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement 
          while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may 
          also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can 
          choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your 
          browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable 
          to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter 
          your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the 
          site’s features according to your preferences.</p>
          <p align="justify">What we do with the information we collect</p>
          <p align="justify">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your 
          visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We 
          respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
          <p align="justify">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
          identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine 
          information about your usage patterns with similar information 
          obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., 
          to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most 
          attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with 
          our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does 
          not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow 
          anyone to identify you individually.</p>
          <p align="justify">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on JS&amp;M 
          Sales &amp; Marketing Inc., hardtofindseminars.com, hardtofindads.com and 
          idpen.com and our other company web sites to communicate with you 
          about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of 
          Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by JS&amp;M 
          Sales &amp; Marketing Inc. and other topics we think you might find of 
          interest. </p>
          <p align="justify">Personally Identifiable Information collected by JS&amp;M Sales &amp; 
          Marketing Inc., hardtofindseminars.com, and our company web sites may 
          also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site 
          administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce 
          transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
          communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical 
          support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for 
          example) may access such information. We will use your information 
          only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
          continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner 
          with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
          information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose 
          your information in response to a court order, at other times when we 
          believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with 
          the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement 
          authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note 
          we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
          <p align="justify">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
          <p align="justify">JS&amp;M Sales &amp; Marketing Inc., hardtofindseminars.com, and our 
          company web sites expect its partners, advertisers and affiliates to 
          respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third 
          parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other 
          content providers accessible through our site, may have their own 
          privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, 
          during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a 
          frame of content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. 
          Also, through our company web sites you may be introduced to, or be

          not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You

          third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to 
          identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. 
          For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and 
          may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether 
          you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features 
          available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and 
          may use cookies or other technology to gather information. JS&amp;M Sales 
          &amp; Marketing Inc. does not control the use of this technology by third 
          parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any 
          actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
          <p align="justify">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose 
          Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat 
          areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected 
          and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in 
          unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such
