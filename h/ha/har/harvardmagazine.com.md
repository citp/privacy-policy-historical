We collect and store e-mail addresses; however, we do not share or sell e-mail addresses or any other personally identifiable information about our Web visitors outside of Harvard—including those visitors who make donations through our site.

Besides e-mail addresses, the information we may request on our Web forms includes: names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and descriptive information (such as one’s Harvard affiliation and graduation year). We use this information to respond to specific requests, to personalize our communications, to communicate with subsets of our target audience, or to allow visitors to identify themselves when making use of such features as Cambridge 02138 (letters to the editor), website comments, and alumni class notes.

Some members of _Harvard Magazine_ ’s staff are authorized to cross-check information collected by this website against information stored in Harvard University databases (maintained elsewhere). _Harvard Magazine_  does not retain external data; when we are authorized to access Harvard University data, we handle it very carefully, use it only for specific business purposes, and then discard it using secure means.

Our Web server generates log files of the [IP addresses ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address)of computers that access this website and of what files they access. These logs may be archived.
