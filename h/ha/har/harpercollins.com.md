Personally identifiable information about visitors to this Site (that is, information such as a visitor's name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number) is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted'such information may be requested in connection with our sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, guestbooks, requests for suggestions, visitors. requests for products or services, and visitors. requests for additional information. HarperCollins does not require a visitor to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the online activity he or she is interested in.

The identity of the entities collecting personal information will be clear at the time your personal information is collected. A detailed description of shared use can also be found in the specific Terms of Use for this Site, and in the rules for specific sweepstakes and promotions.

_**WHAT HARPERCOLLINS DOES (AND DOESN' T DO) WITH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**_

_General_. HarperCollins uses personally identifiable information only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses at the time of collection, in which case you will have the opportunity to instruct us not to use your data in other ways (i.e., "opt-out").

_Sharing Personal Information_. HarperCollins may share personally identifiable information with other News Corp. affiliates or with some of our business partners who would like to send you information about their products or services. However, when we collect your information you will have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information in these ways (i.e., "opt-out"). 

_**LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES**_  

HarperCollins has established relationships with advertisers and reputable business partners that allow visitors to our Site to link directly to sites operated by these partners'some of these sites, may be "co-branded" with a HarperCollins logo; however, they are not operated or maintained by HarperCollins. These sites may collect personal information from you. This Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner from our partners.

HarperCollins chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, HarperCollins is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Site. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by HarperCollins of the content, policies or practices of such third party sites. We are not responsible for any information these sites may obtain and do not oversee their policies or practices in collecting personal information. Therefore, once you have left this Site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site.

This Site may also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated with HarperCollins and/or News Corp. HarperCollins may share information collected by these affiliated companies; however, this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we receive in this manner. Visitors to our affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices when providing any personally identifiable information.

_**NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**_  

When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which web pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks, if any, were "clicked" by the visitor. HarperCollins, like most major web sites, collects such information by placing small bits of information, known as "cookies", on the hard drive of your computer to log IP addresses, operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), type of browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) used by each visitor to the Site.

Cookies enable us to do a number of things to make your visit and future visits to the site more enjoyable. For example, cookies allow a visitor to quickly log on to a site he/she has used before by storing a password. By tracking how many people visit our Site and where they go, we are able to determine which part of the Site users like the best, which part needs some improvement and what changes should be made. By obtaining this information, we are able to continually improve our Site and bring you the best online experience possible.

Although the cookie itself does not collect any personally identifiable information about a visitor, and HarperCollins does not use cookies in order to obtain such information, the cookie can be used to determine the IP address of the visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity to the Internet. HarperCollins may also disclose some of the non-personally identifiable information we obtain to advertisers to inform them how many people have seen or linked to their advertisements on our Site. However, we do not disclose personally identifiable information to these advertisers. Visitors may also receive cookies from third parties, but HarperCollins cannot control the content of these cookies.

HarperCollins does not save credit card information in a cookie.

You should consult your browser owner's manual for instructions on how to refuse cookies.

_**REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**_

Visitors may review or delete personal information from our records at anytime. If you would like to know the types of information that we collect from visitors to the Site, please contact us at [**feedback@harpercollins.com**](mailto:feedback@harpercollins.com) **** or write to us at **HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., Attn: Jaime Ciampi,10 East 53 rd Street, New York, NY 10022**. If you would like to to know whether we have collected personal information about you, please provide us with the activities that you participated in on the Site which requested personal information. After we have reviewed the relevant databases, we will confirm whether we have collected such information about you. Prior to changing or deleting such infromation, we require that you provide us with proof of your name and address, such as a valid driver's license. Once we have received such proof and determined that it is satisfactory, we will immediately delete or modify your information in our database and refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable information from you, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. This residual information will not be given to any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.

_**SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**_

HarperCollins has established and maintains reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information collected by this Site.

**II. _ADDITIONAL POLICIES THAT APPLY TO CHILDREN UNDER 13_**

_**KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY**_

We at HarperCollins understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other forms of interactivity. HarperCollins also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information this Site collects from children. Parents of children who visit this Site can be confident that any personal information that may be provided to this Site will be collected and maintained in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). HarperCollins encourages parents to supervise their children's activities online and to participate with their children's online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise their children's activities on the Internet. That's why HarperCollins has developed a Site that parents can feel is safe for their children and kids will find cool, informative, educational, and fun! Because there's always room for improvement, HarperCollins welcomes any suggestions on how to make the Site a better, _safer_ place to hang out.

_**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13**_  

When a visitor to our Site is under the age of 13, HarperCollins does not require the disclosure of more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity as a condition of such participation.

HarperCollins may use different types of personally identifiable information submitted to this Site by children under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below. In each instance, we comply with the parental consent requirements of COPPA.

  1. _Use of a Child's Information by HarperCollins_


    * We may collect a child's email address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or game for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a contest winner). This information will not be used to re-contact the child, and will be deleted from our records when the contest or game is over. Parental consent will be obtained before we send the winner a prize.


        * We may collect a child's email address in order to respond more than once to a child's specific request. For example, the child may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online communications from HarperCollins. In these instances HarperCollins will also obtain a parent's email address along with the child's. Before any further contact with the child, HarperCollins will send an email to the parent (a) notifying him or her we have collected the child's email address in order to respond more than once to the child's request for a subscription, information, etc; (b) informing the parent that he or she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (c) informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the email within 72 hours, HarperCollins may use the child's information for the purpose for which it was submitted.


        * We may collect a child's personally identifiable information (including name, email address, mailing address and phone number) for such activities as chats, forums, surveys, games, guestbooks, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, content submissions, requests for products or services, or requests for additional information. In these instances we will initially collect only the child's name and online contact information and the email address of the child's parent. Before using this information for any purpose, we will send the parent an email that (a) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's personal information and need the parent's consent to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a link to access to this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA. If the proposed use of the child's personal information does not involve disclosure to a third party, then HarperCollins will ask the parent to provide consent by return email. Upon receipt of the email consent, we will send the parent a confirming email. If the proposed use of the child's personal information involves disclosure to third parties, the email we send to the parent will ask the parent either to (i) return by postal mail or fax a consent form that will be attached to the email, or (ii) call a toll free number where consent can be given over the phone. If parental consent is not obtained by one of these methods within **one week** HarperCollins will delete all of the child's and parent's personally identifiable information from its records. In addition, parents can revoke a prior consent at any time.


        * We may collect a child's name and email address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Site, to protect against liability or as required or permitted by law. Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.


  2. _Sharing Children's Personal Information With Third Parties_. HarperCollins may share a child's personal information with other News Corp. affiliates who may send you information about their products or services **.** These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information they obtain from HarperCollins. As noted above, parents may exercise their option not to consent to the disclosure of their child's personal information to third parties. Parents may consent to HarperCollins's collection and use of a child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties. 



_**LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES**_  

As noted in Section I of this Privacy Policy, this Site may link directly to sites operated by HarperCollins advertisers, business partners and affiliated companies. Those sites, which are not controlled by HarperCollins may collect personal information from your child. Parents should therefore check the relevant site's privacy policy to understand how it collects and uses children's personal information. HarperCollins will not share in any personal information obtained by a site from a child under the age of 13 unless that site follows the requirements of COPPA.

_**REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13**_

Parents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal information about their children from our records at any time. If you would like to know the types of information we collect about children, please contact us at [**feedback@harpercollins.com**](mailto:feedback@harpercollins.com) or write to us at **HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., Attn: Jaime Ciampi, 10 East 53 rd Street, New York, NY 10022**. If you would like to know whether we have collected personal information about your child, please provide us with the activities that he or she participated in on the Site which requested personal information. After we have reviewed the relevant databases, we will confirm whether we have collected such information about your child. Prior to changing or deleting such information, we require that you provide us with proof of your name and address, such as a valid driver's license, and proof that your child resides with you or is otherwise in your custody. Once we have received such proof and determined that it is satisfactory, we will immediately delete or modify your child's information in our database and refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable information from your child, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. This residual information will not be given to any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.
