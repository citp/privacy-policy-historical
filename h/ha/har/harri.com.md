  * #### Personal data that we collect

  


##### Harri Profile

We collect and process your personal data when you create a profile on Harri. We are the controller for your Harri profile at all times. We are not the controller for data that is created or processed by any employer; we are the processor for that data.

In order to create a profile, we need your name, email address, phone number, your employment details, if you have them (employer, position, duties, dates) and education (institution, location, qualification, dates). We ask you to describe yourself in three words and to write a bit about yourself for your profile. We ask for your references, if you have any. You also have the option to upload your CV and a photograph of yourself. Providing this additional information is entirely voluntary but will greatly assist you in your job search.

When you create a Harri profile, you will be automatically included in our Talent Community. Being part of our Talent Community allows us to send you jobs that you might be interested in and it also makes your profile searchable and contactable by employers who can invite you to apply for positions. You can’t create a Harri profile without being included in the Talent Community

When you visit our website, we will record your computer's IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, and the URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting our website. This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our services. We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users and to monitor overall usage trends, metrics, page views, etc.

  


##### Applying for jobs

You can use your Harri profile to apply for jobs on our platform or to apply for a job with an employer. When you apply for a job, the employer becomes the controller for any of your personal data that they use or create during the employment process. Please read the Fair Processing Notice (Privacy Notice) of each employer to see how they will handle your personal data. 

As the controller for the recruitment/ employment process, the employer will have access to your application and will be able to use it to assess your suitability as a candidate with them. For example, the employer can use Harri to schedule interviews, make recruitment notes and to ask you specific questions during the recruitment process.

  * #### How we use your personal data

Harri is a platform that allows you to create a Harri profile. We use your personal data to create this profile for you and to send you communications regarding that profile. Harri is the controller for this profile.

Employers will use Harri in the recruitment/ employment process and we are a processor for the employer. The employer is the controller of the process once you choose to apply for a job with them.

We will share your personal data with organisations that perform services or functions on our behalf, including cloud storage and web hosting providers, email service providers, and software maintenance service providers. We must necessarily share your information with these organisations for them to perform their functions.

If requested or required by law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, we may disclose any information we have collected from you. We also may disclose your information to exercise or protect our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these business transfers, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

We share your personal data between our UK entity, our Ramallah entity and our US parent in order to provide the software service and for administrative reasons. The sharing of your personal data is protected by the use of Standard Contractual Clauses (EU Model Contracts).

  * #### Our legal basis for processing your personal data

We need a legal basis in order to process your personal data. Creating a Harri profile is entirely your choice, so our legal basis for its processing is with your consent. You can put in as much or as little information as you like. You can withdraw your consent at any time by requesting that your profile be deleted and that you are removed from the Talent Community.If you have applied for a job, we will pass your deletion request over to the employers. They will then handle your request.

We share your data between our UK, USA and Ramallah entities using the legal basis of legitimate interest as the sharing is for administrative purposes.

We share your data with organisations that perform services for us and this is a legitimate activity.

We will use your technical data for analytical purposes and to improve our services and this is a legitimate activity.

We will disclose your data if we are required to do so in response to a legal obligation. 

We will disclose your data to our advisors, as required, and this is a legitimate interest.

  * #### Automated decision making

Harri does not use any automated decision making. However, an employer might use automated decision-making in their recruitment questions. Please read their Fair Processing Notice for more information on their recruitment process.

  * #### Security of personal data

The security of your personal data is important to us and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the personal data that we have collected from you.

  * #### International Transfer of personal data

Your personal data will be transferred to — and maintained on — computers and servers located outside of your country where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide personal data to us, please note that we transfer personal data to the United States and process it there pursuant to our Standard Contractual Clauses (EU Model Contracts). We also transfer personal data to Ramallah, Palestine, and process it there pursuant to our Standard Contractual Clauses (EU Model Contracts).

European data protection laws permit the European Commission to make decisions about the adequacy of protection for personal data in respect of transfers which are binding on EU member states. These laws recognise that if a data exporter adopts the “standard contractual clauses” adopted by the European Commission, this will provide an adequate safeguard as required by law. We have Standard Contractual Clauses in place with our entity in Ramallah, Palestine and our entity in the USA.

We commit to cooperate with EU data protection authorities and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to personal data and human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.

In particular, as further specified in this Fair Processing Notice, we will maintain compliance with data protection principles by adhering to the following practices:

**Notice**

When we collect your personal data, we’ll give you timely and appropriate notice describing what personal data we’re collecting, how we’ll use it, and the types of third parties with whom we may share it. This Fair Processing Notice serves as such notice, and any changes to our collection, use or disclosure of your personal data will be reflected in revisions to the Fair Processing Notice posted on our website.

**Choice**

As established and described in this Fair Processing Notice, we’ll give you choices about the ways we use and share your personal data, and we’ll respect the choices you make.

**Accountability for Onward Transfer**

If we transfer your personal data to another country, we may remain liable and will take appropriate measures to protect your privacy and the personal data we transfer.

**Security**

We’ll take appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

**Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation**

We’ll collect only as much personal data as we need for specific, identified purposes, and we won’t use it for other purposes without having a correct legal basis. We’ll take appropriate steps to make sure the personal data in our records is accurate.

Where we retain information for service improvement and development, it will be anonymized and used to uncover collective insights about the use of our services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.

If the services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we are the processor for that personal data. The retention period for this data is decided upon by the employer. If your account is deactivated, the information that you have given to your employer will remain (please see the employer’s Fair Processing Notice).
