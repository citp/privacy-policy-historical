We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party services, websites and applications, and we do not endorse or promote such third-party websites, applications and services. This Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use do not apply to any third-party service, website or application.

**Additional Information and Rights Applicable to Individuals Located in the EEA**

**Legal basis for processing**

Under the GDPR, we are required to tell you the legal basis we are relying on to process your personally identifiable information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

Where your information is completely anonymized, we do not require a legal basis to use it as the information will no longer constitute personally identifiable information that is regulated under data protection laws. However, our collection and use of such anonymized information may be subject to other laws where your consent is required. Please see the section entitled “ _Cookies and Similar Technologies_ ” above for further details.

**Duration of processing**

Regarding personally identifiable information we have processed in connection with the supply of our products and services to any person or organization, we will retain personally identifiable information relevant to that supply of products or services for six years from the date of supply and in compliance with our obligations under the GDPR (or similar legislation around the world).

**Sharing Personally Identifiable Information**

We will only share personally identifiable information with others when we are legally permitted to do so. When we share personally identifiable information with others, we put contractual arrangements and security mechanisms in place to protect the personally identifiable information and to comply with our data protection, confidentiality and security standards.

Such third parties may include, for example, providers of information technology, cloud based software as a service providers, identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services.

**Transfers of your Personally Identifiable Information Outside the EEA**

We are a U.S. organization and many of our suppliers are U.S. organizations. Therefore when you submit personally identifiable information through our Sites, your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United States of America where it will be stored and processed by us and, where applicable, our suppliers and other third parties referred to in this Privacy Policy for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. The laws of the United States of America may not offer the same standard of legal protection for your personally identifiable information that you enjoy in your own country. However, we will comply with our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to your personally identifiable information including having a lawful basis for transferring your personally identifiable information and putting appropriate safeguards in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your personally identifiable information where it is transferred outside the EEA. Where we are transferring, storing or processing your personally identifiable information outside the EEA not strictly for the purpose of providing our services (e.g. to send you marketing), we shall only do so with your consent.

**Your Rights**

You have the following rights in relation to the personally identifiable information we hold about you:

_**Your right of access:**_ If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your personally identifiable information and, if so, provide you with a copy of that personally identifiable information (along with certain other details).

It won’t stop us from storing your personally identifiable information, though. We will tell you before we lift any restriction. If we have shared your personally identifiable information with others, we will let them know about the restriction where it is possible for us to do so. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we will also tell you who we have shared your personally identifiable information with so that you can contact them directly.

_**Your rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling:**_ You have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automatic processing, including profiling, if it produces a legal effect or similarly significantly affects you, unless such profiling is necessary for the entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us.
