#### HammerZone.com and Cookies:

We recently discovered that HammerZone's web server places a "cookie" (a small identifying number) on your web browser, which means that the web server may recognize your computer if/when you visit HammerZone.com again. It's our understanding that most web servers do this.

While the server may keep track of when you visited, what pages you looked at, and how long you stayed, we don't know _how_ to access the raw data. And if we could access this information, we wouldn't know _what_ to do with it. We may have enough computer knowledge to create web pages, but the topic of web browser cookies is far above our skill level. We do know that the server uses these cookies when it creates various web traffic reports, but the reports do not identify any person or organization.
