<h2>Job Applicants</h2>

<p>We process personal data relating to those who apply for job vacancies with us or who send speculative job applications to us. We do this for employment purposes, to assist us in the selection of candidates for employment, and to assist in the running of the business. The personal data may include identifiers such as name, date of birth, personal characteristics such as gender, qualifications and previous employment history.</p>
<p>We will not share any identifiable information about you with third parties without your consent unless the law allows or requires us to do so.

<p>This privacy notice does not form part of an employment offer or contract between us. If we make an employment offer to you, we will provide further information about our handling of your personal information in an employment context separately.</p>

<h2>Where we store your personal data </h2>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").</p>

<p>It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. </p>

<p>By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. </p>

<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our suppliers’ secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted [using SSL technology]. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We will use reasonable endeavours to protect your personal data, but we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. </p>

<h2>How long we store your personal data for </h2>
<p>We store your personal data in accordance with our data retention policy. This policy is reviewed and updated internally to ensure we do not store your data for longer than is necessary. We also review how and where we store any data to ensure that we meet our obligation to store data securely. </p>

<p>In addition, some of the data we hold may be subject to certain legal and regulatory obligations, which provide a minimum retention period for different types of data. The retention period varies depending on the data we hold. </p>

<p>We use information held about you in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</li>

<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</li>
<li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
</ul><br>

<li>If Hamleys of London Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
