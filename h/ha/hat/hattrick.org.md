**Hattrick Ltd, a company with its registered address at Suites 41/42, Victoria House, 26 Main Street, Gibraltar,** publisher of Hattrick.org, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this [Web site.](http://www.hattrick.org/)

Hattrick has under the Gibraltar Data Protection Ordinance of 2004 registered as Data Controller with the Gibraltar Data Protection Commissioner (<http://www.gra.gi/index.php?site=dataprotection>). 

Hattrick processes the data itself and is the legal entity responsible for processing the data. Further, Hattrick's Game Masters, as a part of administering and supervising the games, act as Hattrick's data assistants and process the data, within and outside the EEA area. The game masters have entered into confidentiality agreements with Hattrick to protect your privacy. Since the game masters act as data processors the game masters have no independent responsibility for the processing but all such responsibility is borne by Hattrick Ltd. 

**Purpose of Hattrick's processing**  
Hattrick will process your data for the purposes of operating and administering Hattrick, to gather statistics and in supervising adherence to these terms and conditions and the Game Rules and for the specific purposes explained below. 

**Data Collected**  
Hattrick stores user data that has either been submitted to our system by you (such as account details or in-game communication), data that has been created or logged automatically by our systems (for example IP logs or game updates), as well as any manual notes that has been added by customer service, developers or Game Masters to record account events. 

**Information Automatically Logged**  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. IP addresses are also logged and used for security purposes, and may be used in abuse investigations or to identify cheaters within the game itself. 

**Cookies**  
We do not use cookies to extract information from you, solely to simplify your visits, mainly by having cookies remember which language and specific part of the site you want to start your visit with, or to remember last login date so that we can distinguish new users from returning ones. A temporary cookie is also used to keep track of your "session". Without that temporary cookie (which is not stored after you quit your browser) you would have had to log on again on each page. You can turn off cookies in your web browser (more information about this is available at <http://www.aboutcookies.org/>). This will however make it more or less impossible to access many of the functions on our web site. When you follow links from Hattrick to other web sites, these may install tracking cookies on your computer. This is beyond the control of Hattrick. 

**Advertisers**  
We reserve the right to use cookies for the purpose of serving and/or targeting ads, offers and other marketing messages. 

No personal customer data is ever shared with the advertising companies. 

**Registration Forms**  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name, e-mail, and postal address). 

Contact information from the registration forms is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. It is in the users interest to submit truthful information, as this is also used to verify the user's right to his or her account. 

The customer's e-mail address is used to send an e-mail verification message, Hattrick newsletters (this can be opted out from), password reminders upon request, inactivity reminders, subscription expiration reminders, order confirmations, information about changes in the terms of use and very seldomly information about new features to users with deleted accounts. 

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

**Order Forms**  
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect contact information (like their e-mail address), and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). 

Contact information from the order forms is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. 

Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. 

**Surveys**  
Our occasional voluntary online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). 

Contact information from the surveys is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. 

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

Sponsors, business partners, co-branded sites or content providers may get the opportunity to offer products and services to you within the Hattrick web site, but we will ask you before passing on any of your personal information to other parties. The only exception is if another company needs the data for the operation of the service and they agree to adhere to our privacy policy or if Hattrick would transfer substantially all of its assets relating to the game to another company. 

**Public Forums**  
This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

Barring a court order, we will not share such information with third parties other than the police, our Game Masters, our system administrators, our legal representatives and companies that develop or operate the game and have agreed to adhere to our privacy policy.
