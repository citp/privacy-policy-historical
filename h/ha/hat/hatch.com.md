As this website provides the opportunity to apply for employment, the personal information that you provide to us in the application process will be stored and processed by a third party based in the United States and transferred to relevant Hatch employees for the purposes of considering you for career opportunities within Hatch. We may also collect information from public sources, educational institutions and other third parties such as former employers and referees to verify or add to information you have provided to us.

Hatch is committed to neither use nor disclose personal information that it has collected, other than the purpose for which it was collected or any reasonable secondary purpose, including compliance with applicable laws. It is Hatch’s policy to obtain your written consent before it uses personal information for a purpose or in a manner different to the purpose or manner that was disclosed to you. However Hatch may collect and provide statistics about the web site and its users to other third parties. To assist us in providing a quality service to you and to evaluate our website a "cookie" (a data file that may be written to your computer by a web site) may be used.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information from disclosure other than as permitted by this Privacy Statement. We take all reasonable security measures to protect personal information from loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification or disclosure. As far as permissible under law, you acknowledge that Hatch accepts no responsibility for the unauthorized access of personal information held by Hatch. You can also play an important role in keeping your information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and login details used on this site.
