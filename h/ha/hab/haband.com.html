If our privacy policy changes, we will notify you by publishing the new policy on our Site together with its effective date. Once effective, the new policy will apply to all personal information we currently hold, whether collected before or after the new policy's effective date. We encourage you to periodically review our current privacy policy.</p><p><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p><p><a id="sec10"></a><strong>How to Contact Us</strong></p><p>Our customers come first.

We have created this easy-to-read privacy policy with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our privacy policy into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary"; it is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the privacy policy upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our privacy policy. For this reason, you should rely on our privacy policy as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.</p><p><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p><p><a id="sec12"></a><strong>Patent Disclosure</strong></p><p>One or more patents may apply to this Site or those of our affiliated brands, including without limitation, U.S. Patent #5,528,490; #5,761,649; and #6,029,142.</p><p><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p></div></div><div class="clearer"></div></div><div class="mailingListContainer"><h1>Haband Email List</h1><p>Join the Haband mailing list to receive Haband news and special offers.</p><form id="layoutMailingListForm" name="layoutMailingListForm" action="/index.cfm" method="post"><input type="hidden" name="fuseaction" value="account.start"> <input type="text" id="layoutMailingListEmailAddress" name="emailAddress" value="" class="input-text input-type-text" title="Email address"> <input type="image" src="/images/site1/shared/join.gif" alt="Join" class="input-type-image"></form></div><div class="footerWrapperContainer"><div class="footerContainer"><dl class="shopByDepartmentContainer"><dt>Shop By Department</dt><dd><ul><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/category.content/categoryID/88227b9c-b033-4aef-a9fc-14e7409a0e47/" title="Men">Men</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/category.content/categoryID/40453320-f829-4c2b-923e-01b3c1263cb7/" title="Women">Women</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/category.content/categoryID/6b347083-e71e-43be-9354-ca1b37551ce7/" title="Shoes">Shoes</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/category.content/categoryID/028c1e77-696b-4725-bcf0-1f5bc691fb1b/" title="Home &amp; Living">Home &amp; Living</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/category.content/categoryID/6e6b13d1-7888-4dee-9339-218fc08dbedb/" title="Web Only Specials">Web Only Specials</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/category.content/categoryID/8466812c-6d5e-4909-a53c-2b5b834b6c1e/" title="Clearance">Clearance</a></li></ul></dd></dl><dl class="shoppingServicesContainer"><dt>Shopping Services</dt><dd><ul><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction//index.cfm/fuseaction/content.page/nodeID/34a863c4-71c8-4978-9842-7cb404071cb5//" title="Dukes Corner">Duke's Corner</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/wishList.edit/" title="Wishlist">Wishlist</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/content.page/nodeID/2599065a-4721-448f-8d2f-80b99da25cda/" title="F.A.Q.">F.A.Q.</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/orderHistory.publicSearchForm" title="Order Tracking &amp; History">Order Tracking &amp; History</a></li><li><a href="mailto:service@haband.net" title="Customer Service">Customer Service</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/content.siteMap/" title="Site Map">Site Map</a></li></ul></dd></dl><dl class="aboutHabandContainer"><dt>About Haband</dt><dd><ul><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/content.page/nodeID/a0fa0281-6613-4e50-ad20-e840a658a493/" title="Company Information">Company Information</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/content.page/nodeID/f7f7ccf2-6e40-4e33-88ba-7ea01d1494e3/" title="Site Security">Site Security</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/content.page/nodeID/21ba23b6-5366-441e-b26a-a1108bdda426/" title="Affiliate Program">Affiliate Program</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/content.page/nodeID/3fcbd794-1455-45a0-8dab-0292b0a39337/" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/index.cfm/fuseaction/content.page/nodeID/c585528a-467c-4537-8912-4e7a0241689a/" title="Email Us">Email Us</a></li></ul></dd></dl><dl class="quickOrder2Container"><dt>Quick Order</dt><dd>Have a Haband Ad or Flyer in hand?
