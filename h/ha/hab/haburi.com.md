### Security Policy 

In order to process your order, we need your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit/debit card number, expiry date, security number for credit cards (last 3 digits on the back of the card, where signature is) and online PIN for debit cards (as supplied to you by your bank).

We search the files of credit reference agencies who record the search and share information about you and the conduct of your account with them, other lenders and relevant third parties. We check all details with fraud prevention agencies and if anyone gives us false or inaccurate information, which causes us to suspect fraud, we record it. We, and other organisations, use such records to make credit decisions and various kinds of insurance proposals and claims for you, members of your household and those with whom you are financially linked. This is done to prove identity for money laundering and fraud prevention. We may also use your information, including shopping habits, to open and run your credit account, including payment recovery, debtor tracing and for our marketing purposes. We may contact you for marketing purposes by mail, telephone, e-mail.

dress-for-less uses the latest encryption standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to make sure orders and personal data can only be read by our computers and staff.

### Internet Technologies 

### Google 

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files stored on your computer which facilitate an analysis of your use of the website. The information that the cookie generates about your use of this website is usually sent to and saved on a Google server in the USA. In case of an activation of the IP anonymisation on this website, however, your IP address will be shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address will be disclosed to and shortened on a Google server in the USA. On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information in order to evaluate your use of the website, to gather reports about website activities and to provide further services associated with the use of the website and the Internet towards the website operator.

The IP address transmitted from your browser through Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. You can prevent the cookies from being saved using a corresponding setting in your browser software; but we would like to make you aware that in this case it may not be possible to fully use all functions of this website. You can also prevent data recorded by the cookie related to your use of the website (including your IP address) from being sent to and processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: [Link](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de).

### What is a cookie and how does dress-for-less use them? 

We are using cookies on several websites, to make the visit on our website more attractive and to allow the use of certain functions. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer. Most of our used cookies is deleted from your hard drive after the browser session(so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your computer and allow us to recognize your computer during your next visit (so-called long-term - cookies). These cookies are used to greet you with your username and spare you to re-enter your password or to fill out forms with your data in following orders.

You can prevent cookies from being saved in your browser by clicking the menu bar in your browser "Tools> Internet Options> Privacy" (Internet Explorer) or "Settings> Privacy" (Firefox). Please note that without cookies certain features on our website cannot be used.

### Re-Targeting 

Information on the website visitor''s surfing behaviour is collected on our pages in anonymised form for marketing purposes and is saved in cookies by means of so-called re-targeting technologies. This technique facilitates an analysis of the Internet users'' surfing behaviour by means of an algorithm so they can subsequently be notified about selective product recommendations as a suitable advertising banner when other websites are visited. We are convinced that the display of personalised, interest-based advertising is generally more interesting to the Internet user than advertising without such personal reference.

This form of advertising is carried out anonymously altogether. The data can by no means be used to personally identify the website visitor. The collected data are merely used to improve the promotional offers. There is no other use or transmission to third parties.

On each displayed banner there is usually an "i" (for information) which opens on mouseover and leads to a page on which the system is explained and an opt-out is offered on click. An opt-out cookie is set if you click on "opt-out" which disables the display of these banners in future.

There is no direct option to opt out on the Google banners. You can object to the completely anonymous analysis of your surfing behaviour through Google by clicking on the two following links for removal: [Google Austragung](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). More information on the Google technology can be gathered from the [Google data protection regulations](http://www.google.de/intl/de/privacy/privacy-policy.html).

### Klarna data protection warning 

**Use of personal data when choosing Klarna as payment method**

If you have chosen Klarna's payment services Klarna Invoice and Klarna Account as payment methods, you have agreed that we collect and submit to Klarna following personal data required for the execution of the purchase on invoice and for proof of identity and creditworthiness, such as first and last name, address, date of birth, sex, e-mail address, IP address, telephone number and the data required for the execution of the purchase on invoice linked to the purchase order, such as number of articles, item number, invoice amount and taxes in per cent. The data will be disclosed so Klarna can make out an invoice and verify your identity and creditworthiness for the execution of your purchase with your chosen payment method. According to the German Data Protection Act, Klarna has a legitimate interest in submitting the buyer's personal data and needs them in order to gather information about identity and creditworthiness from the credit reference agency. In Germany, following credit reference agencies can be asked for advice:

* Schufa Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, 65203 Wiesbaden  
* Bürgel Wirtschaftsinformationen GmbH & Co. KG, Postfach 5001 66, 22701 Hamburg  
* Creditreform Bremen Seddig KG, Contrescarpe 17, 28203 Bremen  
* infoscore Consumer Data GmbH, Rheinstraße 99, 76532 Baden-Baden

With regard to the decisions on creation, execution or termination of the contract, Klarna also collects and uses information (apart from address verification) about the buyer's previous paying behaviour and probable future behaviour. The calculation of these score values through Klarna is carried out on the basis of a scientifically acknowledged mathematical statistical method. Therefore, Klarna will use your address data, amongst other things. If the result of the calculation is that you are not creditworthy, Klara will inform you immediately.

 **Revocation of use of personal data towards Klarna**

1\. You may revoke your consent to the use of your personal data towards Klarna at any time. However, Klarna may be entitled to collect, use and disclose your personal data inasmuch as this is necessary for the contractual handling of payments through Klarna's services, required by law, or demanded by a court or authority.

2\. Of course, you can obtain information about the stored personal data at any time. This right is guaranteed by the German Data Protection Act. If this is what you want as a buyer or if you want to inform Klarna about changes regarding the stored data, you can contact datenschutz@klarna.de.
