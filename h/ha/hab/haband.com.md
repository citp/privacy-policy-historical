More details of the ways in which we may use your information are set out below.

 **E-mails.** We may use your e-mail address to notify you about the status of your order (if you have placed one), provide customer service information, or answer your questions and requests. We may also occasionally send you our e-mail updates, sales notifications, or other promotional information about our products and services or about the products and services of our affiliated companies or trusted third party partners in which you may be interested. We may also share your e-mail address with our affiliated companies to enable them to send you emails directly regarding their products and services, sales and other promotions.

 **Telephone Contact.** If you provide us with your phone number, you may receive telephone contact from us for customer service communications, such as to ask you about your order, if you have placed one. If you call our customer service toll-free number, we may ask you for personal identification information, depending on the nature of your request, to better assist you with your requests and questions. We may retain this information to help meet your future needs.

We may occasionally use your phone number to contact you with updates, sales notifications, or other promotional information about our products and services or those of our affiliated companies or trusted third party partners in which you may be interested. We may also make your personal information available to our affiliated companies and our other trusted third party partners to enable them to contact you directly with their promotional information, such as information about their products and services, sales and other promotions.

 **Contests, Promotions, or Surveys.** If you participate in a contest, promotion, sweepstakes offering, or survey (whether online, over the phone, by mail, or at one of our retail stores), we may use your personal information to manage your entry in such promotion, to notify you if you are a winner, or to fulfill promotional obligations. At the time of your entry or registration for a specific promotion, survey, contest, or sweepstakes, we will provide you with the rules governing such promotion, survey, contest, or sweepstakes.

 **Authorized Third Parties.** There is a link on our "Thank You" page that directs customers to another web site. This web site makes an offer of rebates and discounts for a monthly subscription fee. If you follow the link and only if you accept the offer, Haband will transfer your name, street address and credit card information to the operators of that web site so that they can fulfill the subscription and charge your card. This web site requires your explicit consent to transfer your information if you choose to accept their offer. If any customer follows the link, but does not accept the offer, no personal or credit card information will be transferred.

We have also contracted with some third parties to monitor certain pages of our web site for the purpose of reporting web site traffic, as well as to serve offers and advertisements that may be of interest to you. Where authorized by us, these third parties may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile information about our web site visitors. No personally identifiable information is shared directly with the marketing partner. We utilize a third-party service to ensure the data we share with the marketing partner contains no personally identifiable information. For more information about how the information is collected and used, or to opt-out from receiving advertisements, please see their privacy policies at:

 **Catalogs and Mailings.** We may use your name and postal address to occasionally send you our printed catalogs, magalogs, valpaks or other syndicated mailings, as well as materials regarding offerings of our affiliated companies and our other trusted third party partners. We may also make your name, postal address and transactional information available to our affiliated companies and our other trusted third party partners so that you may receive mailings directly from them about products and services that may be of interest to you.

 **Financial Products.** Haband offers the private label Haband Credit Card, which is issued by World Financial Capital Bank (WFCB). As a result, we may share personal information about our consumers with WFCB and other authorized third parties to provide you with tailored information about their special offers and services. These parties have separate privacy and data collection practices. We recommend that you review each third party's privacy statement if you submit your application for its services.

 **By Law.** In certain instances, we may disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify or contact you in relation to, or bring legal action to protect, your legal rights, the legal rights of us and/or of our affiliated companies, or the legal rights of others. We may also disclose your personal information when we believe it is required by law.

 **Sale of Business.** In the event that the Orchard Brands Company, any of its affiliated companies, or any part of any of them, is sold, or some or all of their assets are acquired, customer information may be among the transferred assets, and may therefore be used by the third party acquirer.

 **How can you control the use of your information?**

We want you to be in control of your information, and we want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.

 **Account Management.** You can contact us at any time to review, change or delete certain personal information. Simply call our customer service specialists at 800-742-2263.

 **E-mails.** If you do not want to receive our electronic newsletter or promotional e-mails, you may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on "unsubscribe" at the bottom of any of our promotional e-mails.

 **Catalogs.** If you do not wish to receive our printed catalog, please contact our customer service specialists at 800-742-2263. When you give us your name and address as it appears on the mailing label, we will remove your contact information from our mailing list. Please allow several weeks for the catalogs to stop, as catalog delivery is scheduled well in advance.

 **Telephone Contact.** If you do not wish to receive telephone calls from us regarding our sales notifications or promotions, please contact our customer service specialists at 800-742-2263. Please note that we may continue to contact you by telephone for customer service communications (such as in relation to orders that you have previously placed with us).

 **Sharing Information with Third Parties.** If you would rather that we did not share your personal information with our affiliated companies or our third party partners for their direct marketing purposes, please send your full name, address and customer number to our mailing address listed at the end of this privacy policy. Please note that even if you opt out of having your information shared with third parties in this way, we may still disclose your information to third parties in other circumstances as described in this privacy policy, for example, where required to enable our third party service providers to provide services to us, and where required by law.

Please also note that where we have previously disclosed personal information to an affiliated company or third party partner prior to your opting out, that company's use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy. If you want to change how information is used by an affiliate company or third party (for example, by opting-out of receiving emails or telephone communications from that company), you must contact that company or party directly. We cannot alter or remove your information from any of our affiliated companies' or third party partners' databases.

 **How do we safeguard your information?**

Protecting the safety of your personal information is important to us. Where we maintain an online store, we use a variety of technical, administrative and physical safeguards so that you can enjoy your shopping experience without having to worry about the loss of, misuse of, or unauthorized access to your information.

 **Secure Shopping.** Where our Site permits you to enter credit card or other billing information, we use industry-standard encryption technologies to encrypt that information while it is being transmitted to our Site. In addition, we make commercially acceptable efforts to stay up to date with best practices regarding the protection of information in connection with transactions occurring over the internet. We also use GeoTrust, Inc. as our SSL provider as an added measure for your protection. You may want to check your internet settings to make sure your browser is in compliance with industry-standard encryption technology.

 **Firewalls.** We protect all personal information stored in our computer systems, including information about your orders, behind a network security system called a "firewall." We only permit our authorized staff and authorized third party service providers to access our computer systems, and then only for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

 **Phone Orders.** Some versions of popular web browsers and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders. If your web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Site or those of our affiliated companies. If so, you may place orders by calling us toll-free at 800-742-2263.

We follow industry practices to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, but no data transmission over Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet. Also, please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.

 **Conflict in Terms**

It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read privacy policy with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our privacy policy into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary"; it is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the privacy policy upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our privacy policy. For this reason, you should rely on our privacy policy as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.

One or more patents may apply to this Site or those of our affiliated brands, including without limitation, U.S. Patent #5,528,490; #5,761,649; and #6,029,142.
