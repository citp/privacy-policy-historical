 **How do we use your information?**

Haband wants to provide you with the most efficient and trustworthy shopping experience. We may use personal information that you provide to us in the following manner:

  * To assist you in customer service communications;
  * To administer "My Account" information, online forms, and other site features;
  * To enable you to checkout and purchase;
  * To send you special announcements or promotional information about new products or services and upcoming events;
  * To send you printed direct mail offers and catalogs in the mail; or
  * As necessary, to share your information with trusted third-party companies that provide support services.



 **In-store Shopping.** When you visit our store, you can shop anonymously when you pay with cash. However, we may keep a history of your purchases if you use a credit card or debit card. We collect this information in order to process your orders to better assist you, and all such information will be treated in compliance with this Privacy Statement.

If you want to return or exchange purchased merchandise, we may ask you for personal identifying information such as the credit card used for the purchase or a picture ID to help prevent fraud.

 **Customer Service.** When you place a telephone or online order with us, we ask that you provide us with your phone number. While we may contact you to ask you to provide us information necessary to fill your order, it is not our policy to make outbound sales calls.

If you call our customer service toll-free number, we may ask you personal identifying information, depending on the nature of your request, to better assist you with your requests and questions. We may retain this information to help meet your future needs.

 **Direct Mailings.** We may use your name and postal address to occasionally send you printed mailings from Haband. We may also share such information, as described herein, with our affiliated-companies or to other reputable direct marketing companies who may have offers of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive offers from non-affiliated third parties via direct mail, please send an e-mail to [service@haband.net](mailto:service@haband.net) with the subject line "Do Not Rent." Please include in the body of the e-mail the name and land address that you wish to have excluded from this list.

 **E-mails.** We may use your e-mail address to occasionally send you information on new product offerings, sales promotions and web-only special offers. We will not sell or rent your e-mail address to outside marketing companies.

You will also be automatically eligible to and may receive similar promotional information via e-mail from our affiliated companies and brands regarding their special announcements such as information about that brand's products and services, sales and other promotions. Please note that any use of personal information by an affiliated company will be governed by that entity's privacy policy. If you want to change how information is used on that company's website, you must do so directly with that company.

 **Contests, Promotions or Surveys.** If you participate in a contest, promotion, sweepstakes offering or survey (whether via on-line, over the phone or at one of our retail stores), we may use your personal information to manage your entry in such promotion, to notify you if you are a winner, or to fulfill promotional obligations. At the time of your entry or registration for a specific promotion, survey, contest, or sweepstakes, we will provide you with the rules governing such promotion, contest or survey.

 **Authorized Third Parties.** There is a link on our "Thank You" page that directs customers to another web site. This web site makes an offer of rebates and discounts for a monthly subscription fee. If you follow the link and only if you accept the offer, Haband will transfer your name, street address and credit card information to the operators of that web site so that they can fulfill the subscription and charge your card. This web site requires your explicit consent to transfer your information if you choose to accept their offer. If any customer follows the link, but does not accept the offer, no personal or credit card information will be transferred. If you wish to review this web site's privacy policy, you can do so at:

<http://www.reservationrewards.com/features/default.asp?pg=privacy>

We have also contracted with a third party to monitor certain pages of our web site for the purpose of reporting web site traffic, and other advertising statistics. Where authorized by us, this third party may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our web site visitors. No personally identifiable information is transferred to this third party. For more information about how the information is collected and used, please see the privacy policy at:

<http://www.imiclk.com/privacy.html>.

 **Affiliate-Company Catalogs.** If you order a product or request a catalog from us, we may make your name, postal address and transactional information available to companies within our family of affiliated companies so that you may receive future catalog offerings about products and services that may be of interest to you.

 **By Law.** In certain instances, we may disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action to protect your rights, the rights of Haband, or others. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe it is required by law.

 **Sale of Business.** In the unlikely event that Haband is sold, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets, and may therefore be used by a third party acquirer in accordance.

 **How can you control the use of your information?**

We want you to be in control of your information, and we want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.

 **Account Management.** Customers that set up an account at our web site are able to change or delete certain personal information. These customers can also track the status of current orders or view their order history with us.

 **E-mails and Newsletter.** If you do not want to receive our electronic newsletter or promotional emails, you may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the e-mail.

Please note that if you would like to opt-out of any email communications from any of our affiliated companies, you must do so directly with that company. Any use of personal information by an affiliated company will be governed by that entity's privacy policy. We cannot directly remove your information from any of our affiliated companies' email lists.

 **Direct Mailings.** If you do not wish to receive our direct mail promotions, please send an e-mail to [service@haband.net](mailto:service@haband.net) with "Do Not Mail" in the subject field. Please include your name and the land address that you would like excluded from these direct mail promotions. Please allow several weeks for the mailings to stop, as we schedule and print our mailings well in advance. If you receive a catalog from a third party or an affiliated company, please contact that company directly to make any changes. We cannot alter or remove your information from any of our affiliated companies' or third parties' mailing lists.

 **How do we safeguard your information?**

Protecting the safety of your personal information, such as your credit card information, is important to us. Our online store includes a variety of technical, administrative and physical safeguards so that you can enjoy your shopping experience without having to worry about loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to your information. For example, we have the following security measures on our websites:

 **Secure Shopping.** We use industry-standard encryption technologies to encrypt credit card and billing information while it is being transmitted to Haband. In addition, we use commercially reasonable efforts to stay up to date with best practices regarding the protection of information in connection with transactions occurring over the internet. We also use GeoTrust, Inc. as our SSL provider as an added measure for your protection. You may want to check your internet settings to make sure your browser is in compliance with industry-standard encryption technology.

 **Firewalls.** After your order is received, we protect all of your private information, including your order, behind a network security system called a "firewall." Only select staff has access to this information, and then only to information necessary to service your order.

 **Phone Orders.** Some versions of popular web browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders. If your web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our websites. If so, please phone us toll-free at 1-800-742-2263 to place your order by telephone.

We strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, but no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet. Also, please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.

 **What technologies do you use to enhance my shopping experience?**

To improve our websites and to make your online shopping experience more enjoyable, we collect anonymous information of all visitors to our websites through the use of cookies, graphic tags, transactions and other technologies.

 **Cookies.** Cookies are used for the express purpose of making your visits more worthwhile, and do not contain any personally identifying information (such as name or credit card information). Most browsers are preset to accept cookies and are used to make online shopping easier and faster for you. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, purchasing is not possible at the Haband.com site. In such cases, to place orders, you may call us at 1-800-742-2263.

 **Image Tags.** Our websites may also use analytics technology to optimize and tailor our websites for our visitors. This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our websites.

 **Third Party Links.** Our websites may include links to other websites which might take you away from our site, such as sites of outside business partners, vendors and advertisers. These sites have separate privacy and data collection practices. Haband Online has no control over such websites and is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or information-gathering practices of other entities or web sites. Except as stated in this Privacy Statement, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your prior consent.

 **Conflict in Terms**

It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Statement with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Statement into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary". It is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Statement upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our Privacy Statement. For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.
