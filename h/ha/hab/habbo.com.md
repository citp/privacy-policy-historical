Sulake gathers user information to provide you with a customized experience on our sites. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, if you are 13 or older we will ask you to provide personal information when you first sign-up and create your Habbo, visit certain areas of Habbo Hotel™, or engage in activities (e.g. download software, enter a contest, order products, or subscribe to a newsletter). If you choose not to register, you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.

E-mail:  
If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from time to time, we may e-mail you with informative messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the email was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information to other information we have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you.

For such forms, we collect a user's contact information (e.g., e-mail address and in the case of delivery of tangible products, delivery address and phone number) and necessary information to process the order (e.g., credit card number and billing address).
