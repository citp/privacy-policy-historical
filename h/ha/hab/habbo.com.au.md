Nothing in this Privacy Policy will create or add to any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against us or a Sulake Australia Affiliate; nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose any obligations or liability upon us or a Sulake Australia Affiliate, or add to any obligation or liability, that we or a Sulake Australia Affiliate does not already otherwise have to any individual or person at law or in equity or otherwise.
