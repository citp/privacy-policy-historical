By clicking the 'Accept' button when you register you are agreeing to us holding and processing your personal information.

If you are under 16 you should check with your parents or guardians that they are happy for you to be a member of Habbo. Please get them to explain any areas of this statement you may not fully understand.

If you have any concerns regarding your personal information, website content, or any queries with regard to Habbo's practices please contact us using the "Contact Us (Help Tool)" link at the bottom of this page.

If your children disclose information about themselves in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, it is up to you to ensure they abide by our [Terms of Service](http://www.habbo.co.uk/papers/termsAndConditions).

 **Cookies:** A cookie is a small piece of information sent by web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser.
