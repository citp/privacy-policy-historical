# Habbo ~ Privacy Policy

Here at Habbo Hotel we want everyone to have a good time. Also, we promise to keep your hotel as secure and as private as we can. The hotel is a place for you to hang out in and meet new people. We have a few [rules](https://web.archive.org/help/habbo_way.html) that you do need to accept before you can become a member, so you need to read the Privacy Policy all the way through before you can join. 

By clicking the 'accept' button when you register, you will be agreeing to us holding and processing your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

If you are under 14 we think you should check with your parents or guardians to see if they are happy for you to be a member of Habbo Hotel. Please get them to explain any areas of this statement you may not fully understand. 

If you have any concerns regarding your personal information, website content, or any queries with regard to Habbo Hotel practices please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us.html).
