<p>Here at Habbo Hotel we want everyone to have a good time, and we promise to try to keep your hotel as secure and as private as we can. The hotel is a place for you to hang out in and meet new people. We have a few rules that you do need to accept before you can become a member, and you need to read this Privacy Policy and the rest of our Terms and Conditions all the way through before you can join. Terms not defined here are defined in our Terms and Conditions. The owners of Habbo Hotel, Sulake Canada Inc. (“Habbo Canada” or “we” or “us”), and its parent company and affiliated companies (collectively, “Habbo Affiliates”) are committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with this Privacy Policy. <b>By clicking the 'accept' button when you register you are agreeing to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</b></p> 

<p>If you are under 13 years old, you must check with your parents or guardians before you agree to this Privacy Policy and to ensure that they agree that you can visit Habbo Hotel. Please have them explain anything in this Privacy Policy that you may not fully understand.</p> 

<p><b>YOUR CONSENT</b><br>
By using our Website and submitting any personal information to Habbo Canada or any Habbo Affiliate, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. </p> 

<p><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
”Personal information” is information about you that allows you to be identified, such as your name, home address, age, telephone number, credit card number or other payment information, and the items you purchase from the Website. Personal information does not include aggregate information about a group of people where individuals cannot be identified. 
You may submit personal information to us when you visit our Website. Information is collected through your interaction with us, including your completion of online forms (such as the registration form), your participation in contests and surveys, your subscription for certain newsletters and Enhanced Services, your posting of messages to the Message Boards and Chat Services, and your emails or other communications with us.
We also collect “cookie” information automatically about your visit to our Website. 
<br>A cookie is a small piece of information sent by web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser about your computer, but not about you. We use cookies to identify your computer when your computer is used to visit us and to keep track of which webpages and websites you visit so we can build up a demographic profile and learn about what your preferences are. Our use of cookies also allows you to be presented with a personalised version of the Website and promotional information, and to enable you to access your account.
</p> 

<p><b>PURPOSES OF COLLECTION</b><br>
We may collect, use and disclose your personal information for the purposes of:</p> 

<ul><li>Understanding your needs and improving our offering of information, products and services to you, such as special discounts and deals.<br> 
</li><li>Enabling you to send your Habbo Friends emails and SMS without them knowing your contact details..<br> 
</li><li>Administering your account with us, such as collecting payments and monitoring your credit status, and managing invoicing, accounting and information security services related to our relationship with you.<br> 
</li><li>Managing the provision of goods, services and privileges to you.<br> 
</li><li>Upon your request, to distribute newsletters and other information about the Website, Habbo Canada and Habbo Affiliates, in any format or media, including via third parties.<br>

</li><li>Maintaining information as a reference tool or general resource to help us to understand trends and visitor needs.<br>
</li><li>Providing you with personalised information about products and services of Habbo Canada, Habbo Affiliates, and third parties with whom we do business. <br>

</li><li>As permitted by, and to comply with, applicable laws and regulations.  <br></li><li>Any other purposes to which you consent.
 </li></ul>

<p><b>DISCLOSURES</b><br>
We will not disclose, sell, share, or rent your information to others except as set out in this Privacy Policy. Personal information we collect may be shared with Habbo Affiliates, business partners, purchasers of our business, suppliers and service providers we engage, but only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or to which you otherwise consent. When we provide personal information to a third party, we use contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection and limit their use of such information to the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. </p> 
<p>In addition to the purposes described above in “Purposes of Collection and Use”, from time to time, Habbo Canada may disclose your personal information to:</p> 
<ul><li>prospective purchasers, investors, professional advisors, and other third parties engaged in a prospective or actual sale, merger, acquisition, financing or other corporate business transaction involving Habbo Canada (or a Habbo Affiliate) or its assets.<br>

</li><li>credit bureaus and credit reporting agencies.<br>
</li><li>a person who, in the reasonable judgment of Habbo Canada, is providing or seeking information as your agent (such as your parent or guardian).<br>

<p><b>CHAT SERVICES AND MESSAGE BOARDS</b><br>
We make chat facilities and message boards available to you. Please remember that any information you choose to disclose in these areas may become public information. We would encourage you to exercise caution when deciding to disclose information, and be careful what you reveal to people you don't yet know. Please refer to our <a href="/footer_pages/terms_and_conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p> 

<p><b>OPTING-OUT – WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT</b></p>
<p>While there is certain personal information that we require from you in order to provide you with all of the features, products and services of the Website, under most circumstances you may withdraw your consent to our use and disclosure of information for certain purposes. For example, if you do not wish to receive the hotel's newsletter, or information about products and services supplied by Habbo Canada or Habbo Affiliates or third parties, do not check the boxes at the bottom of the registration form. You may change these options anytime by selecting the 'Update your Habbo ID' link on our home page. Alternatively, you may opt-out by emailing us or contacting our Privacy Officer at the contact information at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE OR CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
To ensure that the personal information that you provided to us is accurate, complete and up to date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used, we rely on you to provide us with updates and to inform us of any errors by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.habbohotel.ca/iot/go?lang=en_CA&amp;country=ca">emailing us</a>. 

</p><p><b>SECURITY</b><br>
We protect your personal information with appropriate security safeguards, including physical, organizational and technological measures designed to protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. All personal information you provide us with on the Website, and all personal information contained in your account, is encrypted. This coding lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. Transactions will not be permitted if your browser does not accept the encryption. Only authorised personnel of Habbo Canada and Habbo Affiliates or their partners can decode this information and such personnel will only do so in accordance with our, or their, privacy policy. </p>
Please note that unlike your communications with the Website, we have no control over the privacy of your e-mail messages with us. We recommend that you do not include personal information in e-mails, including your visitor name and account password. We are not responsible for any loss or damage if you send us personal information by e-mail.
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHILDREN</b><br>
Habbo Hotel is not intended for use by children, especially those under the age of 13. No one under the age of 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or to use our public discussion areas without parental consent.</p> 

<p>If your children disclose information about themselves to our Website or in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, it is up to you to ensure they abide by our  <a href="/footer_pages/terms_and_conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>, caution them not to share personal information, and to monitor their use of the Website. If you're worried about your children's activities or their privacy on our Website, we encourage you to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.habbo.ca/iot/go?lang=en_CA&amp;country=ca">email us.</a></p> 

<p><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
<p>Habbo Canada reserves the right, at any time, and from time to time, to modify this Privacy Policy, and you agree to be bound by such modifications. However, any changes or additions to the purposes for which we collect, use or disclose your personal information will not apply to you unless you consent to them or unless otherwise permitted by law. Changes to this Privacy Policy shall be effective immediately upon providing you with notice, which notice may be given by any means, including without limitation, by posting the change on the Website or by electronic or conventional mail. You agree to regularly review the Privacy Policy. Your use of the Website following the posting of any change (other than changes to the purposes for which we collect, use or disclose your personal information) shall constitute your agreement to the modified Privacy Policy. If at any time the modified Privacy Policy is no longer acceptable to you, you should not use this Website. </p>
<p><b>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</b></p>
<p>Please be aware our Website may have advertisements and links to third party websites and services that may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices and policies of these other third parties, and we cannot control the practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read the policies of all websites you use, as their policies and practices may be very different from ours.</p>
<p><b>APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Habbo Canada. Nothing in this Privacy Policy will create or add to any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against Habbo Canada or a Habbo Affiliate; nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose any obligations or liability upon Habbo Canada or a Habbo Affiliate, or add to any obligation or liability, that Habbo Canada or a Habbo Affiliate does not already otherwise have to any individual or person at law or in equity or otherwise.</p>
<p><b>QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS</b></p>
<p>We have appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws. If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, or if you simply want to know whether we have any of your personal information on file, please contact our Privacy Officer at:<br>
