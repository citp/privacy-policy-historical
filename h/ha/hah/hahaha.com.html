        <p>It’s true. The Just For Laughs Festival is celebrating it’s 30th anniversary this year. And while it’s an honour to be the centre of the comedy universe for 3 decades and counting, it’s a much bigger honour to be the same age as award-winning actress, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Scott_%28actress%29" target="_blank">Hillary Scott</a>.</p>
