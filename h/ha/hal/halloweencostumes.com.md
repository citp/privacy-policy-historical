# Privacy Policy at Spirit Halloween

## What This Privacy Policy Covers

  * This policy covers how Spirit Halloween Superstores LLC (“Spirit”) treats personal information that Spirit collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Spirit products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. 
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Spirit does not own or control, or to people that Spirit does not employ or manage. 



## Information Collection and Use

_General_

  * Spirit collects personal information when you register with Spirit and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes. Spirit may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 
  * When you register for Spirit, we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. When you register with Spirit and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
  * Spirit collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer. 
  * Spirit uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. 



_Children_

On the sites specifically designed for children, Spirit requires children to consult with their parents before furnishing data. However, Spirit believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that may help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools may also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. Personal information about or obtained from a child will not be used for commercial or trade purposes without the prior written consent of a parent or legal guardian of the child. Information Sharing and Disclosure 

  * Spirit does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 
    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Spirit under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Spirit communicate with you about offers from Spirit and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
    * We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing Spirit to collect and use their child's information without consenting to Spirit sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes. 
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Spirit terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
    * We transfer information about you if Spirit is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Spirit will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 



## Confidentiality and Security 

  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 
  * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 



## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Spirit may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to your email address.
