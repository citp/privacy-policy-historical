By accessing and/or using the Websites, you agree that both your access to and use of the Websites are governed by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use located at [www.hallmarkchannel.com/crown-media-family-networks-terms-of-use](https://web.archive.org/crown-media-family-networks-terms-of-use) (collectively, the “Privacy Policy”), as well as all applicable laws, rules and regulations and rules governing promotions. 

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**  
We collect personally identifiable information (such as, your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, cable/satellite provider, birth date or gender), when it is voluntarily submitted by users in connection with newsletters, sweepstakes, contests, feedback, registrations, surveys, memberships, products or services. **Please note that participation in some activities offered on our Websites may be limited without the submission of personally identifiable information of the user.**

We collect aggregate information about your activities on our Websites (such as, pages at the Website which you access most frequently, what browser version you are using, what browser plug-ins you have installed, etc.). This allows us to improve our Websites based on current technology demographics so that we may provide you with the best online experience at the Websites. The only time we ever receive personal information from you is when you volunteer the information. The personal information we receive from a user-submitted entry for a specific sweepstakes, contest, registration, survey, product or service may be shared with that sweepstakes, contest, registration, survey, product or service's third-party promotional partners if the user has given us permission to do so. Users may elect not to participate by clicking the appropriate on-screen checkbox before submitting any information. Subscribers of our email newsletter can easily unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions located at the bottom of every one of our e-mail newsletters. Additionally, you may also unsubscribe by modifying their “Edit My Profile” link on the Websites (if a profile setting is available) after logging in.
