We use this customer contact information to send information to our registered users about the services for which they have subscribed. We use the financial information collected to verify the user's identity and to bill the user for products and services. 

**Cookies:**

We use your IP (Internet Provider) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. We use IP addresses to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Data Sharing:**  
We do not give out, sell or rent registered user address or credit card information without consent except where a) we have your consent b) We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf c) when we need to deliver a product or service that a registered user has ordered or d) to comply with valid legal process.

We send all registered users on our Auction ecommerce platform (i.e. NeoFillBids.com and BidDestination.com) an email confirming their registration.  We also send site and service announcement updates that contain important information about the services on our website. In addition, our Customer Support Department may, as the individual situation warrants, communicate with users via telephone or email to provide them with services they have requested or to follow-up on issues relating to their account.

When a user registers as a user of NeoFill®, the user agrees to receive communications from NeoFill®. We do not sell, rent or otherwise provide our registered users email addresses to third parties, unless the third party is affiliated with a promotional offer (i.e. Merchant, Media Partner). However we occasionally send emails to our registered users informing them of our new products and services or special promotions. Users who do not wish to receive this correspondence may unsubscribe from receiving such information at any time
