## Disclosure of Your Personal Information

We may disclose your information to our staff and to third parties involved in the completion of your transaction, the delivery of your order, and the analysis and support of your use of the Site. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information if necessary to protect our legal rights, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct, or we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on us or (2) to protect and defend our property or other rights, the users of the Site or the public.

## Use of Cookies

Cookies are very tiny text files that are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to provide you with the best level of service by keeping track of what you have in your shopping cart, remembering you when you return to our store and using them to help us show you advertisements which are relevant to your interests. They cannot harm your computer and they do not contain any personal or private information. You must accept cookies to shop through the Site. You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but the Site may not work correctly or at all if you set your browser not to accept cookies.

## Information Protection

We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and encryption technology that works with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and AOL's browser, with the objective that only we can read a customer's personal information. We employ physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of any personal contact information. We comply with the EU GDPR framework as set forth by the European Union regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries. We adhere to the requirements of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.

## Information Storage Time

We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it (for instance for taxation or insurance purposes or in case orders may give rise to claims). We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely, and you should consult that forum’s separate privacy policy.

## Third Party Websites

This Site may contain links to third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites even if they are accessed using links from our Site. Your use of these third-party websites is entirely at your own risk and we recommend that you check the privacy and security policy of each site you visit. When you click on a third-party link, you are essentially taken to a third party’s website. We make no representation or warranty as to the effectiveness, quality, legitimacy or data protections of any third-party website.

## Product Information and Service Offerings

It is very important to us that we provide you with the highest level of service. In order to help us do this, from time to time we may send you details of products and services which we think may be of interest to you. We may send you marketing communications with your consent. If at any time you do not wish to receive these details and wish to unsubscribe from marketing communications, you may do so by accessing your account through the My Account link located at the top of each page on the Site.

## Surveys or Contests

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Therefore, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (name, address, email address, and/or phone number). We may request other information, in our sole discretion, which we consider important to the administration of the survey or contest.

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, monitor site traffic, personalize the site, and send participants an email newsletter. We may also use this information for publicity or marketing purposes. We may publish this information in our sole discretion. The rules applicable to any individual survey or contest will be published prior to the collection of any personally identifiable information and you agree to such use by submitting any information.

We may also use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. However, that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
