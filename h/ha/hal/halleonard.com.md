# Hal Leonard Online - Privacy Policy

## HAL LEONARD ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY

This privacy policy relates to the website of Hal Leonard at [www.halleonard.com](http://www.halleonard.com/).

Hal Leonard respects your right to privacy and is committed to respecting your wishes. On our site, you'll have opportunities to provide your name, address, e-mail and other relevant information to receive a more personalized visit to our site, and to share special promotions. We update this policy from time to time, so please check back.

### Information We Collect and How It's Used

### Aggregate Information

We collect aggregate information on visits made to our pages. When you visit our website, our web server recognizes only your domain name, but not your e-mail address. This means that we can track visits to our site, while visitors remain anonymous. Non-personal information is collected, such as how many consumers visit the site, what pages are accessed and which browsers or operating systems are used. We also track which websites refer visitors to the Hal Leonard site. This information helps us improve the content of our site.

### Cookies

Cookies are pieces of data your web browser stores on your hard drive. We use cookies to create your shopping list. Cookies allow you to make a list of products that interest you, and retrieve it again on subsequent visits to the site.

Most browsers accept cookies. However, if you wish, you can usually set them to refuse cookies. Hal Leonard does not use cookies to gather any personal information.

### Information We Collect on Shopping Pages

We may also use information to e-mail you about products or services which we believe may be of interest to you, including updates and special features on our website. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by using the e-mail or postal address below.

We may also use this information to send you printed catalogs or other material through the mail relating to our products. If you do not wish to receive mail at your postal address, again, please let us know.

From time to time we may share our mailing lists with reputable third parties who may also send you information about their products or services that may be of interest to you. You can, however, have your name put on our "do-not-share" list by sending an e-mail to us. Please provide us with your exact name, postal address and e-mail address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.

### Security

We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) on areas of the site where you are entering personal or payment information. This means that this information is encrypted between your computer and ours, and no one else can normally decipher it. Our encryption is the strongest commercially available - 128K - and is approved by the authorities and financial institutions.

Additionally, an independent, trusted third party - in this case GeoTrust - has issued us with a certificate which proves our right to use the domain name [halleonard.com](http://www.halleonard.com/) in a secure environment, and who can clarify that we are who we say we are

In the event that Hal Leonard is ever bought, sold, or merged with another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of our collected information along with the rest of the assets of the company to the new owner.
