# Halfords Advice Centre - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy 

Halfords is registered under the Data Protection Act. We are committed to protecting your privacy and have taken steps to explain this in full below. We use the information we collect to enhance and improve your experience of using our websites. We do not disclose your information to anyone outside of Halfords unless we receive your permission to do so. We explain here, for your reassurance, why we ask for information and how this information is likely to be used. You can then make informed choices about the information you provide on the Halfords websites. 

### 1\. About Halfords: where your information goes – and where it does not go 

When you give us information on any Halfords website, it may be analysed and used occasionally by Halfords. We will only disclose information to any other third parties if a) we have your express permission to do so where such information is personal, or b) it is in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of Halfords assets or stock by way of merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise, or c) it is in connection with our use of Cookies as explained in paragraph 4 below. The usage of this information is listed below. 

### 2\. Your personal information – what it's used for 

a) To enable us to provide you with marketing and customer services: If you have requested extra services such as ordering a catalogue we ask for your contact details, such as your e-mail or your home address. We can then tell you about new products and services that we think will be of interest to you, or to sort out any queries you may have about using the sites. We aim to keep our contact with you to an acceptable level. You will only ever receive information from Halfords unless you have given us your permission to pass on your details to external third parties. 

b) To provide an improved service: There is more detailed information that we ask for and it is optional that you provide it. This information allows us to update and improve the contents of our sites. 

c) To learn about what our customers want: In addition, the extra information we ask for helps us to understand more about the kinds of people who benefit most from using our websites. We think it's important to understand our customers well enough to keep improving our service for them. 

d) To tell you about products and services we think you'll like: We also learn about our customers by tracking their movements around the sites. Individuals are not identified, but the results of customers' preferences and their use of the sites are analysed en masse. Certain groups of people may be sent further information about products and services, based on that analysis. You have a right not to receive this information ndash; see more information in point 3 below. 

e) Where we use other companies to assist in the processing of your order (e.g. packing and delivering of orders, processing credit/debit card transactions, fraud prevention) we may pass sufficient information to these companies to allow them to provide the service we have requested. The companies concerned are not permitted to use the information supplied for any other purpose. 

### 3\. If you do not wish to receive information from Halfords
