6.9. We shall have no liability for any delay in delivery of the Goods, or failure to deliver the Goods, where the delay or failure is caused either by an Event Outside Our Control or the Customer's failure to provide us with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of the Goods.

6.10 If we miss our estimated delivery deadline for the Goods or, in the absence of any estimate being given the date 30 days after the Dispatch Confirmation, you may cancel your Order straight away if any of the following apply:

After you cancel your Order we will refund any sums you have paid to us for the cancelled Goods and their delivery.

### 7 . Refunds and Returns

7.1 Refunds and returns of Goods purchased from an Approved Partner must be arranged directly with that Approved Partner, in accordance with the process set out on its 'About Us' page in the Marketplace. The rest of this clause 7 relates to refunds and returns of Halfords Goods only. Advice about your legal right to cancel the Contract is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. 

7.2 If you are a consumer, you have a legal right to cancel a Contract under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 within 14 days of receipt of Goods however for Halfords Goods, Halfords have extended that right to 28 days from receipt of the Goods (please see clause 7.4 below for an explanation of the period during which you can cancel a Contract). This means that during the relevant period if you change your mind or decide for any other reason that you do not want to receive or keep the Goods, you can notify us of your decision to cancel the Contract and receive a refund. Alternatively, you are entitled to request an exchange within the same period of time and the provisions below also apply to exchanges.

7.3 However, this cancellation right does not apply in the case of the following which may only be returned if they are faulty:  
(a) personalised and made-to-order products;   
(b) sealed satellite navigation equipment, sealed memory cards, sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software which have been unsealed after you receive them.   
(c) any Goods which become mixed inseparably with other items after their delivery.

7.4 Your legal right to cancel a Contract starts from the date of the Dispatch Confirmation (the date on which we e-mail you to confirm our acceptance of your order), which is when the Contract between us is formed. Your deadline for cancelling the Contract then depends on what you have ordered and how it is delivered, as set out in the table below:

Your Contract | End of the cancellation period  
---|---  
Your Contract is for Goods which are not delivered in instalments on separate days. | The end date is the end of 28 days after the day on which you receive the Goods. Example: if we provide you with a Dispatch Confirmation on 1 January and you receive the Goods on 10 January you may cancel at any time between 1 January and the end of the day on 7 February.  
Your Contract is for Goods which are delivered in instalments on separate days. | The end date is 28 days after the day on which you receive the last instalment of the Goods or the last of the separate Goods ordered.  
Example: if we provide you with a Dispatch Confirmation on 1 January and you receive the first instalment of your Goods on 10 January and the last instalment or last separate item of your Goods on 15 January you may cancel in respect of all instalments and any or all of the separate Goods at any time between 1 January and the end of the day on 12 February.  
Your Contract is for the regular delivery of Goods over a set period. | The end date is 28 days after the day on which you receive the first delivery of the Goods.  
Example: if we provide you with a Dispatch Confirmation on 1 January in respect of Goods to be delivered at regular intervals over a year and you receive the first delivery of your Goods on 10 January, you may cancel at any time between 1 January and the end of the day on 7 February. 7 February is the last day of the cancellation period in respect of all Goods to arrive during the year.  
  
7.5 To cancel a Contract with Halfords, you need to let us know that you have decided to cancel. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact the Halfords Customer Services Team, by phone, email or letter sent by post or using the online form on our Website. If you use the online form we will e-mail you to confirm we have received your cancellation. If you are e-mailing us or writing to us please include details of your Order to help us to identify it. If you send us your cancellation notice by e-mail or by post, then your cancellation is effective from the date you send us the e-mail or post the letter to us. For example, you will have given us notice in time as long as you get your letter into the last post on the last day of the cancellation period or e-mail us before midnight on that day.

7.6 If you cancel your Contract with Halfords, Halfords will:  
(a) refund you the price you paid for the Goods. However, please note we are permitted by law to reduce your refund to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.   
(b) refund any delivery costs you have paid.   
(c) make any refunds due to you as soon as possible and in any event within the deadlines indicated below:  
(i) if you have received the Goods and we have not offered to collect it from you: 14 days after the day on which we receive the Goods back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the Goods back to us.

(ii) if you have not received the Goods or you have received it and we have offered to collect it from you: 14 days after you inform us of your decision to cancel the Contract. 

7.7 If you have returned the Goods to us under this clause 7 because they are faulty or mis-described, we will refund the price of the Goods in full, together with any applicable delivery charges. 

7.8 We will refund you on the credit card or debit card used by you to pay. If you used vouchers to pay for the Goods we may refund you in vouchers.

7.9 If Goods have been delivered to you before you decide to cancel your Contract:

(b) unless the Goods are faulty or not as described (in this case, see clause 7.7, you will be responsible for the cost of returning the Goods to us. If the Goods cannot be returned by post, we may offer to collect the Goods from you in which case we will charge you the direct cost to us of collection which will be £7.

7.10 Because you are a consumer, we are under a legal duty to supply Goods that are in conformity with this Contract.

## Chemical Regulations

Halfords supplies many chemical-based products online, via our catalogue and in-store. All retailers selling chemical products are obliged to comply with European directives by providing key health and safety information for this type of product. Several key European Directives/Regulations exist governing the supply of chemical products with regard to labelling, packaging and marketing and these regulations also require health and safety documentation to be made readily available.

The Regulations themselves are designed to protect both the environment and human health, and as a responsible supplier Halfords naturally takes its obligations very seriously and ensures it complies and enforces these regulations.

[Halfords Health and Safety information](http://www.my-sds.co.uk/default.asp?accountid=guest&languagecode=44&companyid=halfords) for chemical products provides access to the latest up-to-date label information, Safety Data Sheets and Detergent Ingredient Data sheets.

To access further information, follow the link above, then select ’Name’ for the search criteria in the left-hand drop-down box, and in the box underneath, enter either the full name of your product if know, e.g. Halfords 5W30 VW Fully Synthetic Oil, or a generic name, e.g. oil, click ’Search’, and all the products we have information on will be displayed in the box to the right. Then simply click on the rectangular symbol to display the safety data sheet, or the diamond symbol to display the chemical supply symbol. 

Should you have any queries regarding this or any other safety issues please contact our [customer services](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CSCategoryDisplay?storeId=10001&langId=-1&catalogId=21202&categoryId=292515&topCategoryId=292503) department
