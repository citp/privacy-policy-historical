# Privacy Policy - hawthornfc.com.au

Your privacy is important to the Australian Football League **(AFL)** and each of the 18 AFL Clubs listed in paragraph 13 at the end of this privacy policy **(AFL Clubs)**. This privacy statement provides information about the personal information that the AFL and AFL Clubs collect and the ways in which the AFL and AFL Clubs may use and disclose this personal information. 

The AFL may disclose your personal information to AFL Clubs, and AFL Clubs may disclose your personal information to the AFL.  Each organisation will collect and use your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where you provide your personal information directly to one AFL Club, although it may be disclosed to the AFL, that personal information will not ordinarily be shared with a different AFL Club.  However, there may be some circumstances where this personal information is shared between AFL Clubs.  For example, if in a transaction you purchase merchandise relating to two AFL Clubs, that transaction may be shared with both AFL Clubs.

**2     Accessing AFL Online**

“AFL Online” refers to the Australian Football League website with its top-level domain located at http://www.afl.com.au/, all related sub-domains and any other AFL website (including AFL Club websites) which provides an AFL and AFL Club product, AFL and AFL Club service or AFL-related product or service. You need not disclose your identity to the AFL or AFL Club in order to visit AFL Online, except where personal information is voluntarily supplied, however the AFL or AFL Club internet server may automatically record details about any computer used to access the website (such as the IP address, domain name and browser type), the date and time of access, and details of the information downloaded. This information is used for internal statistical purposes and to improve AFL Online.

The AFL or AFL Clubs may use “cookies” on AFL Online. A cookie is a small text file that AFL Online may place on your computer.

Cookies may collect and store personal information about you.

**3     AFL Privacy Policy**

This policy describes the way the AFL and AFL Clubs collect, hold and disclose personal information. Personal information is information that identifies you or could identify you. The AFL and AFL Clubs are subject to the _Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)_ , including the National Privacy Principles. The AFL may vary this policy from time to time, by posting an updated policy accessible via AFL Online. Protecting confidential information is fundamental to the AFL’s and AFL Clubs’ relationship with AFL supporters, employees and players. All information received in connection with an AFL or AFL Club product or service, or in the conduct of the AFL’s or AFL Clubs’ business, is therefore treated seriously, having regard to the AFL’s and the AFL Clubs’ legal obligations.
