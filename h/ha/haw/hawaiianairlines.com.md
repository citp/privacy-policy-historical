Your Hawaiian Airlines Membership number is unique to your account and used to identify you and your transactions for record purposes. In addition, you have a personal PIN number that serves as your personal password to your account and is designed to protect your account from unauthorized use. Hawaiian Airlines will not be responsible for any lost, stolen, or otherwise disclosed PIN numbers. Additionally, Hawaiian Airlines will not replace or reinstate any flight credits or HawaiianMiles, partner miles, or program awards that are generated or redeemed by unauthorized PIN use.

**Hawaiian Airlines and HawaiianMiles Special Offers:**   
Hawaiian Airlines may use the name and address information or the e-mail address you provide to send you special offers that we feel may be interesting and useful for you.

Hawaiian Airlines requires our Preferred Partners to ensure safeguards are always in place to protect the privacy of any information we share.
