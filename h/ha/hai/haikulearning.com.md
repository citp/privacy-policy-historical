# Privacy | Haiku LMS | The K12 learning management system

By using the haikulearning.com or myhaikuclass.com websites, a service of HAIKU Learning Systems, Inc. ("HAIKU"), you are agreeing to be bound by the following privacy policy statement. HAIKU is committed to protecting the privacy of those who visit the haikulearning.com or myhaikuclass.com website and use the haiku LMS Service. Amendments to this statement will be posted to this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any amendment, modification, or change shall constitute your acceptance of the amendment. We will notify the primary haiku LMS Service account holder by email when significant changes are made to the privacy policy. We collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information, referrals and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if HAIKU or haiku LMS is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, HAIKU will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



###  Information Gathering and Usage:

  * When you register for haiku LMS we ask for information such as your name, school, email address, billing address, and credit card information. Members who sign up for the free account are not required to enter a credit card or billing address.
  * HAIKU uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.
  * We will never ask for personal information directly from children under the age of 13.
  * Children must 13 years or older to sign up for a haiku LMS account. If a child is under the age of 13, a parent or legal guardian MUST signup for a haiku LMS account under the parent's name. Any personal information identified with the student (such as: email address, first and last name) that we collect is therefore collected from the Parent or Legal Guardian.

  * By using the haiku LMS student account, a student and/or parent has the ability to send personal information (such as first and last name, email address, and parents' names) to their teacher with a haiku LMS teacher account. This is done on a voluntary basis, and that information will not be provided to any third parties.



###  Cancellation and Termination:

  * You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The account screen provides a simple, no questions asked two-click instant cancellation process.
  * All of your Content and personal information will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation.
