## The HairLossTalk Privacy Policy

HairLossTalk is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. Should you choose to provide your Email address or any other personal information on any of the forms found on our site, you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with HairLossTalk. This means it will only be used to facilitate communication with you or resolve issues with you on that specific topic.

As you may have read on the [About Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20140620010029id_/http%3A//www.hairlosstalk.com/about.php) page, HairLossTalk is a one-person operation. Simply put, I hate spam more than you do. As a result, it has been a policy of mine since 1999 to never share any of my members or visitors email or personal information with any third party, with only one exception: our shipping warehouse. I am extremely adamant about this issue, and your privacy and security will always be 100% protected.

HairLossTalk provides personal information only to our shippers who use it to ship products to those who order from our [Online Product Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20140620010029id_/http%3A//www.hairlosstalk.com/shop/catalog/). They are prohibited from redistributing that information to anyone. 

## Six Principles of Fair Information

This statement regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information you provide online covers the six foundation principles of fair information: Awareness, Collection, Use, Sharing, Children, and Security.

Awareness: HairLossTalk provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available at the bottom of every page on the site, with exception of the Discussion Forums.

Collection: We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you fill out a form to request more information, register a profile in our Discussion Forums, register for one of our many Email notification lists, or establishing an account with us in our [Online Product Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20140620010029id_/http%3A//www.hairlosstalk.com/shop/catalog/). Personal information collected by HairLossTalk.com often is limited to e-mail address, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.

Use: All information collected is used solely for the purpose announced on the page where the form resides, and to support your relationship with HairLossTalk.com. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, and answering customer questions about products or services. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. In the event a legal issue arises, HairLossTalk.com will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on HairLossTalk.com web site; (b) Protect and defend the rights or property of HairLossTalk.com, HLT Group Inc., and its family of Web sites, and, (c) Act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of HairLossTalk.com, its affiliate Web sites, or the public.

Sharing: HairLossTalk will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others without your knowledge. Your personal information is provided to our shipping service and product affiliates who process your orders on our Online Product Center, but this is only to ensure safe delivery and billing of your products. These entities and/or business partners whom we work with, including those in the United States and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements. 

Children: HairLossTalk takes special care to protect the privacy needs of children under the age of 13 and encourages parents to be active participants in their child's online activities and interests. We abide by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirements. Our web site is not intended for children under the age of 13 typically, and we will not knowingly collect data from them.

Security: HairLossTalk is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use strong security encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.
