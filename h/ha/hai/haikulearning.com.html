			Privacy
		</h1>
		<p>By using the haikulearning.com or myhaikuclass.com websites, a service of Haiku Learning, Inc. (hereafter referred to as "Haiku Learning"), you are agreeing to be bound by the following privacy policy statement. Haiku Learning is committed to protecting the privacy of those who visit the haikulearning.com or myhaikuclass.com websites and use the Haiku Learning Service. Amendments to this statement will be posted to this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any amendment, modification, or change shall constitute your acceptance of the amendment. We will notify the primary Haiku Learning Service account holder by email when significant changes are made to the privacy policy. We collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information, referrals and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
			</li>
			<li>We transfer information about you if Haiku Learning or Haiku Learning is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Haiku Learning will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Information Gathering and Usage:
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>When you register for Haiku Learning we ask for information such as your name, school, email address, billing address, and credit card information. Members who sign up for the free account are not required to enter a credit card or billing address.
			</li>
			<li>Haiku Learning uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.
			</li>
			<li>We will never ask for personal information directly from children under the age of 13.
			</li>
			<li>Children must be 13 years or older to sign up for a Haiku Learning account. If a child is under the age of 13, a parent or legal guardian MUST signup for a Haiku Learning account under the parent's name. Any personal information identified with the student (such as: email address, first and last name) that we collect is therefore collected from the Parent or Legal Guardian.
			</li>
			<li>Personal information collected from student Haiku Learning accounts is used for the following purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, and contact.
			</li>
			<li>We will not provide personal information to third parties.
			</li>
			<li>By using the Haiku Learning student account, a student and/or parent has the ability to send personal information (such as first and last name, email address, and parents' names) to their teacher with a Haiku Learning teacher account. This is done on a voluntary basis, and that information will not be provided to any third parties.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Cancellation and Termination:
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The account screen provides a simple, no questions asked two-click instant cancellation process.
			</li>
			<li>All of your Content and personal information will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Cookies:
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.
			</li>
			<li>Cookies are required to use the Haiku Learning service.
			</li>
			<li>We use cookies to record current session information, but do not use permanent cookies. You are required to log in to your Haiku Learning account after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>

		</h3>
		<p>
			The Haiku Learning website and Service has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure the safety of your information. Although Haiku Learning owns the data storage, databases and all rights to the HAIKU application, you retain all rights to your data, and we will never sell or share your client data with any third-parties, or use your data for our own business advantage. We respect the privacy of our subscribers and the privacy of their data.
		</p>
