**What personal information do we collect and why?**  
We collect any and/or all of the following, depending on what particular form you fill out. Our surveys and contests collect your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and information about your collecting and selling habits and interests. Our free e-mail notices require only an e-mail address. Our registration for participating in online auctions collects your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and a valid credit card, eCheck or other validation method.

We automatically record your IP address, session duration, transaction data, the order and addresses of the pages you visit, and in most cases the data that you enter on those pages. We use all of this information to improve the navigation, functionality, and general service that our website provides.

**How does Heritage use your information?**  
Heritage researches our customers' usage patterns and demographics based on the information provided to us during their experiences on our Website. We do this to better understand our customers' needs and enhance our service. This information is compiled and analyzed for internal use.

Registration qualifies user as a Heritage customer and regardless of any regulation to the contrary agrees, until this consent is revoked in writing, that Heritage may from time to time contact user concerning sale and purchase opportunities available through Heritage.

**With whom does Heritage share your information?**  
All information is held in confidence by Heritage. Any information disseminated to parties external to Heritage is anonymous in nature - for example: the prices realized for a particular auction may include the price paid for a lot.

**What are cookies and how are they used?**  
The internet browser that you use to view our site allows a small file called a "cookie" to be saved on your hard drive. This cookie enables our Web server to recognize you as a first-time or repeat customer and may include information such as your User Name so that you do not have to re-enter it every time you visit. We also use cookies to provide customized and personalized services to you. Your browser does allow you to turn off or warn you about cookies from our site and from any other Websites.

**How do we ensure the protection of your personal information?**  
Heritage maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to us.

Heritage limits access to personal information about you to those employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you in order to do their jobs.

In the interest of privacy and security, we automatically expire your session when a specific period goes by without activity. Heritage takes reasonable precautions - including administrative, technical, and physical measures - to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

**Reviewing and changing your information**  
Heritage has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided.
