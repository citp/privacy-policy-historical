**_Collection and receipt of information by the Company’s websites_**

 _Information furnished to the Company’s websites on the user’s initiative_

This is the information that you knowingly furnish when registering for websites or the services provided on and/or through them. The relevant fields in which details must be entered will be expressly marked. Of course, failure to furnish the essential details requested in the “mandatory fields” means that you may not be registered for services or applications requiring registration.
