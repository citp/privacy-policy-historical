Third parties who may have access to information may include:

We recommend caution when using these features.

Legal Requests and Preventing Harm

To the extent permitted by law, we will disclose a visitor or registered user’s information to government authorities or third parties if: (i) required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order or similar request from a judicial entity having jurisdiction; (ii) we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, to protect the property or other rights of us or other users, third parties or the public at large; or (iii) we believe that you have abused the Service by using it to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws. You should be aware that, following disclosure to any third party, your information may be accessible by others to the extent permitted or required by applicable law.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets, any user information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction, to transfer or assign your information and other information we have collected from users of the Service to third parties.  Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred user information will be subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any information you submit or that is collected after this type of transfer may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.

We generate and use aggregated, anonymized, or statistical information about the use of our Platform. We may provide this information to third parties such as advisers or consultants for research, analytical or strategic purposes. While this information will not identify you personally, in some instances these third parties may be able to combine this aggregate information with other data they have about you, or that they receive from third parties, in a manner that allows them to identify you personally.

**AD CHOICES**

Cookies and other Tracking Technologies

We use cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, statistical IDs, flash cookies, and similar tracking technologies to collect information about the activities of our visitors and registered user over time and across different Sites, such as the pages a visitor views, the links on which a visitor clicks, how frequently a visitor accesses the Platform, and other visitor attributes and behaviors.  We also collect log file information from a visitor’s browser such as web request, IP address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, and landing pages.  We may use statistical modeling tools to attempt to recognize visitors across multiple devices.

We may retain the services of third party service providers who may link personal information about a visitor – such as name or email address – to other information they may have – for example, past purchases. This information may allow us to identify assumed interests or preferences of that visitor, so that we can provide a visitor with more useful and relevant offers or services.

We use cookies and tracking technologies to, among other things:

  * Display information more effectively;
  * Gather statistical information about the use of the Platform, to understand how our Platform is used, and improve design and functionality;
  * Store, on a visitor’s device, information about that visitor’s preferences and settings;
  * Recognize a visitor when the visitor moves from page to page, or returns to use the Platform;
  * Collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Platform, pages visited, and traffic data;
  * Track responses to our marketing and advertising campaigns; and
  * For security purposes.



We also use these technologies to understand the activities and interests of our visitors, including to:

  * Measure traffic and usage of our Platform;
  * Monitor the effectiveness of our Platform;
  * Better understand the interests of visitors;
  * Recognize new or past visitors to our Sites;
  * Present more personalized content and advertisements;
  * Optimize a visitor’s shopping experience;
  * Identify visitors across devices, and third party websites; and
  * Identify improvements or enhancements to our Platform that might be of interest to our visitors



**HOW TO BLOCK COOKIES**

You can control some of our use of cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You may be able to configure certain browsers to delete or disable browser cookies. Most browsers contain information on how to control or delete cookies. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of a browser. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies and http://www.allaboutcookies.org/browsers/index.html for information on commonly used browsers.

To control flash cookies, you can visit:  http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html

Please note that blocking or disabling certain cookies may interfere with certain functionalities of some parts of our Platform. Choices you make about cookies are also browser and device specific. Further, while disabling a cookie may prevent the collection of information in the future, it does not prevent the use of information collected before the cookie was disabled. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking described in this notice will stop.

Analytics

Information collected by Google Analytics is transmitted to, and stored by, Google in accordance with its privacy practices.  To see an overview of privacy at Google and how this applies to Google Analytics, please click here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245.

To opt out of Google Analytics, please go to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

Interest-Based Advertising

We may – or may have third parties, on our behalf – display to a visitor interest-based advertising and other custom content regarding our capabilities, products or services that may be of interest to visitors. These advertisements may be served to a visitor on or through our Platform, or on third-party websites. They may be based on interactions that a visitor has had with us or our Platform, on other activities and behaviors that the visitor demonstrates online, assumed interests attributed to that visitor, browsing history, and other information gathered about that visitor over time across multiple sites.

To collect this information, our service providers may place or recognize a unique cookie on the user’s browser and use other techniques, such as pixel tags. If you are using one of our mobile applications, our ad network partners may use and store your mobile device ID or Advertising ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you.

Do Not Track

Some browsers give individuals the ability to choose not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Consequently, due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law. However, please note the capabilities below.

How to Opt-out of Interest-Based Advertising

You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising as explained below. The opt-out may be provided through specific tracking opt-out cookies. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, or erase or alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), this may also clear any opt-out cookie.

To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on a website, visit the following websites, and follow the instructions:

http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ and http://www.aboutads.info/choices

In addition, some third-party businesses may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.  For more information about the opt-out process, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative, you may want to visit:

http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/  and  http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

Mobile device visitors may also download the AppChoices app at:

www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out from interested based advertising served in mobile apps.

The features above will allow a visitor to opt out of many –but not all – of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.

Data Retention

You can request that we stop using your information to provide you services by contacting us at the address provided in the “How to Contact Us” section.

Information Security

We take reasonable measures to protect any personal information we may hold in order to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. In some areas of our Platforms, we may use Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) or Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) encryption technology to enhance data privacy and help prevent loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control.

We cannot guarantee, however, that all information will remain secure. The Internet by its nature is a public forum. We encourage you to use caution when disclosing information online. Often, you are in the best situation to protect yourself online. You are responsible for protecting your login ID and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.

Consent to Transfer of Information

If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect about you will be transferred for processing to the United States or other countries or jurisdictions that may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

By registering for, and using the Platform, you consent to the transfer and storage of your personal information to the U.S. or to any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities.

Marketing Choices

Company material is provided at no cost to all visitors.  In order to finance some of the operations of the Platform, we have opted to make it available to advertisements by third parties. We may use aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements targeted to a specific audience. Based upon the aggregated information we have collected about visitors, we display the advertisement to the intended audience based on these general criteria. Some advertisement methodology may be directed to a specific individual, and may be based on the specific apparent interest of the visitor of a specific device.

Electronic Communications

If you receive commercial electronic communications from us, you can unsubscribe from the receipt of future commercial electronic communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. Please also note that if you do opt out of receiving emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages (such as updates about your account or service changes), and you cannot opt out from receiving these messages. **Please note that even though you may opt-out of receiving marketing-related Communications from us, we may still send you important administrative messages.**

We may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transaction that you began before requesting a change or deletion. In addition, it is likely that residual information might remain within our databases, back-ups or other records and might not be removed.

Shine the Light

Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, also known as the “Shine the Light Law,” any users of the Platform who are California residents are entitled to request and receive once a year, free of charge, a notice from us describing what categories of customer information (if any) we shared with third parties, including our corporate affiliates, for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.  If applicable, the notice will identify the categories of information that we shared, and the names and addresses of the third parties and affiliates with which we shared your information.

If you are a California resident and would like to request a copy of this notice, please submit a written request by email to the address provided in the “how to contact us” section. In your request, please specify that you want a “California Privacy Rights Notice.”  Please allow at least thirty (30) days for a response.

In addition, if you are a California resident under the age of 18 and are a registered user, you may request that we remove content or information that you posted on our Platform or stored on our servers by submitting a request by email to the address provided in the “how to contact us” section. In your request, you must clearly identify the content or information you wish to have removed and provide sufficient information to allow us to locate the content or information to be removed.  However, please note that we are not required to erase or otherwise eliminate content or information if: (a) other state or federal laws require us or a third party to maintain the content or information; (b) the content or information was posted, stored, or republished by another user; (c) the content or information is anonymized so that the minor cannot be individually identified; (d) the minor does not follow the instructions posted in this Privacy Notice on how to request removal of such content or information; and (e) the minor has received compensation or other consideration for providing the content.  Further, nothing in this provision shall be construed to limit the authority of a law enforcement agency to obtain such content or information.
