**SOURCES OF DATA**

  * WEB FORMS



Most of the personal data we collect comes through various forms across our Platform. Certain fields on these forms are mandatory in order for us to complete the associated transactions. Mandatory fields are indicated with an asterisks.

  * BROWSER



We also collect data from your browser. This data collection occurs automatically as a consequence of your browser interacting with our servers. This data is captured in logs

  * COOKIES



See the section titled “Online Tracking and Your Choices” below for information about our cookie policy.

  * THIRD-PARTIES



We collect personal information from third-party service providers including OpenTable (restaurant reservations), Seven Rooms (restaurant reservations), Hotpoint (photo booths), Zenreach (Wi-Fi access), Ticketmaster (ticket sales to events), Bookmyshow (ticket sales to events), American Express (global dining program), Facebook (Facebook lead forms), Full Contact (provides additional contact information by matching e-mail address with full contact database, and verifies e-mail addresses are valid), Hotspot International (photo booths), Woobox (sweepstakes administration), and New Epoch (sweepstakes administration). We only receive your information from these services if you give them consent to share it with us.

**_WHY WE COLLECT_**

We collect this information for the following purposes:

  * _Commercial Transactions_ : We use your contact/identification information, in conjunction with your payment information through our payment processor, to complete online purchases and communicate any relevant information after the purchase is complete. We also pay some of our affiliates commissions when an affiliate refers someone to us who then makes a purchase. The advocate link allows us to track which referrals came to us through which affiliate, so that we can calculate commissions.
  * _Improve Platform/Services_ : We use several categories of information listed above to help us understand how users interact with our Platform, so we can improve user experience and improve our product offerings. The analytics tools we use to analyze this data have the capability of identifying individual users under some circumstances; however, we only use these capabilities to generate sample data reports. We do not use these capabilities to identify individuals.
  * _Marketing/Promotions_ : We send promotional emails from time to time to users who opt-in to receive such emails (you can unsubscribe any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email). We send promotional emails in relation to your birthday; however, these are based on the month and day of your birthday only (not your birth year). We use social media usernames to assist us in de-duplicating contacts in our marketing database. This de-duplication helps us avoid sending duplicate advertising to the same person through multiple e-mail addresses. We also create custom audiences for social media advertising.
  * _Legal Compliance_ : We collect birthdates and addresses to help us comply with certain regulations such as age restrictions on attending some of our venues and consent for processing personal data, and online communications.



**_GDPR LAWFUL BASES_**

In accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we have determined that we have the following legal bases to collect and process personal information of users who are in the EEA:

  * _Contract_ : We process personal information of EU users in order to complete contractual obligations such as selling/honoring tickets to events, making/honoring reservations (for VIP tables) at events and restaurants, and honoring employment contracts.
  * _Legal Obligation_ : We process personal information of EU users in order to meet legal obligations with various regulatory authorities which impose certain restrictions on us, such as age restrictions on some of our venues.
  * _Legitimate Interests_ : We process personal information of EU users in order to advance legitimate interests such as communicating information about our products and services. When we rely on our legitimate interests as a reason for processing your personal information, we have already considered whether or not those interests are overridden by your rights, and have concluded that they are not. Our legitimate interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your explicit consent or are otherwise required or permitted by law). In determining whether our legitimate interests override your rights, we consider the nature of both your interests and ours, the impact the processing will have on you, and any safeguards which are or could be put in place. Our legitimate interests for processing your personal information include: 
    * Reservations: We may use your personal data to complete and administer your online reservations;
    * Customer service: We use your personal data to provide customer service to you;
    * Direct marketing activities: We use your personal data for marketing activities, such as marketing communications and running sweepstakes or contests.

    * Analytics, improvement, and research: We use personal data to conduct research and analysis so that we can improve our products and services, enhance the user experience, and improve our website. The analytics tools we use to analyze this data have the capability of identifying individual users under some circumstances; however, we only use these capabilities to generate sample data reports. We do not use these capabilities to identify individuals;

    * Payments: We use personal data to collect payments for purchases made from us;

**_THIRD-PARTY SITES & SOCIAL MEDIA_**:

Our Site contains links to third-party websites and includes social media features to interact with Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. These third-party sites collect information about you and record information about your browsing behavior. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature, not by our privacy policy.

We use your information to deliver ads to you on social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter.

**_DATA SHARING_**

We do not share your personal information outside of our corporate group for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to our products and services without asking you first. We do not rent or sell our customer lists. However, there are still a few limited situations where we share personal information:

  * _External processing_ : We have vendors, service providers, and technicians who help with some of our processing and storage. They also assist with monitoring our servers for technical problems. These external processors potentially access your information while doing their work, but they are not allowed to use any of your data for purposes unrelated to our products and services.
  * _Data validation/enrichment_ : We share personal data with a third-party service provider called [FullContact](https://www.fullcontact.com/) for the purpose of verifying if the data is current, as well as enriching it with relevant information from public databases, such as location and demographics.
  * _Business transitions_ : Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the items sold or transferred. We will request a purchaser to treat our data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection.
  * _Legal reasons_ : We will provide information to a third party if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so for legal reasons. For example, to respond to legal process, or comply with state and federal laws (or the applicable laws of foreign countries other than the United States).
  * _Aggregate/Anonymized data_ : We share non-personal information (for example, aggregated or anonymized customer data) publicly and with our partners. For example, we publish trends about our events and venues. We take steps to keep this non-personal information from being associated with you and we require our partners to do the same.
  * _Cross-border transfers_ – Your personal information will be collected, processed and stored by us or our service providers in the United States and other countries outside the European Union where our servers reside. As a result, your personal information may be subject to legal requirements, including lawful requirements to disclose personal information to government authorities, in those jurisdictions.
