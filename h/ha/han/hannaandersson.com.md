# Privacy Statement

### WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THIS POLICY?

This policy applies to Hanna Andersson's treatment of personally identifiable information that Hanna Andersson collects through its website, mobile site or apps and when you use Hanna Andersson's services. The policy does not apply to practices of companies whose websites may be linked to or from this website. For access to the privacy policies of such linked websites, please refer to the information provided by such websites at their home pages.

### WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?

Hanna collects two different types of information about you: First, you provide us with certain personal information when you interact with the Services. Second, we collect certain information automatically as you use the Services.

a. Personal Information

You provide us with certain personal information when making a purchase (online, through the call center or at a store), logging into your account, registering with us, requesting a catalog, signing up for email updates, participating in a survey, interacting with Hanna (via social media, chat, email or phone), or participating in our referral program. The information collected may include your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, birthday, gender, credit card number, and other personal information. Some of this information is optional.

In addition to your personal information, we may maintain a record of your purchases and any content you send us. For example, when you become part of the #HANNAJAMS or #ILOVEMYHANNAS gallery, we keep a copy of the photo you submit. When you send a message, we keep a copy of the message to ensure your questions are answered in a helpful and speedy manner.

b. Information collected automatically

Certain information is collected automatically when you use our Services. For example, when you visit our website, we collect your IP address and maintain a record of your activity on the website. If you access our website from a mobile device, we collect unique device IDs, as well as aggregate geolocation information, which helps us understand where our customers are located. We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have so we can identify you as a Hanna customer. For example, we may link your activity in a Hanna store to your use of the Hanna website [or app]. This allows us to provide the best shopping experience possible. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile applications, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.

### WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW DOES HANNA USE THEM?

Hanna and its trusted business partners employ technology features known as cookies and web beacons to understand how you interact with our website and email messages. These are small snippets of code or text files used for site usage analytics and content and advertising personalization. Cookies are stored by your browser on your hard drive. Hanna does not save any password or credit card information in cookies. Hanna does place a unique identifier in the cookie, which allows us to link your computer to the information we store in our database. We also allow third-party companies to place cookies and web beacons that collect certain information when you visit our website or use our mobile app. This information is used to serve you with ads for our products and our partners' products that are likely to interest you. These ads may appear on third-party websites.

This allows us to provide a more personalized experience on our website, including remembering items placed in your shopping cart for 14 days, emailing you with recommendations, auto-filling forms, and providing enhanced online display advertising and other information tailored to your interests. In this way, Hanna uses both session cookies (which track a user's progression during one site visit) and persistent cookies (which track a user over time). In addition, Hanna uses certain technologies, such as cross device tracking, for remarketing purposes.

All of this technology is used to deliver a more relevant and convenient experience for you. Certain tracking technologies may not be disabled. However, you have the choice to refuse cookies by turning them off in your Internet browser. If you choose not to accept cookies, you will not be able to purchase from the Hanna website. If you prefer, you may call Customer Service at 800-222-0544 to place your order.

### DO-NOT-TRACK REQUESTS

Your Internet browser and mobile device may allow you to adjust your browser settings so that "do not track" requests are sent to the websites you visit. Hanna does not respond to "do not track" requests at this time.

These targeted advertisements may appear on our site or on other sites that you visit. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. Besides IP addresses, no personally identifiable information is collected in this process. The Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") provides additional information about targeted advertising.

d. Transfer or Assignment in Connection with Business Transfers or Bankruptcy

In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets, any user information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction, to transfer or assign your personal information and other information we have collected from users of the Services to third parties. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, or as otherwise agreed to by you, the use and disclosure of all transferred user information will be subject to this Statement.

  * we are required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order;
  * we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, or to protect our property or other rights or those of other users of the Services, third parties or the public at large;
  * we believe that you have abused a Service by using it to attack or gain unauthorized access to a system or to engage in spamming or other conduct that violates applicable laws or Hanna's website terms of use. 

f. Aggregate Information




We may share aggregate or de-identified information without restriction.

### HOW DOES HANNA PROTECT MY INFORMATION?

We use a third-party payment processor, which is also PCI DSS compliant.

The Hanna website also displays the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that the site has been authenticated by VeriSign and that confidential transactions with our site are secured by SSL encryption.

Our customer service center and stores also operate over a private, secure network.

### WHAT IF THERE ARE CHANGES MADE TO THIS POLICY?

Hanna Andersson may make updates to this policy from time to time. Any updates that are made will be posted on this page at least 14 days before such updates become effective.
