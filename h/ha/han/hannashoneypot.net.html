        <h3>3.2. Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p class="textj">Pulsar Media B.V. may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience.  A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. </p>
        <p class="textj">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.  For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.  Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.. </p>
        <p class="textj">Pulsar Media B.V. reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website.</p>

        <p class="textj">Visitors to our website can register to purchase services.  When you register, we will request some personal information such as name, address, email, telephone number or facsimile number, account number and other relevant information.  If you are purchasing a service, we will request financial information.  Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the services you purchased.

        <h3>4. USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES</h3>
        <p class="textj">Pulsar Media B.V. web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes also called single-pixel gifs - that allow Pulsar Media B.V. to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.  Pulsar Media B.V. may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
        <p class="textj">Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications.  These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer.  This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site.  Pulsar Media B.V. prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.</p>
