# Privacy Statement for Hantsweb

### What it covers

This policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that Hampshire County Council collects when you are in the [hants.gov.uk](http://www.hants.gov.uk/) domain. Links within this domain to other web sites are not covered by this policy.

### Information collection

You can visit our site and use many of the services without telling us who you are or giving us any personally identifiable information.

The Council does not use cookies for the general running of the site. Cookies may be used on some 'interactive' pages to provide additional functionality or when it is totally necessary to maintain a unique 'id.' on your browser whilst you use those pages. Where cookies are used their purpose will be made clear.

It is only when you complete a form that requests personal information or email Hampshire County Council that you can be identified. When completing forms you may be asked for a variety of personal information such as name, address, post code etc. 

Hampshire County Council automatically receives and records information on server logs from your browser. The Council only monitors the  IP addresses of visitors to assess which pages are the most popular. These IP addresses are not linked to any personal data so all visitors to our site remain anonymous.

### Information use

Where you voluntarily choose to give us your personal details the personal data you give Hampshire County Council will be used exclusively for providing you with the information or service you have requested.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Hampshire County Council will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone.

Hampshire County Council will only send personally identifiable information about you to other organisations when we have your consent. This is only necessary when we need to share your information in order to provide the information or service requested. We also use the information in response to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process.

### **Security:**

While we strive to keep the information that you supply secure, please be aware that the Internet is not a fully secure medium. We use  secure servers for collecting sensitive information.

### **Policy changes:**

By using our site you agree to accept this privacy policy and are aware that our policy may change with time. Any changes to this policy will appear on this web page.

**Cookie**  
Message given to a web **** browser by a web server.
