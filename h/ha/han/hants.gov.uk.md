# Privacy

## What it covers

This policy covers the use of personally identifiable information that Hampshire County Council collects when you visit Hantsweb [www.hants.gov.uk](http://www.hants.gov.uk/).

## Information collection

Hampshire County Council collects and analyses visitor information. However this does not involve collecting personal data and is used to improve the user experience and to measure the number of visitors to our site.

Hampshire County Council may ask you to submit personal information – for example your name, your postcode and email address. 

Hampshire County Council does not store this information on its own servers. 

Rather; during the course of a visit to [www.hants.gov.uk](http://www.hants.gov.uk/), a file called a '[cookie](http://www3.hants.gov.uk/privacy#cookie)' may be created on your computer. If you visit us again, this cookie will mean that you will not need to tell us again information you’ve already provided. Cookies help us provide you with a better user experience by personalising your visit. By recording details such as your home postcode we can further customise your view of Hantsweb to show local services, news and events.

## Information use

Where you voluntarily choose to give us your personal details the personal data you provide Hampshire County Council will be used exclusively for providing you with the information or service you have requested.

In some cases we may invite you to sign up for additional services at the same time (for example, a regular mailing list): you can choose not to accept this invitation.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Hampshire County Council will only send personally identifiable information about you to other organisations when we have your consent. We will only pass information on in order to provide the information or service you have requested or if we are required to by law.

## Data Protection

When you supply personal information to Hampshire County Council we have a legal obligation to you in how we protect and use that information. We must, for example, tell you when we are collecting such data and why, and if we intend to pass this information on to a third party. You must give us your permission if you wish us to pass your details on to a third party partner.

You have the legal right to request a copy of any information that we hold about you.

For further information on the Data Protection Act 1998, subject access request forms and contacting the Data Protection Officer, please see the [Hampshire County Council Data Protection pages](http://www3.hants.gov.uk/service826).

## Security:

While we strive to keep the information that you supply secure, please be aware that the Internet is not a fully secure medium. We use [secure servers](http://www3.hants.gov.uk/privacy#secure) for collecting sensitive information.

#### By using our site you agree to accept this privacy policy and are aware that our policy may change with time. Any changes to this policy will appear on this web page.

Summary of terms

###  **What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small amount of text, with a variety of uses such as storing login information, holding the contents of a “shopping basket” on an e-commerce site, or for recording that you have visited a site previously. Websites can only access the cookies that they have previously sent to you, and not other sites’ cookies.

Cookies are also used to hold preferences for a site that a user has previously selected, such as font size or other aspects of the appearance or layout of a web site. 

There are many misconceptions about cookies – that they carry viruses, that they are a type of Spyware (i.e. they can read personal information on your computer) and that they are only used by advertising companies. In reality, cookies are merely pieces of text and cannot carry out any malicious activity on a computer. However, they are used by some websites to collect anonymous data about user to create a profile which can be used for analysing site usage patterns and for targeted marketing of adverts on a web site. This latter example is known as a third-party cookie.

Most current web browsers support the use of cookies but users can select whether to accept them or not. Increasingly it is possible to be selective about the activity of cookies (i.e. whether to only allow them from the originating site and not from third parties), to only allow cookies during the active browsing session (i.e. so that the cookies expire when the browser is closed and are not stored on the computer). You can still browse Hantsweb if you have chosen to reject cookies.

#### IP (Internet Protocol)

All networks connected to the internet speak IP, the technical standard which allows data to be transmitted between two devices. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is responsible for making sure messages get from one host to another and that the messages are understood.

#### IP address

If you are connected to the Internet you have one, for example it may look something like this 198.184.98.9

#### Secure Server

This allows information to be sent 'securely' by encrypting the information you send.
