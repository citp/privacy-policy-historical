# Privacy

## What it covers

This policy covers the use of personally identifiable information that Hampshire County Council collects when you visit Hantsweb [www.hants.gov.uk](http://www.hants.gov.uk/).

## Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task 

  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested 

  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast 




You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through [Internet browser cookies – what they are and how to manage them](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/SiteInformation/DG_197506?CID=Central&PLA=url_mon&CRE=managing_cookies)

### Our use of cookies

**Cookies for improving service**

Google Analytics sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to the website and volumes of usage. This to ensure that the service is available when you want it and fast.

Hantsweb uses cookies for collecting non-personal user information from the site. Hantsweb does not collect any information about you except that required for system administration of the website.

Cookies are pieces of data created when you visit a site, and contain a unique, anonymous number. They are stored in the cookie directory of your hard drive, and do not expire at the end of your session. Cookies do not contain any personal information about you and cannot be used to identify an individual user. If you choose not to accept the cookie, this will not affect your access to the majority of facilities available on our website.

Although your browser may be set up to allow the creation of cookies, you can specify that you be prompted before a site puts a cookie on your hard disk, so that you can decide whether to allow or disallow the cookie. Alternatively, you can set your computer not to accept any cookie.

This site uses Google Analytics code to gather statistical information. For more information on how Google Analytics processes this information, visit www.google.com/analytics.

## Information use

Where you voluntarily choose to give us your personal details the personal data you provide Hampshire County Council will be used exclusively for providing you with the information or service you have requested.

In some cases we may invite you to sign up for additional services at the same time (for example, a regular mailing list): you can choose not to accept this invitation.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Hampshire County Council will only send personally identifiable information about you to other organisations when we have your consent. We will only pass information on in order to provide the information or service you have requested or if we are required to by law.

## Data Protection

When you supply personal information to Hampshire County Council we have a legal obligation to you in how we protect and use that information. We must, for example, tell you when we are collecting such data and why, and if we intend to pass this information on to a third party. You must give us your permission if you wish us to pass your details on to a third party partner.

You have the legal right to request a copy of any information that we hold about you.

For further information on the Data Protection Act 1998, subject access request forms and contacting the Data Protection Officer, please see the [Hampshire County Council Data Protection pages](http://www3.hants.gov.uk/service826).

## Security:

While we strive to keep the information that you supply secure, please be aware that the Internet is not a fully secure medium. We use secure servers for collecting sensitive information.
