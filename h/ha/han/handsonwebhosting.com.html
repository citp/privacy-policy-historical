        <p>TSS is committed to respecting online privacy and recognizes customers' need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information shared with TSS. This privacy statement covers the information gathering and dissemination practices for this site: <a href="http://www.totalserversolutions.com"> www.totalserversolutions.com</a> (the "Site")</p>
        
        <p>Personal information for purposes of this policy is any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit the Site without revealing any personal information. By using this Site, you consent to the terms of this policy (as they may be revised or updated) and to TSS's processing of personal information for the purposes given in this policy as well as those explained where TSS collects personal information on the Site.</p>
        
        <p>TSS strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect customers' privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, TSS intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer personal information to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for personal information.</p>

        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Choice and Data Collection</strong></p>
        
        <p>When requesting information about TSS's products and/or services, you will be required to register and give TSS certain personal information (such as first and last name, email address and company name). TSS uses this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to TSS. If you choose not to provide the personal information TSS requests, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.</p>
        
        <p>TSS does not collect personal information about individuals unless such information is provided on a voluntary basis. TSS may collect IP addresses and or Domain Names (where applicable) of visitors to the Site, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and information volunteered by a consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information TSS collects is used to improve the content of the Site, customize the content and/or layout of the Site's pages for each individual consumer, to notify customers and other consumers about updates to the Site, to respond to requests for information, to help diagnose problems, administer the Site and to contact consumers for marketing purposes.</p>
        
        <p>TSS takes reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
      
        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
        
        <p>Users should also be aware that non-personal information, data and traffic patterns may be automatically collected through the standard operation of the Site web server or through the use of "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A cookie file may contain information such as a user ID that the Site uses to track the pages a user has visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.</p>

        <p>TSS's use of these technologies allows TSS to determine the usefulness of the information on the Site to users and to see how effective the navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. TSS may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics. TSS may provide aggregated cookie data to third parties for analysis purposes. TSS is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
        
        <p>If you prefer not to receive cookies on this Site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of the Site.</p>

        <p>If the Site contains links to other sites owned and maintained by companies other than TSS, TSS is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. Users should check the applicable privacy policy of such linked sites.</p>
        
        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>
        
        <p>TSS only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of TSS in the following limited circumstances: (1) TSS has your consent; (2) to subsidiaries, affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf, provided such parties have agreed to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other confidentiality and security measures, as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion; and (3) TSS has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of TSS, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
        </p>
        
        <p>If all or part of TSS is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the information that you have provided at this site may be transferred as part of that transaction. However, TSS will take reasonable steps to assure that such information is used in a manner consistent with the policy under which it was collected.</p>
        <p>It is against TSS's policy to sell personal information collected through its Site without consent.</p>
        
        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Opt-Out and Update Procedures</strong></p>
        
        <p>If, at any time after registering for information or ordering TSS's services, you (i) change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, or (ii) would like to review, change, delete or modify personally identifiable information previously provided, then you may contact TSS by e-mail at <a href="mailto:customercare@totalserversolutions.com" target="_blank">customercare@totalserversolutions.com.</a> TSS will respond to any such request within thirty (30) days of our receipt of the same. TSS will give you with a copy of any personal information that you have provided in connection with your visit to the Site upon request and delivery of evidence of your identity. We may require a nominal administration fee to cover our costs in providing such informati on.</p>
        
        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Information Security</strong></p>
        
        <p>Wherever your personal information may be held by TSS or on its behalf, TSS intends to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. TSS uses reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of all data, not just personal information. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. Only those who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve TSS's services have the information. They are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
        
        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Site Security</strong></p>
        
        <p>The Site has physical, administrative and technical measures in place to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the data under our control, and to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of such data. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of all data. While TSS strives to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us. You send any information via the Site at your own risk.</p>
        
        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Changes To Policy</strong></p>
        
        <p>Please note that this policy may change from time to time. TSS will not materially reduce your rights with respect to treatment of personal information under this policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, TSS will post any policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, TSS will take reasonable steps, whether by e-mail, posting on the Site home page for a reasonable period of time or otherwise, to notify you of such changes.</p>
        
        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
        
        <p>When TSS receives formal written complaints (whether by e-mail through this Site or otherwise), it is TSS's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. This policy and the statements outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
        <p class="dark-gray"><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
        
        <p>If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@totalserversolutions.com" target="_blank">customercare@totalserversolutions.com.</a> or via our contact information on our website.</p>
