# Our Privacy Policy : Men's Suit Hangers : Wood Hangers : Kirby Allison’s Hanger Project

## Privacy Policy 

We understand that your trust is our most important asset and are committed to the protection and proper use of your personal information. We are further committed to maintaining an understanding of the products you find to be most valuable and your feedback. We respect your privacy and take great care to safeguard information in our possession.

What Information Do We Collect?   
We collect various types of information depending upon how you use our site. When you order from us, we collect your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, phone number, and credit card number (with expiration date). We also gather information on the person who will receive any gift you send (e.g., that person's name and address) and we will retain a record of your purchases. 

When you become a registered user at HangerProject.com, we collect your name, billing and mailing addresses, email address, and a password. This information is gathered to make your shopping experience as a registered user the quickest, and easiest possible. However, we do not store any Credit Card information. We use PayPal as our Merchant Processor (we connect directly with their server to process credit card transactions) as a further commitment to safeguarding your credit card information. 

Like most standard sites we use log files. They include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the website, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may use a third party to help analyze our log files. These companies are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available from HangerProject.com. 

What Are Cookies and Do We Use Them?   
A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web site that may be saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. At HangerProject.com, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.

Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser, they go away. We use session cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to shop at HangerProject.com. For example, the Session ID cookie that we ask your browser to hold retains the ID for your shopping bag. Without the Session ID cookie, you can't add merchandise to your bag and carry it to Checkout. 

Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they do not go away when you exit your browser. At HangerProject.com, you may choose to accept a persistent cookie to give you a more personalized shopping experience and to help you navigate our store more efficiently. We use your information to enhance your site experience. However, you can use our site without accepting a persistent cookie. To do so, you should set your browser options to reject persistent cookies. Alternatively, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, which gives you the opportunity to decide whether you want to accept it or not. 

Cookies can be used by a web site to recognize you. But that does not necessarily mean any personal information is stored in the cookies. At HangerProject.com, we store no personal information about you in the cookies. Anything you choose to tell us about yourself (such as your name, address, or payment information) is stored safely and separately on our secured servers, and you need to provide a password to access it. 

We also use cookies to look at how groups, rather than individuals, use our Web site. In our physical store, we can observe which aisles and departments are most heavily trafficked and determine what displays or sales are the most successful. Then, we can identify ways to improve the customer experience. On the Web, cookies help us develop a similar understanding so that we can continue to improve the arrangement, product offerings, and merchandise placement you see at HangerProject.com. 

We may use your information in a number of ways, including the following:

  * To improve the content on our Web site. For example, we may use log files to find out which parts of our site or our products are visited most often. 
  * To enhance your online shopping experience. For example, we may use it to recognize you and welcome you to the site. 
  * For marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we send out emails to our customers about products or events that we think may be of interest to them. Marketing and promotional emails will only be sent to those individuals who have opted in to receiving email.
  * We also may send you offers for discounts or free services (e.g., free gift wrap or shipping) on our site. 



Do We Share Your Information?  
In short, no, we do not share your information with any third parties. We use the information you provide about yourself when inquiring for services to fulfill your request. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that inquiry (i.e., U.S. Postal Service to deliver your package). We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. You can register with our web site if you would like to receive updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our web site will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out a subscription form. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
