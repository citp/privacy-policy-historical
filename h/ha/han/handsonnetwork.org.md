# Privacy Policy | Points of Light

Points of Light has adopted and implemented this privacy policy as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information from misuse. While this policy focuses on online collection of information related to your interaction with Points of Light's website (the "website"), it applies to Points of Light's collection policies in general.

**What information does Points of Light collect?**  
The website's registration, online surveys, contest and product order forms may ask users to provide personally identifiable information in one of three ways: through contact information (including, without limitation, name, address, phone number (home, work and/or cell), fax number and e-mail address), demographic information (including, without limitation, race, gender, ethnicity, and age) and, in some cases, financial information (including, without limitation, organizational income (when on behalf of an organization) and credit card number (when on behalf of an individual). Some information will be required for you to avail yourself of that particular feature of the website. None of this personally identifiable information will be shared with third parties or used to market third party products or services; it will only be used as described below.

From time to time, we may use the standard "cookie" feature of major browser applications that allows us to store data about your visit. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms on our website other than cookies. You may configure your web browser to prevent cookies from being set on your computer.

Points of Light may also gather anonymous, or aggregate, information, which may be used by us or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of numeric codes used to identify a computer.

**What does Points of Light do with collected information?**  
We use personally identifiable information from our online registration, survey, contest and order forms to send you information about Points of Light and its various projects and initiatives, or to communicate with you about a project in which you are participating. If you supply contact information, it may also be used to contact you for other purposes.

Points of Light may use your IP address (the number assigned to your computer while it is on the Internet) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. If you shop on the website, your IP address may be used to help identify your computer and your online "shopping cart" and to gather broad demographic information. If you submit financial information, it will be used to check your qualifications and to bill you for products and services you have ordered.

_Donor Bill of Rights*_

_The Donor Bill of Rights was created by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the Giving Institute: Leading Consultants to Non-Profits. It has been endorsed by numerous organizations._

Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:

  1. To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.
  2. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.
  3. To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.
  4. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.
  5. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.
  6. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.
  7. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.
  8. To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.
  9. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.
  10. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.
