**THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT NAMG COLLECTS ONLINE**  
NAMG generally collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enroll in a club, enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, mailing address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. 

Additionally, our web server automatically collects click-stream information such as the address (or "URL") of the website that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site.

Whenever you request a page from The Websites your IP address, browser and version, operating system, and the site from which you came are stored in a log file. This information cannot be used to identify a specific individual. This information is used for statistical purposes in order to improve The Websites and provide accurate statistics to track usage on The Websites. Your IP address is used to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer The Websites.

**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS  
**Customers residing in California may submit a request for disclosure of (1) the categories of personal information that we may share with third parties, and (2) a list of the names and addresses of all third parties with whom we have shared such information for their marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request this information, please submit a request to:

**HOW NAMG USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU**  
We use the information you provide in order to 1) fulfill requests for products, services or information, 2) administer your membership accounts, 3) provide member services, 4) administer contests or promotions, 5) offer new products and services, 6) measure and improve the effectiveness of our websites or our marketing endeavors, 7) tailor our online offerings to your preferences, and 8) other business purposes. NAMG will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your information used for marketing communications.

We may combine personal information that you provide to us online with outside records to enhance our ability to market products or provide services that we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, we may share your information with our affiliates and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared, write to us at [optout@namginc.com](mailto:optout@namginc.com). 

Except as provided herein so long as you activate your membership, NAMG will not sell to any third party your email address unless you provide your informed consent, except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, police investigations, or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant. Your informed consent shall be in the form of an "opt in" or similar policy. 

NAMG allows access to database information by third parties providing technical services, such as e-mail, but only to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. In those instances, the third party is bound by these terms. Your informed consent shall be in the form of an "opt in" or similar policy. You understand and agree that we may disclose to third parties your zip code, gender and/or age, but only in the form of aggregated information. In addition, you agree that we may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, email address, member name and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of NAMG or its affiliated entities.

We reserve the right to offer you third party services and products based on the preferences that you identify during the registration process or from information gathered from surveys and based on your subsequent preferences; such offers may be provided to you by NAMG.

We reserve the right to terminate your account if we learn that you have provided NAMG with false or misleading registration information.

We may also disclose users' personal information if we believe that we are required to do so (i) by law, (ii) to comply with legal process or governmental requests, (iii) to enforce our [Terms of Service](http://namginc.com/terms_of_service.html), or (iv) to protect the rights, property, or safety of NAMG, its users or the public.

**THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS**  
We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to website hosting, order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance, e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, emailing and other services of an administrative nature. Personal information, including financial information, is shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. 

**COOKIES**  
"Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of the site and allow tracking of usage behavior. Cookies are used to compile aggregate data that allows content improvements and targeted advertising. We share aggregated data (information that does not identify you) with third parties. Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you do not want non-personal information about your visits collected through the use of cookies, you may set your computer to deny or accept the cookie feature through a simple process in most browsers; however, without cookies we may be unable to provide you with certain features (e.g., customized or personalized delivery of information) otherwise available on The Websites. 

**CHILDREN  
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Websites are not directed at children under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not provide any personal information on The Websites. We will not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information online from children under the age of 18.**

**FORUMS, MESSAGE/BULLETIN BOARDS, VIDEOS, BLOGS, SOCIAL NETWORKING** **     **Users of forums and message/bulletin boards that may be on The Websites should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address, etc.) on a message/bulletin board, in a chat area, or other interactive area where personal information can be posted, the information can be collected and used by other internet users. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to the security of information you voluntarily post in chat rooms and message/bulletin boards. Please refer to the Terms of Service for additional terms regarding use of these services. 

**SEND-TO-A-FRIEND TOOLS**  
The Websites may, from time to time, include a send-to-a-friend application that makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from The Websites to friends or family by e-mail. In order to address your e-mail message, the application will ask you to input the recipient’s e-mail address and/or similar information (including your e-mail address). This information is only used by the application to address your message so that it can be properly sent. NAMG does not retain any of this information for any purpose.

**LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES**  
Some of The Websites may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, games, services, subscriptions and other applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis. Those transactions may take place on a NAMG site, or the site of the third party. In either case, personal information you provide in connection with the transaction may be shared with the third party, as well as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such opportunities and features. The Websites may contain links to third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites that may be accessible through The Websites. The linked sites are not under the control of NAMG, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any linked site, or any link contained in a linked site. We are providing these links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on our websites does not imply endorsement of the linked site by NAMG. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other sites to learn how they collect and use information about you.

USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS  
Some areas of The Websites require you to select a user name and password. Users will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any user name and password, and we will not be responsible for misuse of any user names or passwords by any third party, whether authorized by a user or not. 

**SECURITY**  
NAMG maintains practices and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of personal information collection through the Sites. A firewall protects the e-mail server to which all personal information is delivered. Access to the information is limited to those employees and contractors who need it to carry out their business functions. NAMG's employees are educated about the importance of safeguarding personal information and preventing unauthorized access, disclosure and use. Finally, we use secure server software ("SSL") that encrypts credit card information (including your name and address) submitted to any of The Websites. This encryption protects this information so it cannot be viewed as it is transmitted over the Internet. 

**UNITED STATES ONLY**  
The Websites are intended for use by residents of the United States of America only. All matters relating to The Websites are governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota in the United States of America. If you are located outside of the United States of America and you contact us, please be advised that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States of America and that by submitting information, you explicitly authorize its transfer.

**OPT-OUT**  
You may inform us if you wish to remove your personal information from our database, and we will comply with your request as soon as reasonably possible. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records. We reserve the right, from time to time, to re-contact former users of The Websites.
