First, to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience, we will periodically send offers and other information about our products and services to groups of customers that appear to have similar interests. For example, if you bought dog food with the coupon, we may send you valuable offers for dog food or other related items available at Hannaford. 

Second, to provide additional value to our customers, we may allow our suppliers to provide offers to a select group of customers that may be interested in their items. To ensure your personal data is protected, we will obtain the materials from the supplier and communicate offers directly to our customers. 

In all instances, the information will only be used to provide information and offers regarding products and service available at Hannaford.
