# Hancock Bank Privacy Policy

**  
******HANCOCK HOLDING COMPANY****  
  


__**PRIVACY POLICY NOTICE**__

For over a century, we at Hancock Holding Company, Inc. have forged customer relationships built on strength, stability, integrity, and service. Hancock Holding Company is made up of a number of affiliated companies including Hancock Bank, Hancock Bank of Louisiana, Hancock Investments, Inc., Hancock Mortgage Company, Hancock Insurance Company, Harrison Life Insurance Company, and Harrison Finance Company (the "Affiliates" or "Hancock"), that work together in bringing you products and services to meet your financial needs. In choosing to do business with Hancock, you entrust us with financial information that is personally identifiable to you and not otherwise publicly available ("Confidential Information"). We honor your trust by protecting the privacy and security of Confidential Information that you and others share with us. We believe you should know how we collect, use and safeguard such personal information and what your options are as a valued customer of one of America’s strongest, safest full-service financial institutions. This Privacy Policy shall replace and supersede any previous privacy notices or policies of Hancock or other provisions relating to privacy matters.

**_Collecting And Using Confidential Information To Serve Your Needs_**

Hancock gathers Confidential Information from a variety of sources and uses such information in order to (i) administer our relationships with you, (ii) provide you with efficient customer service; and (iii) help us identify and determine your eligibility for other financial products and services that may be of value to you.

Hancock may collect the following Confidential Information about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, social security number, assets and income;
  * Information about your transactions with us, our Affiliates, or others, such as your account balance and payment history;
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency, such as your creditworthiness and credit history.



**_Safeguarding Your Confidential Information_**

Hancock uses established security standards and procedures to help protect Confidential Information from unauthorized access and improper use or disclosure. We maintain Confidential Information in secure environments using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to protect against unauthorized access. We restrict access to Confidential Information to those employees who need to know such information to administer your accounts and to provide products and services to meet your needs. We regularly train our employees on privacy and information security and on their obligations to protect Confidential Information. Furthermore, we hold our employees accountable so that they adhere to such policies and procedures in order to protect against the improper use or disclosure of Confidential Information.

**_Maintaining Accurate Information_**

We continually strive to maintain complete and accurate information on you and your accounts. If you ever determine that your account information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please call or write to us at the telephone number or address listed on your account statement. We will correct any inaccuracies as quickly as possible.

**_Limiting And Controlling The Sharing Of Confidential Information_**

Hancock primarily shares Confidential Information about you so that we may provide you with the financial products and services that you want and expect. In order to protect your privacy, Hancock carefully controls our sharing of any such information. We will not disclose any Confidential Information to anyone, except as outlined below or as permitted or required by law. Furthermore, when serving you in a fiduciary capacity, such as a trustee, Hancock often observes limitations on sharing Confidential Information that are stricter than those set forth below.

**_Sharing Information Within Hancock_**

In order to provide you with greater access to financial products and services, Hancock shares Confidential Information between Affiliates within our corporate family, which includes financial service providers such as Hancock Bank and Hancock Bank of Louisiana, Hancock Mortgage Company, Hancock Investments, Inc., Hancock Insurance Company, Harrison Life Insurance Company, and Harrison Finance Company. To this end, Hancock may share amongst these Affiliates all the Confidential Information that we collect as more fully explained in that section titled "Collecting and Using Confidential Information To Service Your Needs." However, you can opt out of Hancock’s sharing some, but not all, Confidential Information with our Affiliates as discussed in greater detail later in this notice.

**_Sharing Information Outside Hancock_**

Hancock does not sell Confidential Information about you to nonaffiliated third parties. 

However, as do many other financial institutions, Hancock selects service companies to perform support services for us ­ such as marketing assistance, or work on our behalf to provide services to you ­ such as printing your checks. Hancock also may enter into joint marketing agreements with other financial institutions to make available to you a greater range of financial products and services than Hancock alone can offer. Hancock discloses to such service providers and joint marketers Confidential Information they need in order to render such support services or to jointly market financial services. However, to this end, Hancock may disclose any or all of the information that we collect as described in that section titled "Collecting and Using Confidential Information To Service Your Needs." Hancock carefully chooses such service providers and joint marketers and requires them to comply with standards of security and confidentiality equal to those set forth in this policy and prohibits them from disclosing or using any Confidential Information solely for their own purposes.

Hancock may also disclose Confidential Information about you to nonaffiliated third parties when permitted or required by law.

We will adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice even in the event that our customer relationship with you is discontinued. 

**_Your Opportunity To Opt Out Of Our Sharing Certain Information With Our Affiliates_**

**_Under The Fair Credit Reporting Act_**

**_Information We Can Share With Our Affiliates ­ Unless You Tell Us Not To ­_**

  * Information we obtain from an application for credit, such as your income and marital status;
  * Information we obtain from a consumer report, such as your credit score or credit history;
  * Information we obtain to verify representations made by you, such as your open lines of credit; and
  * Information we obtain from a person regarding employment, credit or other relationship with you, such as your employment history.



**_Shared With Whom_**

Affiliates within our corporate family that may receive this information include financial service providers such as banks, mortgage bankers, securities broker-dealers and insurance companies.

**_How To Tell Us Not To Share This Information With Our Affiliates_**

If you prefer that we do not share this information with our Affiliates, you may opt out of this sharing, that is, you may direct us not to share this information by calling us toll free at 1-888-416-4502. Also, you may write us at Hancock Bank, Attn: Privacy Officer, Post Office Box 4019, Gulfport, MS 39502 and provide us with your name, address and social security number.

Note: Your direction to opt out only covers certain information about you that we might otherwise share with our Affiliates. Even if you opt out, we may share other information about you with our Affiliates as permitted by law, such as information related to your transactions or other experiences with us. 

**_Joint Customers_**

If two or more customers jointly obtain a financial product or service from us (joint customers), we treat an opt out instruction by one joint customer as applying to that joint customer only. Each joint customer may make a separate choice but any customer can opt out on behalf of the other joint customers. A customer’s opt out (including an opt out made on customer¹s behalf by a joint customer) will apply to all accounts that he or she maintains with any Hancock Affiliate.

Please note that third parties may obtain information about you from sources other than and independent of Hancock, such as from credit reporting agencies or public documents or records. Mailings and other solicitations based on such information are outside of Hancock’s control.

**_Web Site Privacy_**

At Hancock Bank, we take the issue of privacy very seriously. We want to assure visitors to our Web site the security, privacy and confidentiality that they expect from a premier financial services institution. You can be sure that our commitment to protect your financial information will continue under the principles and online guidelines described below. 

**Information Collected General**  
Hancock Bank does not collect any personal information from anyone who is merely visiting or browsing its Web site. Personal information may be requested if the visitor chooses to respond to online surveys, send Hancock Bank an e-mail message, apply for products and services online, or use Hancock Bank's on-line banking product. 

**E-mail and Product Inquiry**  
Through use of a "Contact Us" feedback form, Hancock Bank invites visitors on its Web sites to send e-mail messages to Hancock Bank so that Hancock Bank may respond to inquiries regarding Hancock Bank or its products or services. Hancock Bank retains copies of these e-mail messages. The information provided by a visitor will only be used to respond to the visitor's inquiry and to provide better customer service. If Hancock Bank thinks that a particular Hancock Bank account or service might apply to you or serve your needs, then Hancock Bank may occasionally contact you at your e-mail address to inform you of the potential benefits and availability of such accounts or services. Unless otherwise stated, all e-mail inquiries initiated from Hancock Bank’s web site by the user are assumed to be non-secured and therefore may be transmitted in the "open" over the Internet. 

**Applications for Products and Services**  
Through its Web site, Hancock Bank offers opportunities to apply for various products and services online, such as PC banking and brokerage services. Visitors who choose to apply for such products and services provide personal information Hancock Bank needs to process the application. To protect the confidentiality of the information submitted, Hancock Bank uses secure socket layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology establishes a "secure" Internet session and encodes the data submitted to the Hancock Bank Web site, ensuring that the information is accessible only to an authorized Hancock Bank representative and the customer. To support SSL, customers must have an Internet browser that supports state-of-the-art 128-bit "strong" encryption, such as Netscape 2.0 and higher, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 and higher, and AOL 3.0 (Windows). A customer can tell whether a document comes from a secure server by looking at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a secure server. After you have submitted an application online, Hancock Bank recommends that you end your browser session before leaving your computer. 

** Protecting Your Bank Online  
**When you bank online with Hancock Bank, we, along with our third-party service providers who bring these services to you, have access to your information. Information is retained on our system or the system of the appropriate third-party service provider, depending upon what is required to serve your needs. We use state-of-the-art Internet technology, supported by the third-party service providers that we work with, to make online banking secure and to protect your personal information. We also require an I.D. and password to access your accounts. If you do not provide this information, we cannot establish an online banking service for you. You can also help maintain the security of your banking information by not sharing your ID or password with anyone, by changing your password regularly, and by remembering to sign off. 

** Planning Tools Do Not Capture Personal Data  
**There are many planning tools throughout this Site to help you make the financial decisions that are right for you in the privacy of your home. We encourage you to try all of our "what-if" scenarios as often as you like. When you use various planning tools on our Site, the calculations run on your computer or our server. We do not capture the personal information that you provide using these planning tools. 

**Applications for Employment**  
Hancock Bank offers visitors to its Web site the opportunity to inquire about employment opportunities posted on the Web site. When enabled, applicants may also submit online resumes on the Web site. The information submitted is used solely to evaluate prospective candidates and to communicate regarding an open position. 

**Transactional Services**  
Within its web-site, Hancock Bank collects personal information necessary to complete transactions or provide data requested by the visitor (for example, account balances and check clearance dates). To protect the confidentiality of the information submitted, Hancock Bank requires that visitors have a browser that supports 128-bit "strong" encryption, i.e., Netscape 2.0 and higher, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 and higher and AOL 3.0 (Windows). 

**Use of Cookies**
