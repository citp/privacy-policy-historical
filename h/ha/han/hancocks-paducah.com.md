# Privacy Policy

  
We created this policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to ensuring your privacy. That's why, when you visit [www.hancocks-paducah.com](https://web.archive.org/index.aspx), we help you maintain control over your personal data on the Internet. If any of your concerns regarding privacy are not addressed here, you can Contact Us with any additional questions. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Internet site.

**What information do we collect and how is it used?**

_Order Processing_  
When you place an order with us, we need to know your name, mailing address, email address, credit card number, and expiration date in order to process your order and communicate with you regarding the status of your order. We may also use this information to notify you of special offers that we think may be of interest to you. If you are a registered user at **www.hancocks-paducah.com** and do not wish to receive this information, visiting [My Account](https://web.archive.org/members/MyAccount.aspx) and Selecting Check Sign-In Information to change your preferences. If you are not a registered user, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/content--i-12) to remove your name from our mailing list.

_Gift Orders_  
If you are ordering a gift that needs to be shipped to an address other than your own, we also need to know the name and address of the gift recipient in order to process and ship the order. This information will be used primarily to fulfill the order and, if necessary, communicate with the gift recipient about the status of the order. The gift recipient or the ship to address will be flagged as such and we do not intend to send promotional materials to such addresses. 

_Customer Registration_  
Our registration form requires customer contact information, which we use to process subsequent orders without asking you to re-enter it. If you choose to register at **www.hancocks-paducah.com** , we require that you provide your name, mailing address, email address, a login name, a password, and a password hint. Optional items requested during the registration process are day and evening telephone numbers and fax number. By registering once, your subsequent visits will be even easier and more personal. When you sign in as a registered user, you'll be able to track the status of your order. When you check out, you will not have to fill in most of the required fields.

With your permission, we may also use this information periodically to send you information about our company, either by email or standard mail. This may include announcements about new features at our site or special offers that we think may be of interest to you. After you register and place an order using a check or credit card, with your permission, we may allow reputable third parties to provide you with offers we think you will find interesting. Unless you have ordered, we will not provide your registration information to any 3rd party, even if you have requested such offers. If you determine that you do not wish to receive this information, simply visit [My Account](https://web.archive.org/members/MyAccount.aspx) and select Update Profile to change your preferences.

_Children Under the Age of 13_  
Like you, we at [www.hancocks-paducah.com](https://web.archive.org/index.aspx) are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1 998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.
