How Hanesbrands Protects your PII
* ### How HanesBrands Protects Your PII

We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your PII. However, no e-commerce solution, website, database, or system is completely secure or "hacker proof." As such, you are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your PII against unauthorized disclosure or misuse. 

Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' PII and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use "spoofed" e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging PII such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and Social Security numbers. 

WE DO NOT SEND E-MAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SUCH EXAMPLES OF PII OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such e-mail communication, please forward it immediately to [consumer.privacy@hanes.com](mailto:consumer.privacy@hanes.com) and then immediately delete the fraudulent e-mail from your computer.

How your PII is shared with third parties
* ### How Your PII is Shared with Third Parties

HanesBrands respects your privacy and, accordingly, shares PII with third parties in a limited number of circumstances:

  * **Affiliates:** We may share your PII within the HanesBrands family of companies for marketing and/or other administrative purposes.
  * **Third-Parties:** We may contract with other companies to provide certain services to us, including credit card processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, changing mailing addresses, market research, promotions management, database management, and advertising and promotion management. These third-party service providers may have access to PII or non-PII in order to perform their functions, but they may not use this information for other purposes. These companies are prohibited from using your PII for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with others, but we cannot guarantee security of PII and are not liable for misuse of it by others. 

We also use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (such as banners, links, etc.) on our behalf, whether displayed on the Site or elsewhere on the Internet. These advertising service providers may use Cookies to collect non-identifiable information about your visits to the Site. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, e-mail address, or other PII; but it may, in some cases, include your IP address. In addition to the information about your visits to the Site, our service providers may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from us. 




Our advertising partners, may use third-party Cookies on our site. In the future, we may partner with other entities that will provide us with interest-based advertising (displayed on the Site or elsewhere on the Internet). For more information about interest-based advertising and for a link to a tool that will enable you to manage third-party advertising preferences, see the Managing Your Preferences: Interest-Based AdvertisingJump down to Managing Your Preferences section, below. 

HanesBrands may share your PII with third parties (companies and organizations) under the following circumstances:

  * **Purposes authorized by you:** When you have requested or authorized such sharing (e.g., payment processing, delivery of goods and services, participating in HanesBrands sponsored programs, if you create a "My Favorites" list and elect to make it available to the public) 
  * **Promotional offers:** Although we do not rent customers' e-mail addresses to third parties, we may rent to non-affiliated third parties (for their own marketing or promotional uses) the names and postal addresses of customers that have ordered our products through the Site. The Managing Your PreferencesJump down to Managing Your Preferences section of this Notice discusses ways that you can modify your promotional and marketing preferences. 
  * **Co-Sponsored events:** We sometimes work with an unaffiliated co-sponsor to provide certain contests, sweepstakes, promotions and other offerings to our consumers. We will let you know if an event or promotion is co-sponsored (for example, by prominently displaying the co-sponsor's name and/or logo on applicable pages on the Site). As part of a co-sponsored event, we may provide the co-sponsor with information (including PII) that is necessary to facilitate the event. In these circumstances, our co-sponsor will have the right to use any PII received from us for its own purposes, and such uses would then be subject to the co-sponsor's own terms of use and Notice. We are not responsible for how our co-sponsors may use your PII that we share in connection with a co-sponsored event. 
  * **Social media platforms:** If you choose to connect your ID (see [Terms of Use:RegistrationTerms of use registration](https://web.archive.org/web/20190307213606id_/https%3A//www.hanes.com/shop/hanes/TermsOfUse#tou-registration)) with a Social Media Platform or use your credentials on it to register or log in to the Site, we will ask you for your permission to access your data on the Social Media Platform to create a Site account. 
  * **Protecting our interests; legal compliance:** We may disclose information we collect when we believe disclosure is appropriate in order to comply with the law, to enforce or apply applicable terms and conditions and other agreements, and/or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our consumers, or others. If some or all of our business assets are sold or transferred, we may transfer the corresponding information regarding our consumers. We also may retain a copy of such transferred consumer information. 
  * **Aggregated information:** We may share with third parties certain aggregate information (that is, information that does not directly identify an individual). This allows us to give you a more personalized experience when you use the Site. 



Remember that this Notice only applies to information collected through the Site. It is possible that our policies relating to information collected at our retail locations or through our mail order catalog may permit us to share PII in different circumstances, even if that information has also been collected through the Site pursuant to this Notice.

* ### Cross-Border Data Transfer of Your PII
