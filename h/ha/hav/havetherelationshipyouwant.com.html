    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Read very carefully:</p>
    <h2>Who do we contact?</h2>
    <p>Have The Relationship You Want
					only contacts individuals who specifically request that
					we do so or in the event that they have signed up to
					receive our free newsletters or have purchased one of our products.
					</p>
    <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>Have The Relationship You Want collects information in two categories:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="def-dash">
      <li>name and e-mail address - provided by you for
					registration to receive our free newsletters.</li>
      <li>name, postal address, phone and credit card
					information -  provided by you when purchasing our
					products. </li>
      <li>demographic information - used to improve our
					marketing, products and services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All such information is strictly protected and used only for
				delivering the content and products the user has signed up for or
				purchased, or for finding other men and women who may find our
				information valuable. This information is NEVER used for other purposes and is
				NEVER shared with 3rd parties for their own use.</p>
    <p>There is a single exception to this. Say you were subscribed to
				some newsletter such as "modern world fashion" and the editors ran
				a promotion of our site within it, and you followed over to our site,
				then subscribed to our newsletter, then at a later date you
				unsubscribed.</p>
    <p>In that case, we have to provide back to "modern world fashion"
				your email address, so they can exclude you from our future mailings.
				No other information other than email address is provided and that
				email address is used ONLY to suppress our future emails to you.
				This scenario accounts for less than 1% of our newsletter subscribers.</p>
    <p>A note about demographic information:</p>
    <p>We contract with information providers that help us better understand
				people visiting our sites and advertise to those who find our content relevant. We may share
				PII with such companies provided that they have explicit policies to not share
				our data with any other parties and solely for the purpose of helping us understand
				our customers better. This technique is also called “database marketing”. It is
				practiced by virtually every US corporation. Every US consumer can
				assume that there is a fair amount of available data about them,
				including personal data such as buying preferences and education level.</p>
    <p>There is no central “opt out” place that we are
				aware of. There are efforts underway to reach a standard that
				would apply automatically based on browser settings.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the state of privacy as a whole, you can avoid
				us finding out extra demographic information about you by doing
				the following:</p>
    <p> 1. email us using our <a href="../contact.html">
				contact page</a></p>
    <p> 2. in the subject line write: “Privacy -
				opt out of demographic information”</p>
    <p> 3. make sure you enter the same email that
				you provided as customer or subscriber	</p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Anonymous Usage History (non PII)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>This information is strictly limited to the  history of activities
				that the user engaged in while on our site.  it does NOT include any
				personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
    <p>For example, the string "sub+customer" in a cookie (see below for
				what cookies are) might indicate that you are both a subscriber AND
				a customer.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this information is to improve your experience.</p>
    <p>For example, by storing the fact that you are already a subscriber,
				we do not need to bother you with an irrelevant  subscriber box.</p>
    <p>Similarly, by noting that you are a customer, we can "bookmark"
				the last video frames you watched in our member area and remind you
				of this the next time you visit.</p>
    <p>There is a small subset of this history that we use with 3rd
				parties, such as Google, for the purpose of measuring and improving
				the efficacy of advertising campaigns.</p>
    <p>Some of these third parties, aggregate such information across
				many websites. This allows them to identify users who are  more likely
				to be interested in specific offerings like fashion, sports, education
				and so on.</p>
    <p>As an Internet user, you may experience the results of such
				aggregation by noticing how the ads displayed on Yahoo, for example,
				better match your  interests (the optimistic scenario), or at least
				more closely match a website that you recently visited.</p>
    <p>Whether you find this annoying and spooky or helpful and relevant,
				or perhaps both, you are in good company. This area of Internet advertising
				is new and controversial. The tradeoff between privacy vs. commercial
				efficiency has a long history, for example the "Do not call" list.</p>
    <p>In any event, it is likely that either the government or the industry
				will adopt some form of "opt out" capability in the future to address
				these concerns.</p>
    <h2>What are cookies/clear GIFs and how
				do we use them?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many other commercial sites, our site
				utilizes standard technologies called "cookies" and clear GIFs to collect
				information about how our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file,
				which a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your web browser
				permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were
				designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor
				and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the
				user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than
				the one that set the cookie. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus or
				capture any of the Personally Identifiable information.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Clear GIFs:</strong> At times, we work with third-party service
				partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs,
				web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising
				effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
				in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our
				users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible
				on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of
				this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information
				and only track the visitor traffic and behavior to and on our Site.</p>
    <p>Clear GIFs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both
				from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if
				a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear
				GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising
				company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer.
				This collected information can be shared with the advertising company. We do,
				at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising service partners,
				but that information never includes personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h2>How do we store your email information?</h2>
    <p>Your email information (email address, first name) is stored at the list
				server that delivers Have The Relationship You Want
				newsletters. Your information can only be accessed by those who help manage
				those lists in order to deliver e-mail to those who would like to receive
				Have The Relationship You Want's newsletters.</p>
    <p>All of the newsletters that are sent to you by Have The Relationship You Want
				include an unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any time from
				our newsletters by <a href="../help/unsubscribe.html">unsubscribing here</a>.</p>
    <p>If you have purchased any of my programs, you will continue to receive mailings related to
				your purchase. If you are an affiliate partner, then you will continue to receive mailings related to our affiliate program.
				If you would like to be removed from any of these mailings, please <a href="../contact.html">contact
				my support team</a> and they can assist you.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This policy may be changed at any time at Have The Relationship You Want's
				discretion. If we should update this policy, we will post the updates to this
				page on our Website. This policy was revised September 19, 2011.</p>
