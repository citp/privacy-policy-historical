# Privacy policy | Haven

## Privacy policy summary

Here at Haven, we always try to go above and beyond to give our guests a great experience. 

When planning a break with us, we do our best to make sure that you have all the information needed to find your perfect holiday. To help us do this, we need to ask for a little personal information from you. We'll either ask you for personal information directly or, with your permission, gather it by tracking how you use our website. When we do share your personal information, it's always so we can provide you with an experience that is tailored for you. 

Where we have your permission, we plan to send you Haven updates that we think will interest you, whether it be exclusive booking offers or new updates from our holiday parks. We'll also collect technical information, which helps us make sure our website is working at its best, so you can have a smooth experience when browsing. We will occasionally share information with third parties (such as business partners and service providers) so we can give you the best possible service. 

If you're going on a break with us, we'll ask you to tell us a little more about yourself, including any health conditions. We only do this so we can plan your break around any special requirements you might have. 

We keep your personal information safe and secure, and only hold onto it for a limited time. If you'd like to stop receiving our email marketing and offers, you can click 'unsubscribe' at any time. 

Please reach out to us, by emailing privacy@haven.com, if you have any questions, concerns or feedback on our privacy policy or your personal information. 

If you have any comments regarding this privacy policy or the way we handle your personal information, you can also contact the UK Information Commissioner on telephone number 0303 123 1113 or by visiting <https://ico.org.uk/>. 

From time to time, we might review our privacy policy and make changes to it. If we do this, we'll always highlight it on our website and, where appropriate, let you know by email.

  * Allow a website to work more efficiently
  * Make the site easier to navigate by remembering information you've entered
  * Customise the site by showing you information that's relevant to you



Cookies set by the website owner are called 'first party cookies'. Cookies that have been set by parties other than the website owner are called 'third party cookies'.

 **Why do we use them?**

We use cookies to improve your website experience and to tailor it to your needs.

 **What you need to know about the types of cookies that we use**  

  1.  **Necessary** – these help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without these cookies and therefore cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. 
  2.  **Preferences** – these cookies enable a website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly. 
  3.  **Statistics** – these cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources and improve performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. Statistical/performance cookies do not collect personal data. 
  4.  **Marketing** – these cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you switch these cookies off at browser level you will experience less targeted advertising. 



Our lawful basis for collecting your personal information by using cookies is our 'legitimate interest' to develop and market our services. We believe that users of our websites have reasonable expectations that cookies will be collected and that you can opt out using browser settings. 

 **Third Party Cookies**  

Some of the cookies on our website are not related to Haven and are placed by our advertising partners and other Third Parties.

 **Google Marketing Platform**  

The website uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, Google Marketing Platform.

The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with Google. With both cookies and pixels, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
