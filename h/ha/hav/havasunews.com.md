TODAY'S NEWS-HERALD may use information collected from visitors in the following ways:

    * To improve existing features or develop new features, products and services by analyzing how site features are being used.  
    * To award prizes in contests or promotions. Participation in some contests or promotions may require visitors to agree to be contacted by TODAY'S NEWS-HERALD.  
    * To provide advertisers or other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. Personally identifiable information is kept private and not distributed to third parties.

TODAY'S NEWS-HERALD will not knowingly collect any personal information from individuals under 13 years of age without parental consent. Where appropriate, TODAY'S NEWS-HERALD will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our site and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent to such submission.

Parental consent will be required in the event TODAY'S NEWS-HERALD provides a feature or event such as a contest or promotion that requires submission of information by children. Notice may be provided in a number of ways, including sending an e-mail message or notice by postal mail. At any time, you may write to us at [quinn@havasunews.com](mailto:manuel.coppola@nogalesinternational.com) to request a summary of any information we have retained as part of such activities or to ask that it be deleted.

Parents should be aware that TODAY'S NEWS-HERALD's Privacy Policy will govern our use of personal data, but that information which is voluntarily given by children (or others) in chat sessions, e-mail exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited mail. TODAY'S NEWS-HERALD encourages all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their personal data while using the Internet.
