Finally, you should also know that we sometimes collect information exclusively for our internal purposes about how people came to the Hasbro site and how long they stay. This information, however, does not include any personal information about you, only how you came to the Hasbro site, which pages you visited, and how long you stayed. We do not know who you are unless you tell us, and we do not use this information beyond improving our own sites.

### HASBRO WEB SITE PRIVACY STATEMENT

Welcome to the Hasbro Web site! If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in knowing more about Hasbro's policy regarding the online collection of information from children, we recommend reviewing the Note To Parents below. 

**WELCOME!**

This Hasbro Web site brings you the coolest information about the world of Hasbro and provides a first hand look at some of our games and toys. 

Hasbro wants to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible. To help us figure out what you like and don't like about our sites, we may ask for your opinion from time to time. You may also be asked whether you would like to receive information about new Hasbro products. If you are under the age of 13, you will need your parent or guardian's consent before you can provide this information. If at any time you do not want to receive new product information from us, let us know, and we'll stop. 

We sometimes collect information to find out how people found the Hasbro site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. This information does not include any personal information about you. We don't know who you are unless you tell us, and you don't have to tell us if you don't want to. We just need to know this stuff so we can keep making this site better and better! 

Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this site, ask your parent or guardian for help. 

Hasbro may use "cookies" to enhance your experience at our Web site. Cookies are pieces of information that we may place on your computer to help "personalize" your visit to the site. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things about you, such as your screen name or where you left off in a game. Most major Web sites use cookies exactly for this purpose. A cookie tells us nothing more than what you choose to tell us. We can not tell who you are or where you are. The cookie only tells us that you have visited the site before and may contain certain information that will help us make your visit more enjoyable. Hasbro will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. 

To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. Please do not use your real name for these promotions. For other Hasbro promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. Remember, children under 13 years of age will need their parent or guardian's permission before providing this information. 

Hasbro will not share any information provided by you with any other person or company without permission. Hasbro may in the future request information from you that may be shared with others. In these situations, you will be told of this fact, and given an opportunity to say no. We respect your privacy and your choice not to have your personal information shared with other people. 

We reserve the right to change this statement at any time, so visit this page from time to time to check for changes. For additional information about our Web site, please see our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/19981202133743id_/http%3A//www.hasbro.com/home/terms.html) of Use. Thanks. Have fun!
