# Privacy Policy

Hashnode, operated by LinearBytes Inc., located at 8 The Green, Suite #4582, Dover, DE 19901 ("Hashnode," "we," or "our"), recognizes the importance of your personal privacy. Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy so that you know how we use and disclose your information when you make it available to us. The Privacy Policy below discloses our practices regarding information collection and usage for the website located at hashnode.com and the related mobile website (collectively, the "Websites"), and the service provided thereon (the "Service").

By using or accessing the Websites and the Service, you signify your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SERVICE OR PARTICIPATE IN OUR SERVICES.

Key aspects of our privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy include the following explanations:

  * The information we collect and why we collect it;
  * How we use that information;
  * How we share information; and
  * The choices we offer.



## Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy only applies to your use of Our Site and does not extend to any websites that are referenced by to linked to from Our Site, whether by Us or another user. Your use of any other websites is subject to that website’s privacy policy and we have no control over how your data is collected, used, or stored by other websites. You are advised to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing data to them.

## Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect:

We may ask you for, or you may voluntarily submit, personally identifiable information when you are using the Service. The personally identifiable information which you may provide to us could include, but is not limited to:

  * Your name
  * Your contact information (including, without limitation, address and email address);
  * Your payment information; and
  * Any other personal information that is necessary to perform the actions requested by the user.



## Non-Personal Or Aggregate Information That We Collect:

When you access our Service, we may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information from you, such as IP host address, web pages viewed, browser type, operating system, referring service, search information, device type, page views, usage and browsing habits on the Service and similar data. We may also aggregate demographic information collected from our users (such as the number of users in a particular geographical location) in a manner which does not identify any one individual. We may also aggregate information collected offline in connection with the Service, obtain non-personally identifiable information from third party sources and develop aggregate information by anonymizing previously collected personally identifiable information.

It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable information through automatic means that we may unintentionally collect or receive personally identifiable information that is mixed in with the non-personally identifiable information. While we will make reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data collection, the possibility still exists. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected your personal information, please notify us at [hello@hashnode.com](mailto:hello@hashnode.com).

## Information Usage:

We will only use your personally identifiable information as described below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use, either at the time the personally identifiable information is collected from you or through some other form of consent from you or notification to you:

  * We may share your personally identifiable information collected in connection with providing the Service, including sharing your data with other companies in Our group, including holding companies or subsidiaries.
  * We may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your inquires or requests.
  * With your permission or where permitted by law, We may use your personally identifiable information to send you emails from time to time about our services, but we will not provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for them to contact you directly unless otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy or you provide your consent. We will not, however, send you any unsolicited marketing or spam and for users located in Europe, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that We fully protect your rights and comply with Our obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, as amended in 2004, 2011 and 2015.
  * We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties (collectively, the "Third Party Vendors") to further the purpose for which you provided such information to us. For example, we may share your information our email platform, for the purpose of sending emails or with other vendors for the purposes of payment processing, delivery of goods, search engine facilities, advertising and marketing. In some cases, the third parties may require access to some or all of your data. Where any of your data is required for such a purpose, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, Our obligations, and the obligations of the third party under the law. **We urge you to read the privacy practices of all of our Third Party Vendors before submitting any personally identifiable information through the Service.**
  * We may disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or legal process. For example, where We are involved in legal proceedings, where We are complying with the requirements of legislation, a court order, or a governmental authority. We do not require any further consent from you in order to share your data in such circumstances and will comply as required with any legally binding request that is made of Us.
  * We may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, or the terms or policies for our services or our sponsors.
  * We may transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with the sale or merger or change of control of Hashnode or the division responsible for the services with which your personally identifiable information is associated. In the event of a sale, merger, or transfer, the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this Privacy Policy, be permitted to use the data for the purposes for which it was originally collected by Us. In the event that any of your data is to be transferred in such a manner, you may not be contacted in advance or informed of the changes. 
  * We may share your personally identifiable information with an affiliate of Hashnode who is in the same corporate family as us as long as their privacy practices are substantially similar to ours.
