This Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services where this Policy is posted (collectively, the "Services").</p><p>This Privacy Policy and the ESRB certification seals shown on our websites confirm that Hasbro is a valid licensee, and participating member, of the <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp" target="_blank">Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Certified Program</a> (“ESRB”). To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and have had all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection and use practices. As a licensee of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB. If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in knowing more about Hasbro's policy regarding the collection of information from children, we recommend reviewing the <a href="#parents">Note to Parents</a> below.</p><p>We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time and will indicate when changes have been made by revising the date at the top of this Policy. Your use of the Services, or any portion thereof, following the posting of such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. We encourage you to review this Policy whenever you access the Services to make sure that you understand our information collection, use and disclosure practices. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will provide you with additional notice of such changes and request your affirmative consent before using or sharing previously collected information in a materially different way. If we make material changes to how we use personal information collected from children under 13, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain verifiable consent for the new uses of the child's personal information.</p><h3>What information does Hasbro collect?</h3><h4>Information That You Provide</h4><p>Hasbro may collect information that you provide when you use the Services, such as when you: (1) create an account; (2) make a purchase; (3) participate in contests, events or promotions; (4) send questions or comments via email or live chat to Hasbro customer support; (5) submit your resume to us online; (6) fill out online surveys; (7) otherwise communicate with us through the Services; or (8) provide information necessary to obtain parental consent. The types of personal information that you provide may include your name, email address, parent’s or guardian’s name, parent's or guardian’s email address, telephone number, postal address, credit card information, birth date and other contact or identifying information that you choose to provide. We may also collect your gender, toy and game ownership and preferences when you provide this information at the same time as your name or other contact or identifying information, or we may combine these data points with your personal information in the future. If you are under the age of 13, only your parent or guardian can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities. See <a href="#parents">Note to Parents</a> below for more information.</p><h4 id="information" name="information">Information We Collect Automatically From You</h4><p>When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you.

The purpose of this Policy is to help you understand some of the information contained on the Services and how the Services operate. Please discuss this Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use the Services and the information they may be asked to provide. Hasbro believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Services will inform choices and decisions about how to use the Services, and will better protect its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided below. For any other issue, please contact <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/customer-service/contacts">Hasbro Customer Service</a>.</p><h3>Children Under 13</h3><h3>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</h3><p>Hasbro may collect and store personal information about children under 13 years of age ("children" or "child") if this information is submitted by the parent or guardian in connection with any of our website registrations. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all prospective registrants to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are less than 13 years of age are taken through a parental consent process. When provided by the parent or guardian, Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Hasbro may also collect the child's mailing address when necessary to fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize. Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, toy and game ownership and other preferences, and combine such information with the child's personal information. Hasbro will only collect this information if it believes that it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child's parent or guardian. For information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section entitled <a href="#information">"What information does Hasbro collect?"</a> (above).</p><p>Once collected, a child's registration information may be used to: (a) fulfill a transaction, such as ship products that have been purchased or send the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize, or (b) send the child requested promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest (e.g., Birthday Club emails). We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies so that we can improve the products and services we provide our visitors in order to better meet their needs, or as otherwise described in this Policy. For further information, please see our section entitled <a href="#usemyinfo">"How does Hasbro use my information?"</a> (above).</p><p>Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the child's phone number) to allow the child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it. To read about the steps Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on <a href="#safeguard">"Safeguarding your personal information"</a> (above).</p><h3>Hasbro Contact Information</h3><p>Any registration information that a child provides to our Services is collected by Hasbro. Hasbro's contact information is as follows:</p><p>Hasbro, Inc.<br>Attention: Website Administrator<br>1027 Newport Avenue, Mailstop A906<br>Pawtucket, RI 02861<br>(800) 255-5516<br><a href="mailto: hasbroregistration@hasbro.com">hasbroregistration@hasbro.com</a></p><h3>Disclosure of Children's Personal Information</h3><p>We follow our standard policy <a href="#share">("With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?"
