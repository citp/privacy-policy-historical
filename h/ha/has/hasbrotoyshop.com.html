Please discuss this Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use the Services and the information they may be asked to provide.

<h3>Children Under 13</h3>
<h3>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</h3>

<p>Hasbro may collect and store personal information about children under 13 years of age ("children" or "child") if this information is submitted by the parent or guardian in connection with any of our website registrations.  To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all prospective registrants to submit their date of birth.  Those users that indicate they are less than 13 years of age are taken through a parental consent process.  When provided by the parent or guardian, Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address.  Hasbro may also collect the child's mailing address when necessary to fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize.  Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child's personal information.  Hasbro will only collect this information if it believes that it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child's parent or guardian.  For information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section on <a href="#information">(above)</a>. </p>
<p>Once collected, a child's registration information may be used to: (a) fulfill a transaction, such as ship products that have been purchased or send the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize, or (b) send the child requested promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest (e.g., Birthday Club e-mails).  We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs. </p>
<p>Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.  This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the child's phone number) to allow the child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it.  To read about the steps Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on <a href="#safeguard">"Safeguarding your personal information"</a> (above).</p>
<h3>Hasbro Contact Information</h3>

<p>(800) 255-5516</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Children's Personal Information</h3>
<p>We follow our standard policy <a href="#share">("With whom does Hasbro share my personal information" (above))</a> for the disclosure of personal information collected from and about children under 13.</p>

<h3>Parental Access</h3>
