  2. make a purchase or request to purchase a product;
  3. rate, review, or ask a question about a product;
  4. back a crowdfunded product;
  5. participate in contests, events or promotions;

Depending on the activity, the types of personal information that you provide may include:

  1. your first and/or last name;
  2. email address;
  3. telephone number;
  4. address (including billing address and/or shipping address);
  5. credit card or other payment information; and
  6. other contact or identifying information that you choose to provide.



Other information you may also provide through your use of the Services includes your product preferences, searches, and browsing activity. Standing alone, this information cannot be used to identify or directly contact you. However, this information may become personally identifiable when we combine it with your personal information.

In some cases, we also collect information you provide about others, such as when you refer someone to the Services (including promotions) or when you purchase and ship products to someone. We will use this information to fulfill your requests and will not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your requests, unless they separately consent to receive communications from us.

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies to any information that we collect (or that our service providers collect on our behalf) through your use of the Services. If the Services collect and/or share personal information in a manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the purposes for which such information will be collected and/or with whom such information will be shared (if applicable), whether via a just-in-time notification at the point of collection or via an alternate notice.

  


##### INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY FROM YOU

When you access or use the Services, we and our service providers may also automatically collect information about your visit. For example, when you visit the Site or otherwise use or interact with the Services, we collect your computer's Internet Protocol (" **IP** ") address, and may also collect other unique identifiers (e.g., ad tags), information about your hardware, operating system version, browser type and language, screen resolution, geographic location (country, state, and city level), the URL of the website you visited before navigating to the Services, and other analytics and statistical data regarding  use of the Services (e.g., downloads, number of users, access times, sessions, page views, frequency of use, retention, clicks, etc.). In addition to the above, if you access the Services via a mobile device, we may also collect your device ID, device make and model, and mobile carrier.

To collect this information, we and our service providers use various technologies, including the following:

Cookies: Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website. Among other things, cookies help us and our service providers improve the Services and personalize your experience, see which areas and features of the Services are popular, and count visits. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see the “What are my information choices?" section below.

Clear GIFs: Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or "web beacons," are small electronic images that are placed on a web page or in an email message. We use clear GIFs to monitor user behavior, deliver cookies, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and to tell if a recipient has opened and acted upon an email.

Log Files: Log files record website activity on the Services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits. These entries help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have accessed or used the Services, which pages of the Services they've visited, and other similar data.

Do Not Track (DNT) Signals: Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, our system does not support and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning collection and use of your personal information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may associate the information we collect from these technologies with other information (including personal information) that you provide for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

  


##### INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THIRD PARTIES

We and our service providers may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Services. For example, if we enable a feature on the Site that permits you to interact with a third-party social networking site, we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site.

  


##### WEBSITE ANALYTICS

We use analytics services and software provided by third parties to help us understand how users access and use the Services. These tools and services use cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies on the Services to enable them to track traffic data. The data collected typically includes information such as your IP address, your Internet Service Provider, your web browser, the time spent on web pages, and the links clicked and the advertisements viewed on those pages. We use this information to improve the Services and your experience, to see which areas and features of the Services are popular, and for which visitors, and to count visits.

##### THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING

We engage third parties to place ads for our products and services on other websites and online services. These third parties use cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies to collect information about your visits to websites and mobile applications, including Hasbro's websites and mobile applications. The data collected typically includes information such as your IP address, your web browser, web pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and whether you purchased an advertised product. These third parties use this information to deliver advertising and/or content targeted to your interests. For more information about targeted advertising provided by these third parties, and how to opt-out of having your information used in this way by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (" **DAA** ") or the Network Advertising Initiative (" **NAI** "), please visit: [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Hasbro is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their opt-out options or programs.

#### **5\. WITH WHOM DOES HASBRO SHARE MY INFORMATION?**

##### SHARING OF INFORMATION

We share information about you with others as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or through the Services, including:

  * With your consent, including if we notify you through the Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;
  * With vendors, consultants and other service providers who are working on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out their work for us. We require these entities to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us or through the Site and the Services;
  * With our affiliates for internal business purposes;
  * With our affiliates and third parties for Hasbro's own marketing purposes and those affiliates' and third parties' own business purposes, including direct marketing purposes (California residents have certain rights set forth in the section entitled "Your California Privacy Rights");
  * When we believe it is necessary or appropriate to: (i) comply with applicable law or legal process or to respond to lawful requests or legal authorities; (ii) protect the rights and property of Hasbro and our employees, agents, users and other third parties, including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use as provided on the Services, and protect against fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of the Services; and (iii) protect the safety of Hasbro, our users or any third party; and
  * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, bankruptcy or reorganization, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.



We may also share aggregated information or information that we have collected from you through the Services, including on co-branded pages and where we have taken reasonable measures to de-identify such information.

  


##### SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES

The Services (including content and functionality on or features of the Services provided by our service providers) may offer third party social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook and Twitter widgets), which let you share actions you take on the Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides these features. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features.

  


##### LINKING TO EXTERNAL SITES, APPLICATIONS, AND OTHER ONLINE SERVICES

To provide relevant information not found on the Services and to allow you to interact with other websites, applications, and/or other online services with which you may have accounts (such as Facebook and other social media sites) or which may be of interest to you, Hasbro may provide links or embed applications on the Services that allow you to login to or otherwise engage with online services not operated or controlled by Hasbro. Your use of these online services is subject to the third parties' privacy policies and terms of use, and we encourage you to read the third parties' privacy policies and terms of use before submitting personal or other information or using their online services.

  


##### MATCHED LIST ADS

Third party websites and applications may display ads from Hasbro that are targeted to reach people on those websites or applications who are also identified on one of more of Hasbro's databases. This is done by matching common factors between Hasbro's databases and the databases of these third parties. For instance, we may share your email address with Facebook as part of Facebook's matched list ad services. If we use Facebook's matched list ad services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of the Facebook ad to find out how to opt-out with us from such list. If you opt-out with us from Facebook matched list ad services, we will remove the matching personal information from that Facebook list; however, this will not take effect immediately and if you have multiple emails or other accounts, you may have to opt-out separately for each one. We are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions.

##### REGARDING PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

We may send you promotional communications if you sign up to receive them through the Services.

You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails or mail from Hasbro by declining to receive such communications when you place an order or at the time you otherwise provide your contact information to us. You may also opt-out of receiving promotional emails at any time by following the instructions to “unsubscribe” in those emails or by sending an email to [CustomerService@HasbroPulse.com](mailto:CustomerService@HasbroPulse.com).

#### **7\. SECURITY**

Hasbro has established policies in an effort to protect your personal information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and/or destruction. For example, Hasbro strives to provide only those employees performing a legitimate business function with access to users' personal information. Hasbro also reviews its security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.

Hasbro retains your information for business purposes, for as long as your account is active, and/or as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with our products and services. Hasbro will also retain your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a reasonable period of time.

Despite our efforts, please be aware that no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. To that end, Hasbro will notify users of a data breach when Hasbro determines that is reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable law.
