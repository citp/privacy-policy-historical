A. _Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_

We may use “cookies”, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect or receive information about you, including pages and content viewed.  Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  We may use these tracking technologies to enable certain features and functionalities of our Sites to remember you and your preferences, to track your use of our Sites, to serve targeted ads, and to provide content to users.  Some tracking technologies used on our Sites may be implemented and controlled by third-party partners.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, and some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. We do not respond to these “Do Not Track” signals, but you can modify and control your own browser setting to decline cookies, or to indicate when they are being used.  If you choose to opt-out of these tracking technologies some features of our Sites may not function properly.

B. _Embedded Scripts_

We may use embedded scripts, which are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded into your device from our web server or a third-party service provider.  Third-party services may use this code to track your interactions across sites where their embedded script is deployed, including third party sites.
