Last Updated on July 12, 2019

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to services provided by Hackernoon  (“we”, “us”, or “Company”) and our website, mobile app, or other platform (collectively, the “Services”) explains what information we collect from users of our Services (a “user”, “you”, or “your”), including information that may be used to personally identify you (“Personal Information”) and how we use it. We encourage you to read the details below. This Policy applies to any user or visitor to or user of our Services. We will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with, our Services.

We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. We will notify you of any changes to this Policy by sending notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by a prominent notice on our website. Significant changes will go into effect thirty (30) days following such notification. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately. You should periodically check our website, including this privacy page, for updates. You acknowledge that your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Policy means that the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information is subject to the updated Policy.

What Information Do We Collect?

We will only collect and process Personal Information about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Services you have requested)) and “legitimate interests”.

We collect information that you give us when you create an account, contact us, or otherwise access or use our Services, any information you voluntarily submit to us or publicly sourced information, and information regarding how you use the Services. Specifically, the foregoing includes: 

  * Your internet protocol address (i.e., IP address) and, if you access the Services from a mobile application, your unique mobile device ID number and non-email authentication.
  * Your name, email address, postal address, employment information, credit card information, telephone number, profession, date of birth, profile picture, your responses to surveys that we may ask you to complete for research purposes or to help direct Company activities, the contact information of your representative, your social media account information
  * Details of any financial transactions you participate in on the Services, including the amount, currency, and method of payment.
  * Browser and device information and information collected through technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies.   
  * If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.



How Do We Use The Information We Collect?

We use the information we collect to:

  * Deliver and improve the Services and your overall user experience.
  * To protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity.
  * To link or combine user information with other Personal Information.
  * To compare and verify information for accuracy and update our records.
  * Email, text, message, or otherwise contact you with information and updates about us and the Services 
  * To send you information including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages.
  * Analyze how you use the Services with tools such as Google Analytics and other tools to help us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with the Services.
  * Create targeted advertising to promote the Services and engage our users.  



Do We Share Your Personal Information?

We do not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with other people or non-affiliated third parties except with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized. 

To help us do our work, we may provide limited access to some of your Personal Information to the following third parties:

  * Partners: Sometimes we collaborate with other organizations to deliver the Services. In these cases, we may share your name, contact information and other details you provided when making an account with our partners. 
  * Service Providers: We work with a wide range of third party providers, notably our database administrators, cloud computing services, advertising services, data analysts, application service providers, bulk SMS services, and other non-governmental organizations. 
  * Payment processors:  We work with payment processors such as Stripe to help process credit card transactions and other payment methods made through the Services. These payment processors will store certain information about you. Please refer to their privacy policies to learn more about how they use your Personal Information.



We may store information such as names, email addresses, profession, employment information, credit card information, date of birth, telephone number, profile picture, user survey responses, third party social media account information (e.g. Facebook, Google), and postal address in our databases and Hubspot.  We may store any information that is necessary to enable us to operate effectively and deliver our services to you. We may also transfer your Personal Information to a third party as a result of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or similar transaction; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of the Services; and to protect the rights or property of Company. In such event, and to the extent legally permitted, we will notify you and, if there are material changes in relation to the processing of your Personal Information, give you an opportunity to consent to such changes. 

Protection of Company and Others

We will also share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to detect or protect against fraud or security issues, enforce our terms of use, meet any enforceable government request, defend against legal claims, or protect against harm our legal rights or safety.

How Do We Use Tracking Technologies?

A "cookie" is a small file placed on your hard drive by some of our web pages.   We, or third parties we do business with, may use cookies to help us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them in our Services.

You may delete and block all cookies from our Services, but parts of the Services may not work. We want to be open about our cookie use.

Even if you are only browsing the Services, certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details, and the time of accessing the Services) is automatically collected about you. This information will be collected every time you access the Services and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

You can reduce the information cookies collected from your device.  An easy way of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser. If you do that you should know that (a) your use of the Services may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our and other sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site: www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.  Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will send cookies as soon as access our Services.  By using the Services you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.  

Web beacons may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow. Our third-party advertising service providers may also use web beacons to recognize you when you visit the Site or access the Services and to help determine how you found the  Services. If you would like more information about this and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit: the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website, [http://www.aboutads.info/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aboutads.info/&sa=D&ust=1562950545898000), or the Network Advertising Initiative’s website, [http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp&sa=D&ust=1562950545899000).

Session replay technologies, such as FullStory, Inc., may be used to collect information regarding visitor behavior on the Service.

How Do We Secure Your Personal Information?

We take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse, or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. If you have an account with us, you are responsible for keeping your membership details confidential. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your Personal Information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your Personal Information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.

We retain your personal data while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of the Services.
