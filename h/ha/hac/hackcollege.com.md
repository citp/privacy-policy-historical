# Privacy Policy - HackCollege

_Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for Use of HackCollege (Effective January 22, 2016)_

Thank you for visiting HackCollege and using our website content and services. This page explains the conditions under which you may utilize our website, and the way in which HackCollege gathers and uses different information to provide our content and related products and services. By using our website, you are agreeing to these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

## Types of Information Collected

### Submitted Information

In order to provide the services that our visitors request, we provide web forms for the voluntary submission of personal contact information (such as name, telephone number, email address and mailing address), as well as any other information needed to match you to an education-related product or service. The information you submit is collected, stored and shared with schools, programs and other services relevant to education.

Submitting this information authorizes HackCollege and our affiliated schools and partners to contact you in accordance with all applicable laws by telephone, text messages, email or mail regarding education options or related subjects. However, if you receive any email communication from us, a third party or a school, you will be able to unsubscribe through a link provided in the email. At this point, you’ll be removed from further mailings from that sender.

### Automatic information

HackCollege receives and stores certain types of anonymous information whenever you interact with us. This may include, but is not limited, to your browser version, operating system version and IP address. This information is used for improving and creating a better user experience. We use “cookies” to collect this anonymous data for site optimization, analytics and advertising and marketing purposes. 

By using our website, you acknowledge and agree that information collected on HackCollege may be shared with schools, affiliated companies and third parties, and to allow us to provide you with information regarding degrees, programs and other education related products and services. Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that we retain the right to release any information that we collect, including personally identifiable information, as needed, to businesses providing our company with administration services, such as email service delivery.

By submitting any personal information to HackCollege, you are granting permission for us, our affiliates, including schools, third party marketing partners and vendors to contact you. This may be via telephone, text messages, mail or email for purposes of providing information, including marketing, for education related products and services. You also grant us, our affiliates and partners and vendors the right to contact you for a period of time and relinquish any rights granted by the Do Not Call list or other applicable law. Your submission serves as an omission to the Do Not Call requirements established by state and federal governments and may exempt us from other applicable laws.

Additionally, we retain the right to release your personal information when required by law. For example, in the case of abiding by a subpoena or other legal procedure, when, in good faith, we believe it necessary to preserve our rights, ensure the safety of you or others, explore alleged fraud, to reply to a government or legal request, and/or in the instance that HackCollege is merging, acquisitioning or selling some or all of its assets to a third party.
