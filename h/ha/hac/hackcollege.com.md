# Privacy Policy - HackCollege

HackCollege.com’s privacy policy serves to explain to its users what personal information we collect, why we collect it, and under what circumstances we will share it. If any of our information rules change, we may update this policy to display those changes. We urge you to check our privacy policy from time to time so that you can maintain a current knowledge of our information practices. 

#### Information HackCollege.com Collects 

While using HackCollege.com, it is common for us to collect your contact, computer, and demographic information. This can include, but is not limited to, your home phone number, cell phone number, mailing address, first and last name, gender, income level, hobbies, operating system, IP address, and so on.

#### How HackCollege.com Uses Collected Information

This collected information is used to improve our business and services, engage in research and analysis, as well as provide you with a variety of services. More specifically, it is used to contact you in reference to: 

  * Schools that fit your needs
  * Degrees that will help you attain your career goals
  * Customer service requests
  * Questions you’ve expressed
  * Current news, services, or products related to HackCollege.com 



Additionally, HackCollege.com and its related affiliates may use this information to contact you, as your supplied personal information serves as an inquiry into our services and grants us permission to do so. This contact consent extends to contact by telephone despite your enrollment in state or federal Do Not Call lists; a query of this kind effectively excludes us and our affiliates from the requirements stipulated by all Do Not Call lists.

#### Choice/Opt-Out 

Occasionally, HackCollege.com will send you marketing communications. If you do not want to be a recipient of these communications, you may opt-out by unsubscribing; directions for doing so are located in our emails to you.

#### Information HackCollege.com Shares 

Instances in which we will share your personal information with third party companies are compliant with this privacy policy. On no occasion will HackCollege.com share your personal information with a third party to benefit its unrelated marketing undertakings. Correspondingly, HackCollege.com will only share your personal information in the following circumstances:

  * To aid in its business efforts when it contracts a third party service provider. For example, HackCollege.com may give your mailing address to a communications service it contracts to mail you a HackCollege.com newsletter.
  * If HackCollege.com ever becomes involved in the merging, acquiring, or selling of any of its business assets, it may share your information with a third party, if equipped with your former consent, when we feel doing so is necessary to protect our business, yours or others’ safety, examine a case of fraud, or adhere to a government demand.
