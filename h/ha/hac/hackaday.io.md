We take the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of the Hackaday website at [hackaday.com](http://hackaday.com/) (the “ **Site** ”), the Hackaday forums at [forums.hackaday.com](http://forums.hackaday.com/) (the “ **Forum** ”) and the services made available through the Site and Forum (together with the Site and the Forum, the “ **Services** ”) provided by Supply Frame, Inc. (“ **Supply Frame** ”, “ **us** ”, “ **our** ”, and “ **we** ”).

### 1\. User Consent.

By submitting Personal Data through our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 2\. A Note About Children.

We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13.

### 3\. A Note to Users Outside of the United States.

Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

### 4\. Types of Data We Collect.

**“Personal Data”** means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. **“Anonymous Data”** means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.

#### (a) Information You Provide to Us.

  * When you create an account (“ **Account** ”) to register for the Forum, we will collect your username, e-mail address and password. We may also collect optional information that you provide us to customize your Account, for example, your language preference, location, time zone, birthdates, occupation, interests, instant messenger ID and website. 
  * When you post a comment on the Site, we will collect your username and e-mail address and, if you provide it, your website. 
  * When you post comments or messages to the Site or Forum, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. 
  * We retain information on your behalf, such as your postings to the Site or Forum and files and messages that you store using your Account. 
  * If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. 
  * When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. 
  * We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services. 
  * We may also collect Personal Data, such as at other points in our Services that state that Personal Data is being collected. 



#### (b) Information Collected via Technology.

  * _Information Collected by Our Servers_. To make our Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, referring/exit pages, clickstream data (including the ads you see and click on), and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Site and Forum, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or Forum again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used by us to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data. 
  * _Cookies._ We store small text files called “ **Cookies** " on your computer to make your experience on our website better. We use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). In order to provide the Services, we use a variety of Cookies that perform different functions. While you will still be able to use the Supply Frame Offerings if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the Supply Frame Offerings may not function as effectively.
