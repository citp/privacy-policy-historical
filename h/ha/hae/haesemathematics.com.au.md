We are also compliant with the requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**What data do we collect?**

In order to operate, we need to obtain and retain names, postal and billing addresses, and email addresses of our customers. This is considered basic personal data and we are obliged to handle it appropriately.

We do not now, or intend to keep in the future, any customer data that is considered to be sensitive personal information.
