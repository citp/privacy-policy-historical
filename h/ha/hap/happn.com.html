    <h3>1.8 Storage of Personal Data</h3>

    <p>HAPPN will store the Member's personal data for as long as required in order for the Member to use his/her Account. The Member is however informed that all of his/her personal data shall be stored for one year after his/her account is deleted so that it can be reallocated if the Member signs up again.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, please note that in accordance with its status as a hosting provider, happn has a legal obligation to retain some of Members' personal data for a period of one year based on Article 6, II of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act (Loi pour la Confiance dans l’Economie Numérique) of 21 June 2004.</p>

    <p>Pursuant to the Decree of 25 February 2011 pertaining to the retention and communication of data, the retention period applied to happn is calculated from the moment the content is created for data referred to by 1° and 2° of Article 6, II of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act, i.e.:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The username used to log in which is at the source of the communication;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The username assigned to the content by the information system;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The protocol types used;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The operation type;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The operation dates and times;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The username used by the originator of the operation if provided by the latter.</p>

    <p>The retention period applied to happn is calculated from the moment the agreement is cancelled or the profile is deleted for the data referred to by 3° of the same Article, i.e.:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• First names and surnames</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Any aliases used</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Linked e-mail addresses or Accounts</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Phone numbers</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The password and data used to verify or amend the profile (most recent version).</p>

    <p>HAPPN undertakes to make every effort and to invest all means at its disposal in order to guarantee that the stored data is as secure as possible. It is however the Member's responsibility to take appropriate action in order to protect his/her data.</p>

    <p>HAPPN shall not collect data from minors. Should a Member lie about his/her date of birth, and particularly if he/she fraudulently claims to be over 18 years of age, the parents of the minor in question may inform happn of this by sending a letter to the address shown in Article 17 in order to request that the data be deleted. HAPPN undertakes to delete all data on the minor in question as soon as possible.</p>

    <h3>1.9 Transfer of Personal Data outside the EU</h3>

    <p>When registering, the Member expressly consents to his/her data being transmitted to subcontractors and hosted on servers by our service providers outside the European Union, for proper provision of the service, to the end of elaborating statistical studies and for the purpose of providing customer care support to Members.</p>

    <p>Happn guaranties that the transfers are made in conditions ensuring the confidentiality and security of the data and providing for an adequate level of protection with respect to the article 68 and 69 of the French “Loi informatique et Liberté” of 1978.</p>
