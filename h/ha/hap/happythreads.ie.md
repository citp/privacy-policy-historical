### Secure Shopping

All payment processing is handled securely by Realex Payments.

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Security Standards (PCI DSS) is a mandatory compliance standard for all payment service providers. Realex Payments was an early adopter of this standard in 2003, making it one of the first companies in the Europe to become fully compliant. The standard enforces high levels of security in all areas where cardholder data is transmitted or stored. Strong protections such as encryption, intrusion detection and response, formalised policies and standards and security aware development methodologies all contribute to making Realex Payments the secure choice for payment processing needs.

Never send your bank or credit card details by email  
Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers. We will never, ever ask for sensitive information via email.

When ordering products or services on the site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
