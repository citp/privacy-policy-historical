<b>How does Mondo Media protect Children's Privacy?</b><br>
The safety of children is very important to us. <u>No information should be submitted to or posted at Mondo Media by children under the age of 13 ("Children") without the prior consent of their parent or guardian.</u>
<br><br>
<b>Verifiable Parental Consent</b><br>
We are required by law to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from Children. Before we collect any information on a Child, we require the parent or guardian (each a "Parent") to verify his or her consent by completing a consent form (which may be obtained by sending an e-mail request to us at <a href="mailto:safetyforlittleurchins@mondomedia.com">safetyforlittleurchins@mondomedia.com</a>).  By agreeing to the registration of his or her Child, a Parent: (i) agrees that the Child's online activities are subject to a number of rules and policies, including without limitation this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service; and (ii) consents to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information about the Child solely as described in this Privacy Policy. We make special provisions to allow parents to control the personal information we collect from Children, as described below. 
<br><br>
<b>Collector of Personal Information</b><br>
Mondo Media owns and operates this web site and this policy addresses only the activities of Mondo Media. Other sites (including those to which we may link) may have their own policies, which we do not control and which are not addressed by this policy. 
<br><br>
<b>What and How Personal Information is Collected. </b>
<br><br>
<b>Collection by Mondo Media</b><br>
We may directly collect the following types of personal information about Children: name, address, email address, parent's registration information, birth dates, gender, or other similar data that may help us to better tailor our services for each visitor. In addition, our servers may collect personal information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of "cookies," as described above) about Children's activities while using our services, including Internet sites and web pages visited. 
<br><br>
<b>Public Areas </b><br>
"Public Areas" are those other areas, such as chat rooms, guest books and other means of online communication, in which a visitor or a third party may send a communication that is publicly available to other members. Public Areas provide special circumstances relating to the collection and disclosure of personal information. Visitors voluntarily may disclose any personal information whatsoever when they participate in Public Areas, but should exercise caution when doing so. In these instances, Mondo Media does not control that disclosure, and the personal information may be available to anyone who is also participating in that Public Area. 
<br><br>
<b>Prohibited Collection</b><br>
We are prohibited by law from conditioning Children's participation in a game, eligibility for a prize, or another similar activity, on the Child's disclosure of more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 
<br><br>
<b>Our Use of Personal Information </b><br>
Mondo Media may use Children's personal information collected by it as described above: to operate its site, to fulfill a requested transaction, for record keeping, for technical support or maintenance, to obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection of personal information, or for marketing directly to the Child. 
<br><br>
<b>Disclosure of Personal Information. </b>
<br><br>
<b>Disclosure by Mondo Media</b><br>
We may disclose aggregated information about our visitors but that information contains no personally identifiable information. 
Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. 
<br><br>
<b>Public Disclosure by Visitors </b><br>
Any time any member, including Children, voluntarily discloses personal information in a Public Area, that personal information may be used by third parties. In these cases, the member must choose whether or not to disclose personal information. 
<br><br>
<b>Deletion of Personal Information  </b><br>
At the request of a parent or guardian, we will delete the personal information we have gathered about their Child and will ensure that we do not collect any additional personal information from their Child.  Such requests may be sent to us via email at <a href="mailto:safetyforlittleurchins@mondomedia.com">safetyforlittleurchins@mondomedia.com</a>.
 <br><br>
The Internet is huge and can be great fun to explore, but parents and children need to educate themselves if they want to have a safe and enjoyable online experience.
<br><br>
<hr><br>
<b>Your Consent </b><br>
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice.  If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.  If you are concerned about how your information may be used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
<br><br>
