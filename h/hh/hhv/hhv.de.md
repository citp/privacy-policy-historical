## 2\. Security of data transmission

To ensure the security of your personal data during transmission, we use state of the art SSL encryption procedures. You can recognise encrypted data transmission by the “https://www.hhv.de” at the beginning of the browser line. Personal data includes, for instance, your name, your address or email address as well as other data you communicate to us when registering or creating a customer account. Only submit your confidential information if SSL encryption is activated.

## 3\. This is how we use your data

### 3.1 Cookies

Cookies are text files, which are stored on your computer and which enable analysing your use of the website. For example, information regarding the operating system, the browser, your IP address, the website you previously accessed (referrer URL) as well as the date and time of your visit to hhv.de. Cookies enable determining which websites are preferably accessed. Consequently, we can better adjust the content of our pages to the visitors of our website and optimise our offers. Furthermore, this information serves automatically recognising you during your next visit to hhv.de and making navigation easier for you. For example, cookies allow the user to remain logged in permanently, so the repeated entry of the login data is not necessary.

Cookies cannot be used to start programs or transmit viruses to a computer.

You can also use our website without cookies. If you do not want your computer to be recognised, you can prevent cookies from being stored on your hard drive by choosing “do not accept any cookies” in your browser settings. Please refer to the instructions from your browser manufacturer, to see how this is exactly done. If you do not accept any cookies, this can lead to functional restrictions in our offers. You can delete cookies, which were already placed on your computer, at any time. Alternatively, you can set your browser to block cookies from our domain. However, we would like to point out that you may then not be able to use the full range of the functions on hhv.de.

### 3.2 Server data / server log files

Inter alia, the following data transmitted by your web browser to us or our web space provider is collected for technical reasons. This data includes:

  * browser type and version
  * operating system used
  * web page from which you are visiting us (referrer URL)
  * web page you are visiting
  * date and time of your access
  * your Internet Protocol (IP) address.



This anonymous data is stored separately from your possibly indicated personal data and is not attributable to specific individuals. It is analysed for statistical purposes, to be able to optimise our website and our offers. We reserve the right to subsequently review this data if we become aware of concrete indications of illegal use.

### 3.3 Newsletter

With the newsletter, we periodically inform you about us and our offers. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure for subscribing to our newsletter; that means we will not send you a newsletter via email until you click on a link in our notification email confirming that you would like to receive our newsletter. No other data is collected. Your data is not forwarded to third parties. Excluded from this are solely partner companies, which are responsible for the technical procedure involved in sending the newsletter.

With the subscription to the HHV newsletter, we store your IP address and the subscription date. This storage solely serves as proof in the event that a third party misuses an email address and subscribes to the newsletter, without the authorised individual being aware of this.

Our newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels, which enable us to detect whether and when an email was opened. Furthermore, link clicks are analysed within the newsletter. We store this data, to allow us to ideally adjust our newsletters to the wishes and interests of our subscribers. Therefore, the data collected in this manner is used, to send personalised newsletters to the respective recipients.

You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the email addresses as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time. By revoking your consent to receive the newsletter, the consent for the aforementioned tracking is also revoked. Revocation can be conducted via a notification to the contact options listed in Section 1 of this privacy policy. Users, who would no longer like to receive our newsletter or our advertising emails, can of course unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the end of every newsletter.

### 3.4 Product recommendations via email

As a customer of HHV, you will receive product recommendations via email at random intervals. You will receive these irrespective of whether or not you subscribed to a newsletter. By sending you these emails, we would like to provide you with information on our products, which you may be interested in based on your last purchases and your wish list in our shop. In the process, we strictly observe the legal provisions.

Insofar as you no longer want to receive any product recommendations or any kind of promotional content, you can object to this at any time without any costs arising for this other than the transmission costs in accordance with the basic rates. A written notification addressed to the contact details stated in Chapter 1 (via letter or email) suffices for this purpose. Of course you can also find an unsubscribe link in every email.

### 3.5 Contact form

Our website provides you with the option of contacting us via email and/or using a contact form. We only use your email address to process your enquiry as well as for possible follow-up questions.

### 3.6 Google services

We use the following services of the Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA on our website:

#### Web analysis with Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of the Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA on our website. We entered into an agreement with Google for order processing and fully implement the legal provisions for the use of Google Analytics.

We use the “Activation of the IP anonymisation” feature on this website. In this case, your IP address is already truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and therefore, anonymised. The full IP address is only transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there in exceptional cases.

Using cookies, information such as the operating system, the browser, your IP address, the website you previously accessed (referrer URL) and the date and time of your visit to our website is collected. The information on the use of our website, which is created in this manner, is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google uses this information to analyse your use of our website, to compile reports on the website activity for the website operator and to provide other services associated with the use of the website and Internet. Insofar as required by law or insofar as third parties process this data on behalf of Google, Google will also transfer this information to these third parties. This use is anonymised or pseudonymised. You can find more detailed information on this directly at Google.

More information on how user data is handled at Google Analytics can be found in the Google privacy policy: [support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en)

You can prevent the collection of the data created by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of this data by Google. However, we would like to point out that you may then not be able to use the full range of the functions on this website.

  * Select the respective setting in your browser software
  * Click on this link: Disable Google Analytics
  * An opt-out cookie is placed, which prevents the future collection of your data when visiting this website: At the same time, a collection on this website by Google Analytics and for this browser is prevented in the future, as long as the cookie remains installed in your browser.



#### Google Conversion Tracking

If you accessed our website from a Google ad, Google AdWords places a cookie on your computer. This cookie is no longer valid after 30 days and does not enable identifying you personally. If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can detect that you, as a user, clicked on one of our ads placed at Google and were connected to our site. The information collected with the help of Google serves compiling statistics on visitors for our website. These statistics show us the total number of users, who clicked on our ad and furthermore, which pages the respective users then accessed. However, we as well as other advertisers do not receive any information via “Google AdWords”, which allow identifying users personally.   
You can access the Google privacy policy in this regard [here](https://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html).

You can prevent the installation of the cookies by means of the respective setting in your browser, for instance using the browser setting, which disables the automatic placement of cookies in general or specifically only disables the cookies from the “googleadservices.com” domain.

#### Google Remarketing

Using this service, ads can be placed for users, who already visited our website in the past.

Within the Google advertising network, this enables showing advertisements on our website, which are adapted to your interests. Google remarketing uses cookies for this analysis. This enables recognising our visitors as soon as they access websites within the Google advertising network. This way, advertisements can be placed within the Google advertising network, which relate to content, which the visitor previously accessed on websites of the Google advertising network, which also use the Google remarketing feature. According to Google, no personal data is collected in the process. You can disable this feature if you make the corresponding settings at [google.com/settings/ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies for interest-related advertisements via the advertising network initiative by following the instructions at [networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

#### Google Maps

Every time the “Google Maps” component is accessed, a cookie is placed by Google, to process user settings and data for the display of the page on which the “Google Maps” component is integrated. This cookie is normally not deleted by closing the browser but rather expires after a specific time, unless you already deleted it manually.  
If you disagree with this processing of your data, you have the option of disabling the “Google Maps” service and in doing so, preventing the transmission of data to Google. In order to do this, you must disable the JavaScript function in your browser. However, we would like to point out that in this case, you will not be able to use “Google Maps” or will only be able to use it to a limited extent.

The use of “Google Maps” and the information obtained via “Google Maps” takes place according to the Google terms of use [google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html) as well as the additional business conditions for “Google Maps” [google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html](https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html).

### 3.7 Facebook services

On some of our pages, we use the following communication tools of the Facebook Ireland Limited Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2 Ireland (hereinafter “Facebook”).

#### Facebook Pixel Website Custom Audiences

This tool enables us to supply ads on Facebook, which are tailored to your interests. In the process, an irreversible and non-personal checksum (hash value) is basically generated from your user data, which can be transmitted to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. Therefore, the content is controlled anonymously solely based on encrypted values, for which one specific value is also always created for a specific identification value, without sending the plain data to us or Facebook. Data transmission takes place using TLS (Transport Layer Security). The Facebook cookie is activated for the Website Custom Audiences product.

Additional information regarding the purpose and scope of data processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as your setting options to protect your privacy can be found in the Facebook privacy policies, which, inter alia, can be found at [facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences](https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences) and [facebook.com/privacy/explanation](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation). If you would like to object to the use of Facebook Website Custom Audiences, you can do this in your Facebook account settings [here](https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences/).

#### Facebook like button

hhv.de integrate the Facebook „like button”. You can find an overview of the Facebook plugins [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/). Every time access is made to our website, which is equipped with such a component, this component initiates that the browser you are using downloads a corresponding display of the Facebook component. This process informs Facebook of the precise page within hhv.de you are currently accessing. When you access our page while you are logged in to Facebook, the information collected by the component shows Facebook the precise page you are accessing and allocates this information to your personal account on Facebook. If you click the “like” button for instance or if you make respective comments, this information is transmitted to your personal user account on Facebook and stored there. Furthermore, the information that you visited our site is transmitted to Facebook. This takes place irrespective of whether or not you clicked the component.

We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the website, do not receive any information regarding the content of the transmitted data or its use by Facebook. Additional information on this matter can be found in the [Facebook privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update). If you do not want Facebook to be able to allocate your visit to our site to your Facebook user account, please log out of your Facebook user account first.

### 3.8 Share function via AddToAny

Through a double-click procedure, our website offers the option of sharing content in social networks via the AddToAny service. While using this service, cookies are being employed. The so collected data (for example access time or browser language) will be sent to AddToAny to the USA.

Further information on data processing and privacy by AddToAny can be found under [addtoany.com/privacy](https://www.addtoany.com/privacy). Here you will find the type of data being processed as well as the purpose. HHV is not involved in the processing of the enlisted data.

According to YouTube, data is only transmitted to the YouTube server in the “extended data protection mode”, in particular which of our web pages you visited, if you watch the video. If you are simultaneously logged in to YouTube, this information is allocated to your member account at YouTube. You can prevent this by logging out of your member account prior to visiting our website. Additional information on YouTube’s data privacy was made available by Google [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy/update?hl=en&gl=de).

### 3.10 Affiliate marketing

These affiliate tracking cookies do not store any personal data. Only the identification number of the intermediary partner as well the reference number of the advertising media you clicked on is collected. This information is required to handle payments between the website operator and the HHV.
