**Our Privileges List**

Registered Members who join the Privileges email list will receive announcements, promotions, deals and offers from selected advertisers.

Privilege List members who also provide mobile phone information may receive SMS messages from Privileges advertisers.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

**Business Transfers**  
We are always seeking to improve our network of Web sites and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.
