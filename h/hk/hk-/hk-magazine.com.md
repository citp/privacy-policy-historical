Asia City Online collects user-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify users and send notifications related to the use of the service. Asia City Online also collects user-submitted profile information such as gender, age, etc.  
Please note that:

  * You may never use another's account without permission.

  * Asia City Online may also share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties in order to present to members more targeted advertising, products and services.
  * As a matter of policy, except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away personal information of our Registered Members.

Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can still view much of the content and use many of the services offered by Asia City Online on the Website without registering.  
Changes in Our Privacy Policy

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email or by placing a prominent notice on the Website.

**Public Forums**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.  
Email/SMS Lists/Opt-out

Users of the site may request to receive our electronic newsletters and SMS notifications and be added to our Email/SMS Lists.  From time to time, Asia City Online may allow qualified and carefully selected third parties to rent all or part of our Email and/or SMS Lists for the purposes of sending advertising, marketing or promotional messages to Asia City Online users.  By requesting to receive electronic newsletters or SMS notifications, users are expressly agreeing to receive such advertising, marketing or promotional messages.  In such cases, the Email/SMS List remains the property of Asia City Online and will not be released to the third party.  Users may choose to opt out from the Email and/or SMS Lists at any time.  
Business transfers

We are always seeking to improve our network of Web sites and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.
