For example, we have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that is tailored to your interests. It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well. For example, we may process your information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our website, and to ensure our websites and systems are secure. When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

We process personal information for certain legitimate business purposes, which include some or all of the following:

  * where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalise or otherwise improve our services / communications for the benefit of our customers
  * to identify and prevent fraud • to enhance the security of our network and information systems
  * to better understand how people interact with our websites
  * to provide postal communications which we think will be of interest to you
  * to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising



Whenever we process data for these purposes we will ensure that we always keep your Personal Data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing if you wish, and if you wish to do so please get in touch with us (See contact details below). Please bear in mind that if you object this may affect our ability to carry out tasks above for your benefit.
