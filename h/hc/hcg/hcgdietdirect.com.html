                            	<p align="left"><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
                            	<p>Lipoderm believes it is important for you to know what types of information we collect when you use our site.&nbsp; We employ various methods for collecting information.&nbsp;</p>
                            	<p> To begin with, we use “cookies” that are needed to compile aggregate non-personally identifiable information about the visitors to our web site. Personally identifiable information consists of information that is unique to you, such as credit card numbers, bank accounts, social security numbers, home address, email address and the like.&nbsp; This is the type of information that most people consider private and deem the most important to protect from unauthorized access.&nbsp; </p>
                            	<p>Non-personally identifiable information most often consists of things such as your search preferences, the types of products you have bought, how many times you have visited a particular web site, etc.&nbsp; This type of information is usually associated with a particular computer or IP address but not with a particular person.&nbsp;</p>
                            	<p> “Cookies” are pieces of information generated by a Web server and stored in the user's computer, ready for future access.&nbsp; Each time you access our web site; our server finds the relevant cookie on your computer.&nbsp; The information contained within that cookie is then used to customize your experience with our site.&nbsp; The following is a list of the information we collect: <em>(insert all information you collect, names, numbers, social security, email, etc.) </em></p>
                            	<p>&nbsp;</p>
                           	  <p align="left"><strong>WHY DO WE COLLECT THIS INFORMATION?</strong></p>
                            	<p>We use this information in order to serve the needs of our customers.&nbsp; We need to know who you are in order to verify the credit card information you have sent us.&nbsp; We collect several pieces of personal information from you in order to complete this verification process.&nbsp; </p>
                            	<p>The non-personal information that we collect from you is used in order to offer you better service and to make your experience with our site more enjoyable.&nbsp; Any information that we may inadvertently collect from you, that does not serve one of these reasons stated above, is immediately purged from our system.&nbsp; </p>

                            	<p align="left"><strong>HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION PROTECTED?</strong></p>
                            	<p>We use the latest in encryption technology, including 128 bit SSL encryption in the cart section of our shopping cart to ensure that any sensitive information that is sent by you to us via the Internet is protected from unauthorized interception.&nbsp; </p>
                            	<p>We employ the latest in firewall protection to prevent unauthorized access into our information storage areas.&nbsp; </p>
                            	<p>We maintain a rigorous hiring process to screen out potential employees with criminal backgrounds.&nbsp; </p>
                            	<p>All employees that we do hire have to sign a confidentiality agreement that forbids them from disclosing any information to which the employee has access, to other individuals or entities.&nbsp; </p>
                            	<p>We also have back up servers and power supplies to guard against power outages and other natural occurrences that could pose a threat to the integrity of your personal information.&nbsp; </p>
                            	<p>Passwords are required in order for you to gain access to your account.&nbsp; Once an account has been terminated, measures are taken to remove those users from the system who no longer need access to our system. </p>
                            	<p>When an employee is terminated or is no longer with the company, we change the access codes that the employee used to access any customer accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
