This information typically includes your name, professional credentials, email address and other contact data. We may append information from other sources, such as Google Analytics, to supplement what you give us. We do, on occasion, obtain or license contact information from third parties for limited marketing purposes, such as maintaining an accurate marketing database.

We gather date, time and certain additional information about a user's browser and system or device configuration and capabilities, navigation history and IP address for all visitors to our web sites. We may use this information for our internal security audit log, for trend analysis and system administration and to gather broad information about our audiences. When you submit information through a form on one of our websites, we capture and store your IP address and email address. We use this information for website personalization purposes.

#### **Do we use cookies?**

We use cookies and other commonly used data collection technologies on our websites and in our newsletters and emails to collect information on both an aggregate and individual basis. Please see our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy) for more details on how we use cookies and how to control cookies or their use for targeted advertising or marketing.

  * keep our systems, users, employees and services safe; and
  * provide you with the information or support you requested.



#### **How long do we keep your personal information?**

We keep your personal information for so long as is necessary in light of the purpose for which it was originally collected or lawfully further processed. The criteria we use to determine the period of time for which your personal information may be kept include:

  * the nature and type of personal information that you provide to us;
  * the purpose for which you provide your personal information to us; and necessary business and operational requirements to continue to supply you with the services or functionality you have requested.



We may retain your information for a longer time period if we are required to do so by law.

#### **How do we share your personal information?**

We may disclose personal information about you to third parties, including:

  * to vendors that work on our behalf;
  * to law enforcement when we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us;
  * to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; and
  * to protect human safety or our networks or property, or as part of a sale or merger of our company or business assets.



#### **Where do we keep your personal information?**

We collect, store, and process information on servers around the world and may access that information globally. If you are located in the European Union, please note that your personal information may be transferred out of, or stored outside, the European Economic Area. The privacy protections in these jurisdictions may not be equivalent to those in Europe. We will take steps to ensure that your personal information continues to be protected through adequate safeguards, copies of which are available from us on request at the email address below.

#### **What rights do you have in relation to your personal information?**

European law gives individuals a number of rights in relation to their personal information. These include the right to access, and in some circumstances to amend, delete, or restrict the continued processing of, personal information. Please note that deleting your information or restricting the continued processing of your information may limit our ability to continue to provide our websites, applications, and online services to you.

You also have a choice about:

  * **Whether to receive email marketing messages from us.** You may opt out of our email marketing lists by following the opt-out directions at the bottom of our promotional emails. Please note that we have a number of brands and products and allow you to opt out selectively. To remove a specific email address from all HCL email marketing, send a request to [unsubcribe@hcl.com](mailto:unsubcribe@hcl.com).
  * **Whether to share information about yourself and your use of our sites with third parties including social media sites.**
    * If you join one of our online communities, such as [www.straighttalk.hcl.com](http://www.straighttalk.hcl.com/), your comments as well as certain information about you may be visible to other members of the community. Please take a moment to understand how each forum works and what choices you have.
  * If you use credentials from a third party, like Facebook, to register, then that third party will also record the fact that you have registered for our sites and may use that information consistent with its own privacy statements and practices. If you use Share, Like or similar social media buttons, those actions may be posted elsewhere (such as on the relevant social media sites).
  * **Whether to allow certain uses of cookies and other data collection technologies.** Please see our [**Cookies Policy**](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy).



If you have any questions about your rights, please email us at [privacy@hcl.com](mailto:privacy@hcl.com).  
You can also contact your local Data Protection Authority.

#### **How do we safeguard your personal information?**

We use a range of security measures to protect your personal information. Please be aware, however, that HCL cannot guarantee that third parties will safeguard your personal information in a similar manner. Unencrypted information - including information sent via E-mail - may also be able to be read by third parties. As a user of our services, you are responsible for protecting the information you provide, including user name and passwords, from misuse, by encryption or other means.

#### **How will we update this Policy?**

We are constantly working to develop new services. We may also change our practices over time as our business and technology evolve, and this may involve changes to the ways in which we collect, process and use your information. As a result, we may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.

If we materially change our Privacy Policy, we will take steps to inform you of the change. We may do this through email, SMS, notices on our websites or other means (or a combination of these means). If you continue to use our websites, applications, and online services after the date any revised Privacy Policy comes into effect, you will be deemed to have read and agreed to the revised Privacy Policy.

The “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy shows when it was last updated.
