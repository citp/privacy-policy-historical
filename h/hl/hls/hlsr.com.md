# Privacy Policy

If you are located in the European Union, beginning May 25, 2018, your personal data is protected by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in your relationship with all data controllers, both within and outside the EU. 

The information presented in this section of the Privacy Policy apply only to EU residents. 

If you are a EU resident, you need to be aware that the personal data that we collect about you may be transferred to and processed by recipients that are located outside the European Economic Area, some of which are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, and some not. We will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law. 

We will retain your personal data that we collect as described in the previous sections of this Privacy Policy as long as necessary to provide you with the requested services and notifications. Once you unsubscribe, we will take steps to remove your personal data from our systems within 30 days from the date of the account deletion. This does not apply to the extent needed to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is subject (e.g. taxation purposes). 

We may also retain your personal data after the termination of your account to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or if we need your personal data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. To the extent possible, we will restrict the processing of your personal data for such limited purposes after the termination of your account.
