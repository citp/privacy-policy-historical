# Privacy Policy – HobbyLink Japan

Your privacy is very important to us. Except for cases where we comply with a lawful demand for information by law enforcement authorities, or we attempt to secure relief in cases of customer fraud, HobbyLink Japan will never disclose any personal information you provide us (such as your name, shipping address, email address or telephone number), or any information related to your purchase history with us, to any third parties. Also, HLJ does not handle or keep your credit card information; all that is handled by PayPal.

Your browser is not required to accept cookies, although some functionality on our website may be disabled if you decline them (a choice you can make in your browser's settings).

As you browse HLJ.com, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partner, [AdRoll](https://www.adroll.com/), then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with HLJ.com. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address, or telephone number.  You can visit [this page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) to opt out of AdRoll’s and their partners’ targeted advertising. 

We use MailChimp to manage our newsletter and other email lists. There’s no third-party tracking in messages we send through MailChimp besides MailChimp’s own analytics, which may aggregate how many subscribers open a message or click the links inside. MailChimp’s privacy policy is available at <http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy>. 

You can unsubscribe from our newsletter by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided at the end of the newsletter. You can also email [support@disconnect.me](mailto:support@disconnect.me) to update your email address, or to request that we delete your email.
