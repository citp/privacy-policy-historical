      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" --> 
      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) Privacy Policy is designed 
        to tell you about practices regarding the collection, use and 
        disclosure of information that you may provide via the (HMRC) 
        website. Whenever you use this site, you consent to the collection, 
        use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this 
        Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h2>Ways that HMRC collect information</h2>
      <p>Some areas of the site require you to actively submit information 
        in order for you to benefit from specific features (such as 
        the range of online services). You will be informed at each 
        information collection point what information is required and 
        what information is optional.</p>
      <p>Some of this information may be personal (information that 
        can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, 
        address, email address, phone number etc).</p>
      <p>HMRC only collect such information when you choose to supply 
        it to them.</p>
      <p>Information is also gathered without you actively providing 
        it, through the use of various technologies and methods such 
        as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and cookies. These methods 
        do not collect or store personal information.</p>
      <p>An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your 
        Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the internet. 
        It is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable 
        information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic 
        (changing each time you connect to the internet), rather than 
        static (unique to a particular user's computer).</p>
      <p>HMRC use your IP address to diagnose problems with their server, 
        report aggregate information, and determine the fastest route 
        for your computer to use in connecting to the site, and to administer 
        and improve the site.</p>
      <div class="totop"><b><a href="#top">Top</a>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>HMRC uses small bits of data stored on your computer called 
        'cookies'. Find out what HMRC uses them for, and how to control 
        their use.</p>
      <p><a href="cookies.htm">Your privacy - how cookies are used by 
        HMRC</a></p>
      <h2>Page tagging</h2>
      <p>HMRC use JavaScript page tags to aggregate and analyse customer 
        usage patterns on the website. This provides HMRC with data 
        on your site usage and behaviour. HMRC use this information 
        to make changes to the layout of the website and to the information 
        in it. This process does not collect any personal or identifiable 
        information about users. You can disable JavaScript on your 
        computer, however disabling JavaScript may affect your ability 
        to access some HMRC online tools and services.</p>
      <p>Sometimes HMRC tag pages on sites used to promote various campaigns. 
        These tags are provided by the advertising management partner, 
        DoubleClick. These tags enable DoubleClick to recognise a unique 
        cookie on your browser, which in turn enables HMRC to learn 
        which advertisements bring users to the website. The cookie 
        was placed by HMRC, or by another advertiser who works with 
        DoubleClick. With this technology, the information that HMRC 
        collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. 
        It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or 
        email address. There is more information about DoubleClick - 
        including information about how to opt out of these technologies 
        - on their website.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" title="This link will open a page in a new browser window">Privacy 
          information about DoubleClick (Opens new window)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="totop"><b><a href="#top">Top</a>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <h2>Monitoring of email</h2>
      <p>HMRC may monitor email communications with HMRC (this includes 
        any HMRC member of staff). Any such monitoring will take place 
        in accordance with the law.</p>
      <h2>Web statistics</h2>
      <p>HMRC use log files generated by the web servers to analyse 
        site usage and statistics but the files do not identify any 
        personal information. Log file analysis helps HMRC to understand 
        usage patterns on the website and to make improvements to the 
        service.</p>
      <h2>Disclosure</h2>
      <p>Except as otherwise stated, HMRC may use information you provide 
        via this site to improve the content, to customise the site 
        to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you 
        have requested it), for internal marketing and research purposes, 
        and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>HMRC do not disclose any information you provide via the site 
        to any third parties or other Government departments except 
        where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>such disclosures are necessary to fulfil HMRC service obligations 
          to you, in which case HMRC will require such third parties 
          to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy 
        </li>
        <li> required by applicable laws, courts orders, or Government 
          regulations (for example, to prevent or detect crime) </li>
        <li>you give HMRC permission to do so </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="totop"><b><a href="#top">Top</a>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <h2>Access to and correction of personal information</h2>
      <p>HMRC will take all reasonable steps in accordance with legal 
        obligations to update or correct, personally identifiable information 
        that you submit via this site.</p>
      <p>You have a right to ask to see details of any personal information 
        that HMRC hold about you. If you wish to do so please contact 
        the HMRC office that you have been dealing with.</p>
      <div class="totop"><b><a href="#top">Top</a>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>HMRC has a legal duty to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer 
        information. HMRC take all reasonable steps to protect any information 
        you submit via the website, both online and offline, in accordance 
        with legislation such as the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
      <p>HMRC take all appropriate steps to protect your personally 
        identifiable information as you transmit your information from 
        your computer to the HMRC site and to protect such information 
        for loss, misuse, and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, 
        or destruction. HMRC use leading technologies and encryption 
        software to safeguard your data, and operate strict security 
        standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.</p>
      <p>Where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access 
        features on this site, you also have a responsibility to take 
        reasonable steps to safeguard them.</p>
      <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
      <p>This site contains links and references to other websites. 
        Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those 
        websites and HMRC encourages you to read the Privacy Policy 
        of every website you visit.</p>
      <h2>Notification of changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>HMRC will post details of any changes to the Privacy Policy 
        on the website to help ensure you are always aware of the information 
        HMRC collect, how HMRC use it, and in what circumstances, if 
        any, HMRC share it with other parties.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated July 2008.</p>
