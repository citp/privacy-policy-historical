# Privacy statement and Cookies - HM Treasury

##  What is a Cookie? 

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These pieces of information are used to make the website work or improve services for you through, for example: 

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task; 
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested; 
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast. 



We sometimes embed photo and video content from websites such as YouTube and Flickr. As a result, when you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites.  We do not control the dissemination of these cookies.  You should check the relevant third party website for more information about these.
