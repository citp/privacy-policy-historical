This policy describes how Hungry Howie's Pizza ("Hungry Howie’s" or “our”) may use information collected from users of Hungry Howie’s website and the Hungry Howie’s mobile app (each a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”).  Hungry Howie’s reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and without sending notice to you, so you should review this Privacy Policy periodically.  The effective date of this notice and any revised or changed notice may be found on this page, on the upper left corner of the notice.  Any changes will be effective after the effective date of the change and will not affect any dispute arising prior to the effective date of the change.

**Collection of Personal Information**

We may collect the following information from users who provide us this information in order to create an account and/or order from Hungry Howie’s or any of its independently owned and operated franchised restaurants or food service providers:  your name, your e-mail address, your phone number, your address, your credit card numbers, and your order history.  **If you elect to establish an online account, we have contracted with a third party to perform these functions for us, so that third party’s privacy policy**[ http://revention.com/hungerrush/privacy-policy](http://revention.com/hungerrush/privacy-policy) **and terms of use**[ http://revention.com/hungerrush/terms-of-use](http://revention.com/hungerrush/terms-of-use) **also apply.**

Hungry Howie’s policy is to prohibit the unlawful disclosure of your personal information, but **HUNGRY HOWIE’S MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SECURITY OR PRIVACY OF INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY PROVIDE THROUGH THE SITES.**

Hungry Howie’s has entered into a joint marketing arrangement with our independently owned and operated franchised restaurants and/or food service providers and any information provided by you may be shared with our independently owned franchised restaurants and/or food service providers.  Hungry Howie’s may contact any individual who has shared personally identifiable information with Hungry Howie’s for sales and marketing purposes, for feedback about Hungry Howie’s and its services, or for any other reason logically related to the operation of Hungry Howie's business and agency. 

We may supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services, or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information. 

**Online Technology**

The Sites’ technology has the ability to collect data other than personally identifiable information. Hungry Howie’s may collect information about your computer configuration, such as your browser type, operating system, or ISP domain name. Hungry Howie’s may collect information about the site you last visited prior to visiting a Site or about your activity during your visit to a Site. This information may be used by Hungry Howie’s to administer the technical and operational aspects of a Site, and may include using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Hungry Howie’s may use cookies (a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user) to assist in performing some or all of these activities. You can set your browser to accept all, some or no cookies. If you set your browser to reject all cookies, you may be limited in your ability to access some or all aspects of a Site or be required to re-enter information. 

**Mobile Devices**

Hungry Howie’s technology may also collect the unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device (any of which are referred to herein as a “Device”) used to access a Site or through use of the Hungry Howie’s mobile app. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Site or through use of the Hungry Howie’s mobile app.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

The preceding paragraphs describe the categories of personally identifiable information that Hungry Howie’s collects in the Sites.  Hungry Howie’s may disclose personally identifiable information you provide to third parties if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:  (a) complete the sales transaction, such as providing your payment or delivery information; (b) comply with legal process; (c) enforce the Terms of Use; (d) respond to claims that any information you provide violates the rights of third parties; (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Hungry Howie’s, its users and/or the public; or (f) in relation to the sale, assignment, transfer or acquisition of all or substantially all of Hungry Howie’s assets or shares by a third party.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, Hungry Howie’s will NOT sell or trade your personally identifiable information with third parties, such as sellers of goods or services. 

If you wish to change personally identifiable information that you have provided Hungry Howie’s, please see the “Contact Hungry Howie’s” section below. 

**Tracking**

Hungry Howie’s will not recognize Web browser “do not track” signals.  If you would like additional information about online tracking and various opt-out mechanisms, please see [http://donottrack.us/](http://donottrack.us/)

Because Hungry Howie’s links to social media sites, and from time to time may include third-party advertisements, other parties may collect your personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different web sites when you visit a Site. 

Please note that not all tracking will stop even if you delete cookies. 

**Analytics and Advertisements**

For the purpose of enabling better website design and a better user experience, we employ Google Analytics (a web service by Google, Inc.) to track site traffic and provide aggregate reports of how the public interacts with the Sites. Session cookies are employed by Google Analytics in the form of client-side JavaScript code. In utilizing this analytics service, we maintain our existing standards in regards to the sharing and disclosure of information, security and privacy safeguards for the data, and the data retention policy, each described below. Google Analytics analyzes website usage information automatically upon visits to the Sites. Users who do not wish to have their visit information to our website collected by Google Analytics may opt-out by downloading a browser extension or by disabling cookies in their browser settings. Opting-out of web measurements will still permit users to access the full services of the website with most included information and functionality.  However, the preceding two sentences do not apply to services using our mobile app or the mobile apps of third party providers.  Users who do not wish to have their visit information collected by Google Analytics in such cases should not use our mobile app or the mobile apps of third party providers.

In addition, we use Google AdWords, so we are advertising the Site(s) online through a form of tracking called remarketing, Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on various sites across the Internet, and use cookies to serve you ads based on your past visits to the Sites.  You can opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting Google's Ads Settings [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin) . Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

**Encryption**

Hungry Howie’s uses no encryption (data scrambling) on the Sites. When you are on any website that asks you for confidential information, you should check to see if the information being transmitted is encrypted in order to increase the security of your information.  Keep in mind that there is no such thing as perfect security.
