1.     INTRODUCTION
        Hungry Jack’s is a Fast Food Restaurant Chain with its origins in Perth Western Australia; the
        founder of the company in Australia is Mr. Jack Co win. In 1971, Mr Cowin had the foresight to see
        the future market for fast food in Australia. As they say, “the rest is history”. Our first restaurant
        opened in Innaloo, Western Australia, closely followed by restaurants in South Australia,
        Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Thus, we currently have 300+ restaurants in
        Australia. We employ approximately 1000 managers and 17,000 cre wmembers to run the day-to-
        day operations.
        Through these operations, Hungry Jack’s from time to time gathers information from variety of
        individuals, including customers to improve the nature of the services it provides.
        Hungry Jack’s understands individuals’ concerns regarding confidentiality and is totally committed
        to respecting and upholding individuals’ rights to privacy protection under the National Privacy
        Principles (NPPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). While the handling of employee
        records in relation to current and former employment relationships by an employer is exempt under
        the Privacy Act, Hungry Jack’s believes that employee records deserve the same privacy
        protection as the Personal Information covered by the Act. Hungry Jack’s respects the privacy
        rights of all individuals in the workplace, and as such, Hungry Jack’s has chosen to apply the same
        privacy standards in relation to employee records.
        Hungry Jack’s has implemented a program to ensure compliance with the NPPs. This Privacy
        Statement forms part of that compliance program and outlines how Hungry Jack’s deals with
        Personal Information.
2.     APPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT
        This Privacy Statement applies to Personal Information collected by Hungry Jack’s and its

        its possession.
        Hungry Jack’s will only grant access to parties other than Hungry Jack’s officers, employees and

                 pecuniary penalty or for the protection of public revenue
                The third party is an agent or contractor of Hungry Jack’s and it is required by

  4.2 INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
       If personal information is to be transferred overseas, Hungry Jack’s will, wherever practicable,
       obtain the individuals consent prior to the transfer taking place.
       If it is not practical to obtain consent, then the information may still be transferred if, as part of the
       agreement for the transfer of that information, the other organisation agrees to comply with Hungry
       Jack’s privacy obligations to you.
  4.3 IDENTIFICATION
       Hungry Jack’s does not use any prohibited identifiers to identify individuals.
  4.4 STORAGE AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

       Hard copy information is kept under locked security. Personal Information stored on computers is,
       where practical, password protected.
       Hungry Jack’s policy is to dispose of personal records that are no longer in use, unless they are
       required to be stored for accountability, liability or other policy reasons. Where this is the case,
       such records are stored separately from the operational information.
  4.5 UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION
       Hungry Jack’s monitors the quality and accuracy of Personal Information that it maintains and
       where practical, updates that information on a regular basis.
       Individuals can update their Personal Information at any time by contacting any one of our Privacy
       Officers.
5     MINORS
       Hungry Jack’s has adopted the position proposed by the Federal Privacy Commissioner that a
       young person is able to give his or her consent if the minor has a sufficient understanding and
       maturity to understand what is being proposed.
       Where Hungry Jack’s is aware that it is gathering information from a minor, Hungry Jack’s will
       obtain consent from a legal guardian for the collection of the information. Where this is not
       possible, Hungry Jack’s staff will make a determination as to the minor'’ understanding of why the
       Personal Information is being collected, before deciding to collect that information.
6     COMPETITIONS AND CLUBS
       Personal Information gathered during competitions and clubs run by Hungry Jack’s will be
       governed by the principles set out in this Privacy Statement. Further, an express statement in
       relation to privacy is stated on each Hungry Jack’s competition entry form and club membership
       form.

    that communication.
8 DIRECT MARKETING

    disclosed with the consent of the relevant individual as provided for in this Privacy Statement.

                 Providing access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others
                 The information is subject to confidentiality where the individual who provided the

 Hungry Jack’s understands individuals’ concerns regarding confidentiality and is totally committed
 to respecting and upholding individuals’ rights to privacy protection under the National Privacy
 Principles (NPPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). While the handling of employee
 records in relation to current and former employment relationships by an employer is exempt under
 the Privacy Act, Hungry Jack’s believes that employee records deserve the same privacy

            personal information it holds from misuse and loss from unauthorised access, modification or
            disclosure. Hungry Jack’s ® has taken proactive steps to ensure only authorised personnel

            permission from the individuals to whom the information relates prior to access being

            Jack’s, in such instances the request may be denied.
            Examples that may constitute a denial for access are;
               Continual requests for records that HJPL has already established it does not have;

                payment of processing fee);
               Requests that show an intention to harass HJPL and break or overload the system;


                                                42

     group of applicants.
Where an applicant indicates either in writing or by other means an intention not to proceed
with a request, HJPL will declare that the request has been abandoned as of a specific date.
As a matter of good practice Hungry Jack’s will keep the request open for a period not to
exceed 30 days, after which time the request will be made inactive and closed.

associated with a request or denial of a request for personal information.

6.1  If Hungry Jack’s ® holds such personal information about an individual, it will provide the
     individual with access to the information on written request by the individual, except to the extent
     that:
         a) In the case of personal information other than health information, providing access would
            pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health if any individual; or
         b) In the case of health information, providing access would pose a serious threat to the life or
            health of any individual; or
         c) Providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals;
            or
         d) The request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or
         e) The information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between Hungry Jack’s ®
            and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in
            those proceedings; or
         f) Providing access would reveal the intentions of Hungry Jack’s ® in relation to negotiations

         g) Providing access would be unlawful; or
         h) Denying access is required or authorised by or under law; or
         i) Providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity;

                (i)     The prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal
                        offences, breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches

          k) An enforcement body performing a lawful security function asks Hungry Jack’s ® not to
              provide access to the information on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause
              damage to the security of Australia.
6.2  However, where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within Hungry

     may give the individual an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than direct
     access to the information.

     both parties.
