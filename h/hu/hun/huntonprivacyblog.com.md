We may use your name to identify you as a commenter. You also may subscribe to get an RSS feed or email of our blogs by submitting your email address.

  * _Other Uses of Information  
_We may use the personal information you provide on the Sites for our internal purposes. These purposes include administration of the Sites, market research, and data analytics.



We also may use the personal information we collect to protect us against and prevent fraud, claims, and other liabilities and to comply with or enforce applicable legal requirements, and our policies and terms. We use personal information for these purposes when it is necessary to protect, exercise or defend our legal rights, or when we are required to do so by a law that applies to us.

**_Personal Information We Collect by Automated Means  
_**We collect certain information by automated means when you visit our Sites, such as how many users visit our Sites and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor the Sites to our visitors. We collect this information through various means such as “cookies,” “web beacons” and IP addresses. Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.hunton.com/en/cookie-policy.html) for further information.

Our Sites may use analytics to create statistical reports. These reports would tell us, for example, how many users visited our Sites, what pages have been browsed, and from what geographic regions users visited the Sites. The information collected through the use of analytics may include, for example, your IP address, the website from which you visited us, the type of device you used and your search query that led you to the Sites. Your IP address is masked on our systems and will only be used on a need-to-know basis to resolve technical issues, to administer our Sites and to understand visitor preferences. Traffic information on our Sites is accessed only by authorized personnel. We do not use any of this information to directly identify visitors and we do not share it with third parties. We process personal information for these purposes because we have a legitimate interest in understanding how our Sites are used. Our websites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.

**Information We Share  
**We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information visitors submit through our Sites, except as described in this Privacy Notice. We may share your information among Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP-related entities. We also may share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf (for example, to process online registration forms for events or to administer our blogs). These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to legal process, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information you have provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

**Links to Other Sites  
**Occasionally we provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites operate independently from our Sites and are not under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices or terms of use, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any other use of the linked sites.

**How We Protect Personal Information  
**We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards for the Sites designed to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personal information we collect through our Sites.

**Information We Transfer  
**We may transfer the personal information we collect through the Sites to other countries where we do business, which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you originally provided the data.

We will comply with applicable legal requirements by providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to data recipients in countries outside of the European Economic Area. To the extent that these data recipients are in countries that have not been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection, we use appropriate safeguards aimed at ensuring such a level of data protection is in place, including by entering into the European Commission’s EU Standard Contractual Clauses with the data recipients or ensuring that the data recipient has certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, or has implemented Binding Corporate Rules. To obtain a copy of the safeguards, please contact us as indicated below.

**How Long We Keep Information  
**We will keep your personal information for the time period necessary to achieve the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, taking into account applicable statute of limitation periods and records retention requirements under applicable law.

**Your Choices  
**If you would like to update your contact information or preferences, or have your information removed from our mailing lists, please contact us by:
