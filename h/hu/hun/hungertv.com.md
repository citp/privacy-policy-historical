# Privacy Policy | HUNGER TV

This policy explains how hungertv.com uses personal information which we collect from you. It also explains how we use cookies.

When you wish to receive or use services on this website – such as newsletters, prize draws, to upload your work, and as hungertv.com members – you will be asked to submit personal information, such as your name and email address.

## Visitor information

When you visit hungertv.com, the pages you see are downloaded to your computer, along with a text file called a cookie. Each website on the internet can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it but, to protect your privacy, your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

hungertv.com uses cookies for two purposes:

  1. It enables us to personalise parts of the site for your visit. For example, looking at when you are logged in.
  2. We use cookies to analyse where people are going on the site, which, in turn, allows us to provide a better experience for you. This information can not be tied back to an individual user account.



If you have set your computer to reject cookies, you can still browse hungertv.com anonymously. However, you will not be able to register with the site and your interactive experience of may be affected.

## USE AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION

When you supply any personal information to hungertv.com, we have legal obligations towards you regarding the way that we use that data. We must collect the information fairly. That is, we must explain how we will use it (see the notices on particular web pages that let you know why we are requesting the information), and notify you if we want to pass the information on to anyone else.

In general, any information you provide to hungertv.com will only be used within hungertv.com, by its agents and by its service providers. Your information will only be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law. If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to hungertv.com, we can use any information available about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties about the content and your behaviour, such as your employer, school, e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies.

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met, or – in the case of hungertv.com membership – until you no longer wish to continue your registration to hungertv.com. For safety reasons, however, we may store messaging transcript data (including message content, member names, times and dates) arising from the use of hungertv.com. Personal information that is held for people who are not yet registered, but have taken part in other hungertv.com services (for example, email notifications), will be held as long as necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
