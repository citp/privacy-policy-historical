<div class="terms-of-use">
  <p>Dear users,<span class="br-div"></span>
    <span class="br-div"></span>
 Huawei Device Co., Ltd. and its worldwide corporate affiliates  ("Huawei", "we", "our" and "us")  understand how important your privacy is to you and are fully committed to  protecting it. Please do not submit personal or private data to Huawei before  you have read, understood and agreed to this Privacy Policy ("this  Policy").
<span class="br-div"></span><span class="br-div"></span>
 We created this Policy to help you understand:<span class="br-div"></span>
    1. How Huawei uses your personal data<span class="br-div"></span>
    2. How Huawei uses cookies and similar technologies<span class="br-div"></span>
    3. How Huawei discloses your personal data<span class="br-div"></span>
    4. How to access or modify your personal data<span class="br-div"></span>
    5. How Huawei protects your personal data<span class="br-div"></span>

    9. How this Policy is updated<span class="br-div"></span>
    10. International users<span class="br-div"></span>
    11. How to contact Huawei<span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
    Please note that this Policy applies solely to Huawei consumer electronics,  including feature phones, smartphones, tablets, home devices, data cards,  computer applications, tools, software, websites and services that display or  refer to this Policy. <span class="br-div"></span>
    This Policy describes how Huawei handles your personal and private data and  affirms its commitment to protecting your privacy. The Policy does not address  all possible data-processing scenarios. Information about product- or  service-specific data collection is issued by Huawei in supplementary policies.  It is recommended that you read both this Policy and any supplements to fully  understand Huawei's privacy policies for a specific product or service. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>1. How Huawei  uses your personal data</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Personal data is information that can be used on its own or in combination with  other information, to identify an individual. Such data is collected when you  use Huawei products or services and can include your name, date of birth,  address, identity number, telephone number, account number, photo and the  location and date when products or services were accessed. Huawei collects and  uses your personal data solely for the purposes indicated in this Policy. The  following are examples of personal data we may collect and how we use it: <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>1.1 Personal data  collected by Huawei</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    We may collect some personal data, including your name, profile picture, phone  number, email address, age and location. Below are some examples of the types  of personal data we may collect. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (a) Data you submit directly: A number of Huawei services allow you to create  accounts or profiles. You may be requested to provide account information, such  as your email address, delivery address, phone number, product information,  time of purchase and method of payment. If you use Huawei services to share  content with your friends, we may need you to provide their contact  information, including their name, profile picture, phone number and email  address. Some Huawei services allow you to communicate and share information  with other people. All such communications are secure. If you encounter any  errors while using a Huawei device or application, you can choose to send error  details to Huawei. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (b) Service use data: We may collect system and application data from your  devices, including the device name, system and application versions, regional  and language settings, device version, device identification number (IMEI, ESN,  MEID and SN), geographic location (such as the ID of the area where your device  is located), service provider network ID (PLMN), usage habits and IP address.  We may also log your service access times, search query terms and the data  stored in cookies on your devices. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (c) Third party data: We may receive data about you from publicly and commercially  available sources as permitted by law. We may also receive data about you from  third party social networking services, such as when you log in to our websites  using your Facebook or Twitter account. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>1.2 How Huawei uses  your personal data</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    We may use your personal data to:<span class="br-div"></span>
    (a) Fulfil purchase orders; deliver, activate, or verify products or services;  make changes upon your request; and offer technical support. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (b) Contact you; send you information about products and services that may be  of interest; invite you to participate in Huawei promotions and market surveys;  or send you marketing information with your explicit consent. If you don't want  to receive such information, you can opt out at any time. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (c) Inform you about operating system or application updates and install them. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (d) Offer you a personalized user experience and personalized content and  activate your after-sale services. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (e) Carry out internal audits, data analysis and research to improve our  products and services. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (f) Analyse the efficiency of our business operations and measure our market  share. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (g) Improve customer communications and ensure that provide a secure, quality  service to customers. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (h) Troubleshoot errors should you choose to send us error details. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (i) Synchronize, share and store data you upload or download and data required  to implement uploads and downloads. <span class="br-div"></span>
    (j) Improve our loss prevention and anti-fraud programs. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>1.3 Location-based  services</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    When you access certain location-based services, for example, when you perform  a search, use navigation software or check the weather for a specific location,  Huawei may collect, use and process your device's precise or fuzzy location.  This is necessary for Huawei to provide the aforementioned services. Huawei may  collect your device identification numbers (IMEI, ESN, MEID, and SN), device  type, model and real-time location data (obtained through GPS, Wi-Fi and your  service provider's network ID). Huawei collects location data to provide and  improve its location-based products and services. <span class="br-div"></span>
    We may ask you which applications you want location-based services to be  enabled for. You can choose not to share your location data by turning off  location-based services on your devices. For detailed information on how to  disable location-based services, please contact your network operator. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>1.4 Collection and  use of non-identifiable data</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Non-identifiable data refers to data that cannot be used to identify an  individual. For example, Huawei may collect aggregated statistics, such as the  number of visitors to its website. Huawei collects this data to understand how  people use its website, products and services. This allows Huawei to improve  its services to better satisfy customer needs. Huawei may, at its own  discretion, collect, use, process, transfer or disclose non-identifiable data  for other purposes. <span class="br-div"></span>
    We endeavour to keep your personal data and non-identifiable data separate, and  use each independently. If personal data is combined with non-identifiable  data, it will be treated as personal data. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>2. How Huawei uses  cookies and similar technologies</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>2.1 Cookies</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    To ensure that our websites function properly, we sometimes store small data  files known as cookies on computers or mobile devices. A cookie is a simple  text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a web server.  Only the server that creates the cookie can retrieve or read the cookie's  contents. Each cookie is unique to your web browser or mobile application.  Cookies usually contain an identifier, the site name and some numbers and  characters. Cookies allow websites to store data, such as your user preferences  or the contents of your shopping basket. <span class="br-div"></span>
    Most large websites or Internet service providers enable cookies in order to  improve their user experience. Cookies allow websites to remember users, either  for a single visit (using a session cookie) or for repeated visits (using a  persistent cookie). Cookies allow websites to store settings, such as language,  font size and other viewing preferences for your computers or mobile devices.  This means that user preferences do not need to be re-configured on each visit.  If a website doesn't use cookies, it will treat its users as new visitors each  time they open a page. For example, if you log in on a website and move to another  page, the website won't recognize you, and you will be logged out again. <span class="br-div"></span>
    Huawei does not use cookies for any purposes other than those specified in this  Policy. You can manage or delete cookies according to your preferences. For  more information, see <a href="http://aboutcookies.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AboutCookies.org</a>. You can clear all cookies stored on your  computer and most web browsers can be configured to block cookies. However, if  you do so, you may have to manually your user settings every time you visit our  websites. For more information on how to change your browser settings, please  visit the following links: <span class="br-div"></span>
  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260971" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Explorer</a><span class="br-div"></span>
  <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&amp;answer=95647&amp;p=cpn_cookies" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Chrome</a><span class="br-div"></span>
  <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Cookies" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Firefox</a><span class="br-div"></span>
  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safari</a>&nbsp;and<span class="br-div"></span>
  <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/security/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opera</a> <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>2.2 Web beacons and  pixel tags</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    In addition to cookies, we also use other similar technologies such as web  beacons and pixel tags on our websites. For example, when you receive an email  from Huawei, it may contain a click-through URL which links to content on  Huawei's website. If you click the link, the click-through is tracked by Huawei  to help us learn about your product and service preferences and improve our  customer service. A web beacon is typically a transparent image that is  embedded on a website or in an email. The inclusion of pixel tags in emails  allows us to know if our emails have been opened. If you do not want your  activities to be tracked in such a way, you may unsubscribe from Huawei mailing  lists at any time. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>2.3 Do Not Track</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Many web browsers have a Do Not Track feature, which issues Do Not Track  requests to websites. Currently, the main Internet standards organization has  no policy governing how websites should behave when they receive such requests.  However, all Huawei websites do respect the Do Not Track option if it is  enabled in your browser. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>3. How Huawei  discloses your personal data</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Huawei does not sell your personal data to third parties. However, Huawei may  disclose your personal data under the following circumstances: <span class="br-div"></span>
    3.1 Disclosures with explicit consent: After obtaining your explicit approval,  Huawei may share your personal data with other parties. <span class="br-div"></span>
    3.2 Disclosures to Huawei affiliates: Your personal data may be shared with  Huawei's affiliates. As a matter of policy, we will only disclose data that is  necessary. <span class="br-div"></span>
    3.3 Disclosures to authorized partners ("our Partners"): Some Huawei  services are provided by our Partners. Huawei may share some of your personal  data with its Partners to offer better customer service and an improved user  experience. For example, when you purchase Huawei products online, Huawei must  share your personal data with logistics providers to schedule a delivery, or  arrange for Partners to provide services. Your personal data may only be  processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and only the data  that is necessary to offer a service shall be disclosed. Huawei subsidiaries or  Partners are not authorized to use shared personal data for any other purpose. <span class="br-div"></span>
    3.4 Disclosures on legal or reasonable grounds: Huawei may disclose your  personal data if required by the law, legal proceedings, litigation or public  and governmental authorities. In some jurisdictions, your personal data may also  be disclosed to transaction parties if Huawei is involved in a reorganization,  merger or insolvency and liquidation proceedings. Huawei may also disclose your  data where reasonable need can be demonstrated, such as to enforce its terms  and conditions and to protect its customers. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>4. How to access or  modify your personal data</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Under Huawei's terms and conditions, you can manage your personal data, such as  your account information, at any time. You should ensure that all personal data  submitted is accurate. Huawei will make reasonable efforts to keep your  personal data accurate, complete and up-to-date. <span class="br-div"></span>
    You have a right to access your personal data, subject to some legal  exceptions. Where privacy and information laws differ in some jurisdictions, we  will comply with them. If you would like to exercise your right to access data,  please inform us by email at <a href="mailto:consumer_privacy@huawei.com">consumer_privacy@huawei.com</a> . For security reasons, you may be  required to put your request in writing. <span class="br-div"></span>
    You also have the right to delete or amend any personal information about you  that we hold. Huawei will delete or amend such information upon your request.  To make such a request, you can contact us by email at <a href="mailto:consumer_privacy@huawei.com">consumer_privacy@huawei.com</a>. We may decline to process requests if we  have a reasonable basis to believe that they are made in bad faith, are  impractical or if access is not otherwise required by local law. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>5. How Huawei  protects your personal data</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Huawei takes personal data security seriously. We follow industry-standard  practices to safeguard your personal data against unauthorized access,  disclosure, use, modification, damage or loss. We take all reasonably  practicable steps to protect your personal data. For example, we use encryption  to ensure data confidentiality; we use trusted protection mechanisms to protect  data from malicious attacks; we deploy visit control mechanisms to ensure only  authorized personnel can access personal data; and we raise awareness among  employees about the importance of protecting personal data through security and  privacy protection training sessions. <span class="br-div"></span>
    We take all reasonably practicable steps to only collect relevant personal data.  We only retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the  purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required  or permitted by law. While we take the utmost care to protect your personal  data, please note that no security measures are completely infallible. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>6. How Huawei  handles the personal data of children</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Our products, websites and services are primarily intended for adults. Children  are not allowed to create their own user account without the consent of parents  or guardians. Where a child's personal data is collected with parental consent,  we will only use or disclose this data if the law permits it, if explicit  permission is given by parents or guardians or if it is necessary to protect  the child. Although the definition of a child may vary according to local laws  and customs, we consider any person under the age of 13 years to be a child. <span class="br-div"></span>
    If Huawei learns that it has collected a child's personal data without first  obtaining verifiable parental consent, it will take steps to delete the data  within the shortest possible delay. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>7. Third party  providers and their services</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    To ensure a smooth browsing experience, you may be served content or web links  from third parties external to Huawei and our Partners ("Third  Parties"). Huawei does not have control over such Third Parties. You can  choose whether or not to access links, content, products and services offered  by Third Parties. <span class="br-div"></span>
    Huawei has no control over the privacy and data protection policies of Third  Parties, which are not governed by this Policy. Before submitting your personal  information to Third Parties, please refer to their respective privacy  protection policies. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>8. How your personal  data is transferred internationally</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Huawei products and services are delivered through resources and servers  located around the world. This means your personal data may be transferred to  or accessed from other jurisdictions which are outside the country where you  use our products or services. These jurisdictions may have different data  protection laws, or such laws may not even exist. In such cases, Huawei will  ensure that a similar and adequate level of protection is afforded to your data  as required by all applicable laws and regulations. For example, Huawei may  request your consent to transfer personal data across borders, or implement  security measures like data anonymisation prior to cross border data transfers. <span class="br-div"></span>
  <span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>9. How this Policy  is updated</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Huawei reserves its right to update or amend this Policy from time to time.  Huawei will notify you of the changes through various channels. Where changes  are made to our privacy policy, we will post the updated privacy policy on our  website <a href="http://consumer.huawei.com/en" target="_block" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://consumer.huawei.com/en</a> . We may also issue you with a separate  notice (e.g. an electronic notification) informing you of any changes to our  privacy policy. <span class="br-div"></span><span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>10. International  users</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    Please note that personal  information within the scope of Huawei Consumer Cloud Services concerning  individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA) or  Switzerland, Albania, Andorra, Bosnia, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Greenland, Macedonia,  Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, Serbia, Vatican, Japan, Korea, USA,  Canada is controlled by Huawei Technologies Deutschland, GmbH. However, Huawei  online store <a href="http://www.hihonor.com/us">www.hihonor.com/us</a> is controlled by Huawei Device USA, Inc.<span class="br-div"></span><span class="br-div"></span>
  <strong>11. How to contact Huawei</strong><span class="br-div"></span>
    If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please contact us by email  at <a href="mailto:consumer_privacy@huawei.com">consumer_privacy@huawei.com</a> or submit them to one of our global field  offices. For a complete list of our office locations, please visit our website  at: <a href="http://www.huawei.com/en/contact-us" target="_block" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.huawei.com/en/contact-us</a> <span class="br-div"></span>
