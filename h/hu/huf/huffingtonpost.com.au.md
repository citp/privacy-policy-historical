# The Huffington Post Australia Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to The Huffington Post Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 605 765 491) ("The Huffington Post Australia", "we", "our" and "us").

The Huffington Post Australia takes your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy sets out information regarding how we deal with personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs") that is collected from you when you visit The Huffington Post Australia sites and applications (the "Site") or when you otherwise provide personal information to us including; how personal information may be used and disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of personal information; how you can access and correct personal information that we hold about you; how you can make a complaint if you think we have not complied with the APPs or this privacy policy; and how personal information is protected. If you use The Huffington Post Australia mobile applications or sites, additional terms [apply](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/p/huffpost-australia-supplementa.html)("Additional Terms"). If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact our privacy team at [privacy@huffingtonpost.com](mailto:privacy@huffingtonpost.com).

You do not have to provide any personal information to us. However, if you do not provide us with the personal information that we request we may not be able to provide our services to you.

By using the Site, engaging our services, seeking our assistance, providing personal information to us or authorising another person to provide us with personal information, you consent to personal information (including any sensitive information) being collected, held, used and disclosed by us in accordance with this privacy policy.

**1\. Third-party websites and services not covered**  
This privacy policy does not apply to personal information collected through any other website or to the practices of companies that The Huffington Post Australia does not control. Please note that the Site may contain links to other websites. For example, if you click on an advertisement on the Site and link to another website, then this privacy policy will not apply to any personal information collected on that website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites or services, and we recommend that you read the privacy policies of each website that you visit or service you use.

Please note that the Site may combine the information that we collect (which may include personal information) with information we obtain from third-party sources (which may itself include personal information).

If you provide to us the personal information of another person you warrant that you have shown or referred this privacy policy to the person or persons to which the personal information relates and they have consented to such disclosure and to our collection, holding, use and disclosure of the personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.

**3\. How we use the information that we collect**  
We collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for the purposes for which it was provided to us, as set out in this privacy policy and as permitted or required by law ("Purposes"). The Purposes include:

**Email Communications:**  
We may use the personal information that we collect to send you e-mail communications, such as editorial updates, information about your account or changes to the Site, and with your consent promotional messages about our own or our marketing partners' products and services. If you signed up for one of our email newsletters, we also will send you the newsletter that you requested. We note you may unsubscribe from receiving promotional information at any time.

**Mobile Communications:**  
With your consent, we may use your mobile number to send you promotions, notifications, or other services. We note you may unsubscribe from receiving promotional information at any time.

**Advertising:**  
In order to provide our readers with free access to our content, we display advertisements on the Site, many of which are targeted based on information about you. For example, using information (which may include personal information) collected through cookies, web beacons, and other sources, we may use demographic data or information about your online activities or interests (which may include personal information) to display targeted advertising that may be relevant to your preferences. Through this process, advertisers reach Site visitors who are most interested in their products, and you see advertising for products or services in which you may be interested. For more information on how cookies and other technologies work, please see our discussion of[cookies and other technologies](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/p/huffpost-australia-cookies.html).

Third-party advertisers and advertising platforms also may serve targeted ads on the Site. For more information, please see our section on [third party advertising](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/p/huffpost-australia-third-party.html). Please remember that the information practices of third-party advertisers or platforms collecting data on our site are not covered by this privacy policy.

**User Accounts:**  
To provide you with an open, but also civil, discussion forum, we track user involvement in our community discussions. For example, we keep track of the ratio of how many flagged comments are eventually deleted in order to award badges to our most effective comment moderators. For more information on this process, please see our [FAQ section](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/p/huffpost-australia-faqs.html) about comment moderation guidelines.

**Request Fulfillment:**  
We may use personal information that we collect to fulfill your requests for products, services, and information. For example, we may use your contact information to respond to your customer service requests or to enable you to participate in features on the Site such as surveys, polls, sweepstakes, and message boards.

**Statistical Analysis:**  
In order to learn more about how our Site is used, we aggregate and analyze the data that we collect. We may use this information, for example, to monitor and analyze use of the Site, to increase our Site's functionality, and to better tailor our content and design to suit our visitors' needs.

**Enforcement:**  
We may use the information that we collect to prevent illegal activities, to enforce the Site's [Terms of Service](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/p/huffpost-australia-terms.html), and to otherwise protect our rights and the rights of our users.

In addition to the uses identified above, we may use the personal information that we collect for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect personal information, pursuant to your consent and/or as permitted or required by law.

**4\. Information sharing**  
The Huffington Post Australia values your privacy, and discloses personal information only under certain circumstances. We will make personal information about you available to other companies, applications, or people in the circumstances listed below:

• We may disclose personal information to our related entities and corporate partners;  
• We may disclose aggregated information or information that does not directly identify you with third parties to help us develop content, services, and advertising that we hope you will find of interest. Please note that we do not disclose contact information with third parties that advertise on the Site.  
• We may employ third parties to perform Site-related services, including database management, maintenance services, analytics, marketing, data processing, and email and text message distribution. These third parties have access to personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf.  
• If you choose to engage in public activities on the site, such as posting comments on community message boards, any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by others. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in public activities or submissions.  
• We may disclose personal information about you in the event that the Site is acquired by or merged with another company or a similar corporate transaction takes place. However, the Site will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our site or sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account before personal information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  
• We may disclose personal information about you to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of the Site's Terms of Service, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.  
• We may disclose personal information about you to respond to subpoenas, search warrants, judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or other law enforcement measures, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.  
• In addition to the scenarios identified above, we may disclose personal information about you for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect personal information about you or pursuant to your consent.

Please note that third parties may independently collect information about you, including your IP address and other information (which may include personal information) about the websites you visit and the links you click, through cookies, clicks on links, or other means when you visit or view ads on the Site. For more information, see our section on [cookies and other technologies](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/p/huffpost-australia-cookies.html) and [third party advertising](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/p/huffpost-australia-third-party.html).

**5\. Third-party services**  
To customize your experience on the Site and to simplify the Site's registration process, we provide you with the opportunity to access or interact with third-party services, such as Facebook and Twitter. When you connect to the Site through these third-party services, we may disclose personal information about you with these third-party service providers and they may share data about you with us.

When you allow us to access your data through a third-party service to create a Site profile, we may use this data for several purposes, including:

• Creating relationships automatically within our system. For example, if you connect to us via a service with a public friend list, like Twitter, we may check to see if any people you follow on Twitter are also Site members. If we find a match, we will replicate your Twitter relationship with those members, setting them to be fans, followers, or friends on our Site.  
• Suggesting relationships. For example, if you connect via a service that has a private contact list (like Google and Yahoo!), we check for people in your contacts who are Site members and suggest that you become a fan of these users. This process is not automatic; you must affirmatively choose to become a fan of these suggested users.  
• Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send emails. When users share content with their friends using, for example, the forward-to-a-friend feature on the Site, we may use friend lists from third-party services to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send the email message.  
• Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send service-specific messages. For example, we may use friend lists from a third-party service to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send an invitation to view an interactive slideshow.  
• To enhance and personalize your experience on the Site. When you are connected via a third-party service, we may access certain account information, such as your profile picture, what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about certain articles or blog posts, in order to enhance and personalize your experience on the Site.

In addition, if you connect to a Facebook account, your experience on the Site may be personalized. For example, you may automatically see what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about particular stories.

Please note that you may disconnect third party accounts at any time. Click [here](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/?auth=login) for a link to your social profile, where you may set your privacy preferences or disconnect all of your third-party service accounts. You also may be able to modify your privacy settings directly with the third-party service. To modify your Facebook privacy settings, click [here](http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy). To modify your Twitter privacy settings, click [here](https://twitter.com/account/settings).
