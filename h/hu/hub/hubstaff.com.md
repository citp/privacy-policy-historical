# Hubstaff Privacy Policy

Netsoft Holdings, LLC d/b/a as [www.hubstaff.com](https://web.archive.org/) and related web sites ("Hubstaff" or "Website") has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy and protection of personal information that we collect and process. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Hubstaff and its affiliates and subsidiaries. Please note that information collected via access to the Hubstaff’s web sites will also be governed by this policy, but due to the consumer-facing nature of websites, those privacy policies should not be deemed to represent the compressive privacy and protection requirements set forth below. We encourage you to read and become familiar with all applicable Hubstaff privacy policies.

##### 1\. Personal data collection

Hubstaff defines Personal Data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, and an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

Hubstaff collects data and Personal Data in two places, the website ([https://hubstaff.com](https://web.archive.org/)) and our input clients (Mac, Windows, Linux, Chromebook, Android, and iOS).

Our website:

  * Payment information - If you have selected a Hubstaff plan, we will collect your credit card number which will be transmitted via SSL encryption to our merchant provider.
  * Information collected during signup - Name, email, company size, password, phone (optional), and Skype handle (optional).
  * You can optionally upload a photo.



Information collected during setup– Organization name, team size, currency, logo (optional), preferred settings, team member’s email and role.

  * Information about a job offered or desired, your skills and experience, your company or agency, and related information shared through Hubstaff Talent
  * Some of this information can be reviewed and edited on the Account page of Our Website.
  * Automatic Data Collection:
    * As you navigate and interact with our Website, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:
      * Details of your visits to our Website, including traffic data, location data, and other data and the resources that you access and use on the Website.
      * Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type.
    * The information we collect automatically helps us to improve our Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service. Input Devices:
  * Information collected by our desktop applications (Mac, Windows and Linux):
    * Screenshots, applications currently being worked on, web URLs visited, time you are active, the operating system you are using, whether or not you have an input device such as a monitor, whether your mouse is actively moving or not, the names of projects or tasks being worked on, the amount of time worked on those tasks, the browser version you are using, and whether your keyboard is being typed on. Note: Hubstaff is not a keylogging program. It does not know what you are typing; rather, Hubstaff merely records whether your keyboard is active or inactive.
    * All Hubstaff screenshots are uploaded via SSL over the standard HTTPS port (443). Our input clients do all screenshot uploading directly to Amazon S3 (screenshots never pass through our server). We do not upload keystrokes. (We do not even store keystrokes locally.) We upload the total seconds within a 10 min block that there was "activity" and the total seconds "worked" roughly every 10 minutes. This is done via a separate queue within the client which uses SSL (port 443).
    * Additionally, your screenshots are obfuscated on Amazon's servers.
  * Information collected by the Hubstaff mobile app (iOS and Android):
    * Hubstaff uses the GPS device on your phone to store its location and display this on a map at Hubstaff.com and your mobile device. This data is only collected if the mobile app is being used.



User contributions:

You also may provide information to be posted on public areas of the Website, or transmitted to other users of the Website or third parties (collectively, "User Contributions"). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

This Privacy Policy also applies to information that you provide to us in email, text, and other messages. Hubstaff will provide you with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of your personal information before the Hubstaff uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected.

At other times, Hubstaff may collect information that cannot be used to identify you. For example, we may aggregate non-personal information about you and other customers who visit our Web sites. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you.
