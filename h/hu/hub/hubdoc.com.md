We use this personal information to access your online third party accounts on a regular basis and/or on-demand and retrieve any available information to present to you in your mailbox, filing cabinet or elsewhere on the Website. For example, if you provide your login credentials for a third party utility site, we use this information to gather and file your utility bills on www.hubdoc.com. Please note that you may remove your third party account information from our Website whenever you wish.

We may use your comments, suggestions or feedback to monitor and/or improve our product and service offerings and our Website. Please remember that any information that you provide in these comment areas is accessible to the public, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information about yourself or anyone else.

### Disclosure of Personal Information

We will not disclose, trade, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personal information without your consent, except as otherwise set out herein.

 **Service Provider Arrangements:**   We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal information to third parties that provide services on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to host our Website and send out email on our behalf.

Your personal information may be maintained and processed by service providers in the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions, and personal information may be accessed by law enforcement authorities in such jurisdictions. Service providers are provided with the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes.

 **Sale of Business:**   We may transfer any information we have about you as an asset in conjunction with a merger or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings). You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

**Legal:**   Hubdoc and its service providers may provide your personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable Canadian, U.S. or other law. We may also disclose personal information where necessary for the establishment, exercise or a defence of legal claims, or as otherwise permitted by law.

### Additional Information About Our Website

 **Aggregate Data:**   Hubdoc and our third party tracking-utility partners may generate certain non-identifying and aggregate data and store it in log files. We may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to further enhance our services.

 **“Cookies”:**   A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. Hubdoc may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our networks. We may use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. If you decide, however, not to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features offered to you.

 **Third Party Links:**   The Website may contain links to other sites that Hubdoc does not own or operate. Except as provided herein, we do not provide your personal information to these third parties without your consent. We provide these links as a convenience. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you carefully review. We do not have any control over such websites, and therefore have no liability or responsibility for the linked websites’ personal information practices.

### Security of Personal Information

We have implemented measures designed to help protect personal information in our custody and control. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to help protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control. When you provide us with sensitive information (such as your linked account credentials), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No collection or transmission of information over the Internet or other publicly accessible communications networks can be guaranteed to be fully secure, however, and therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at the information at the end of this privacy policy.

### Social Media Feature

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### Access and Removal of Your Personal Information

You have the right to access, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal information in our custody and control, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. You may request access, updating and corrections of inaccuracies by contacting us at the contact information provided below or by logging into your account and making the applicable changes in your Profile. You may also request that we delete a third party account and we will cease collecting personal information from the third party account or your personal information and delete relevant account credentials. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We have personal information retention processes designed to retain personal information of our customers for no longer than necessary for the purposes stated above or to otherwise meet legal requirements.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
