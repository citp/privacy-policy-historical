<p>Your privacy is important to Agile Sports Technologies, Inc. dba Hudl (“<strong>Hudl</strong>”). This Privacy Policy covers how we may collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.</p>





















<h4>1. Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4>





















<p>Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person. We may use personal information to provide our products and services, as well as for purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Hudl’s products, services, and customer communications. You may be asked to provide personal information when in contact with Hudl. Hudl and its partners may share personal information and use it as described in this Privacy Policy. Such information may be combined with other information to provide and improve products, services, content, and advertising. By providing us with personal information about yourself through any means, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of that information, and to us sending you marketing communications related to our products and services. If you do not provide us with requested personal information we may not be able to provide you with some or all of Hudl’s products and services.</p>





















<h4>2. Personal Information We Collect</h4>





















<p>When you visit our websites, download or install a software application, create a registered user account, purchase a product, register a product, complete a survey or download a software update, we may collect information, including: name, mailing address, phone number, email address, athlete profile information (as described in Section 5 below), contact preferences, credit card information and payment history.</p>





















<p>We may also collect such information when you contact us in person (for example, at clinics, conferences, workshops, seminars and other events), via telephone, facsimile or email. When you send us an email, that address will be recorded automatically for purposes of replying to your email. Otherwise, we will use the email address you provide on request for regular communications with you. By providing your email address, you are subscribing to our newsletter and product updates, which may include information about new features and new services. You may unsubscribe from this content by following the steps detailed in the email footer.</p>





















<p>We may receive and store certain types of website usage information when you visit our websites.

We may collect the page visited, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other information about your engagement. We may also collect your IP address and your Device Identifier. A Device Identifier is a number automatically assigned to the computer, cell phone or tablet used to access the Internet.
