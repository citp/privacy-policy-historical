					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><p>
This Privacy Policy applies only to the web sites owned (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices, or otherwise) or controlled by Agile Sports Technologies, Inc. (“Agile Sports,” “we,” “our” or “us”) or other interactive features that are accessible or downloadable through the web sites owned or controlled by Agile Sports and that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Web Sites”). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect on the Web Sites, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you may have regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of such information.</p>

<p>We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Web Sites.

We also may collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to herein as a “Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide. When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Sites, what type of content is most popular, and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.</p>

<p>We may also collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, aggregate information on what pages members access or visit, and information volunteered by the member (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: </p>

<ul>
<li>It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of <a href="/terms/" title="Terms of Service">Terms of Service</a>, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
<li>We transfer information about you if Agile Sports is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Agile Sports will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
<li>We share information with our partners, licensees, agents, representatives, distributors, independent contractors and/or any authorized third party.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Information Gathering and Usage.</h2><p>
When you register for Agile Sports we ask for information such as your name, email address, zip code and date of birth. Agile Sports uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact and research.</p>

<h2>2. Cookies and Web Beacons.</h2><p>
<strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a small amount of data which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.</p>

<p>Cookies are required to use the Agile Sports website. We use cookies to record current session information, but do not use permanent cookies. You are required to login to your Agile Sports member account after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account.</p>

<p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> The Web Sites and any communications sent by the Web Sites may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel “.gif” images) called “web beacons.” These web beacons allow Agile Sports and third parties to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document, e-mail message or other communication, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the Device Identifier of the device that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Agile Sports’ use of web beacons on its Web Sites, include, without limitation, the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>counting unique users (actually, unique web browsers), visits and page views.</li>
<li>monitoring traffic and conversion patterns through our various product and service offerings on the Web Sites. For example, web beacons may be integrated into a merchandise product page as well as the subsequent shopping cart, transaction and verification pages. </li>
<li>personalizing your experience when you visit the Web Sites, including the advertising and content you see.</li>
<li>determining whether or not messages were opened, links were clicked or notifications/offers were acted upon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage.</h2><p>
Agile Sports uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage and related technology required to run the website. Agile Sports owns the code, databases and all rights to therein. Agile Sports incorporates reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your personal information. However, no data transmission over the Internet, or wireless transmission, or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

<h2>4. Disclosure.</h2><p>

Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>

<h2>5. Third Party Ad Networks.</h2><p>
The Web Sites may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Web Sites and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze traffic on the Web Sites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Web Sites and other web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to cookies set by the Web Sites, the Web Sites’ third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser. These third party cookies are set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements are to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.</p>

<h2>6. Third Party Content And Links to other Web Sites.</h2><p>
When you are on the Web Sites you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that are beyond our control. For example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement, the “click” may take you off the Web Sites onto a different web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Web Sites’ logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a web site that is linked from our Web Sites, you should consult that web site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>

<h2>7. Changes.</h2><p>
Agile Sports may periodically update this policy. By using the Web Sites, you acknowledge your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the email address specified in your Agile Sports membership account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>
