The purpose of this procedure is to collect information for demographic data analysis in order to improve offers/services on board. The information will not be connected to individuals. Scanning is voluntary, unless the customer uses the CruiseCard as a purchase card.

When customers call Hurtigruten to make bookings, they are asked to accept that the phone call is recorded. Recordings are used for internal training and as documentation of the entered agreement. The recordings are stored for 5 years.
