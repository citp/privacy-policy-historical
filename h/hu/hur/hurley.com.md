**Collecting Information**

Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use our website. In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track your Internet domain address for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are. For more information, see "Cookies and Pixel Tags" section below. We request information from you (which may include name, address, telephone number, email address, gender and when necessary, credit card information) when you: 

  * Register 
  * Purchase 
  * Request a catalog 
  * Request to receive communications 
  * Participate in a promotion or other website feature 



In order to better understand your preferences and better serve you, we may combine information you give us online with other information from Hurley sources, transactions and communications. This may include data from Hurley stores, direct mail, events, or online marketing. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data that we receive from other reputable sources. This data may include postal address updates and demographic data. We collect information about gift recipients to fulfill the gift purchase, respond to customer service inquiries and for analysis purposes only. All data combined and stored with online data is protected by this privacy policy. 

**Using Information**

We may use the information we collect to: 

  * Customize and/or personalize your communications and shopping experience 
  * Better respond to your customer service inquiries 
  * Communicate with you about your purchase, account information, or customer service needs 
  * Communicate with you about our products and events, and for other promotional purposes 
  * Improve our business 
  * Administer contests, promotions, surveys or other website features 



If you have purchased a product from Hurley and have not previously registered on the website as of May 6, 2005, we may add you to our direct mail (including catalog) list. 

**Sharing Information**

We do not sell or rent your information to any outside parties. For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer information between Hurley and our preferred service providers who use that information only to conduct Hurley business. For example, they may handle Hurley's credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. We may also share your information to administer a website feature (e.g., music download or event registration) and in that case will notify you before you give us your information. We provide our preferred service providers with the information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your information. 

We may provide your information to companies affiliated with Hurley, which may be outside the U.S. We may provide aggregated, non-personally identifiable information to other companies for purposes such as reporting and marketing. 

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes. 

**Protecting Your Information**

We use a variety of security measures, including sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

**Cookies and Pixel Tags**

A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies allow you to place an order on our website and allow us to enhance and personalize your online surfing and shopping experience.
