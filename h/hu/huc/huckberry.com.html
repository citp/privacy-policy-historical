<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Huckberry.com has developed this privacy policy to let you know how we collect and use the personal information you provide to us while visiting our web site (the "Site"). By visiting the Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We collect personally identifying information that you provide us during the registration process, such as your name, email address, gender, zip code and date of birth. We also collect personal identifying information when you choose to use certain other features of the Site, such as when you order a product or service from us or our partners, and when you otherwise volunteer personal information about yourself, for example, through surveys, contests or promotions, and submitting and/or posting content in discussion forums. When you choose to use these additional features, we may require you to provide additional personal information such as your phone number, billing and shipping addresses and credit card information.</p>
<p>In addition, through the Site, we automatically gather certain non-personally identifiable information about the use of the Site, such as how frequently certain areas of the Site are visited, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies. This gives us valuable information about your customer shopping experience and is used only to improve your experience with our website. Most browsers can be set to prevent cookies or to notify you when one is being placed. It is not necessary to have cookies turned on to visit our Site, but without them, your access to some areas may be limited and certain features, including shopping features, may not be available to you.</p>
<p>If you choose to invite an individual to join Huckberry.com, you will need to provide his/her email address. Huckberry may store this information to confirm qualifying orders attributable to your account and to track the results of the invitation referrals.</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Information </h3>

We may also track your past purchases to provide you with a personalized profile of your purchase history. The personal information you provide to us will also be added to our databases and used for future weekly communications regarding new travel and product offerings or other special promotions. If you wish not to receive these weekly emails you may remove yourself from our list by logging into your account, and modifying your email delivery options. By registering with Huckberry.com, you are automatically subscribed to our weekly email, but may choose to opt out of our weekly email list at any time.</p>
<h3>Access to Personal Information </h3>
<p>We may permit certain trusted third parties to access your information in connection with their performance of services to maintain and operate the Site and certain features on the Site. For example, we may use third parties to host the Site; operate various features available on the Site; send emails; analyze data; provide search results and links and assist in fulfilling your orders.</p>
<p>To provide services you have requested, it may be necessary to provide your personal information to Huckberry merchants and or service providers in order to aid redemption of services requested. Logistics services may utilize supplied information only for completing your delivery.</p>
<p>We may transfer personally identifiable information as an asset in connection with a proposed or actual merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale, membership transfer, or other change in control.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use or disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to protect you, to comply with legal process or the instructions of legal authorities, to respond to any claims, to enforce our legal rights, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of ourselves, our employees, you, or members of the public.</p>
<p>If you use a bulletin board, chat room or any other publicly accessible area of the Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected or used by any person for any purpose. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable or other information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<p>We may use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate, so that we can improve the Site and for business and administrative purposes. We may also use or share with third parties for any purpose aggregated data that contains no personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
Additionally, we may provide links on our Site to websites controlled by third parties. We have no control over these websites and our privacy policy does not apply to these third party websites. Please consult the privacy policy of the website you are visiting.

<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
<p>We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
<p>The Site uses security measures in order to protect from the loss, misuse and alteration of any information under our control. All orders are transmitted over secure internet connections using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology. In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access.</p>

Please indicate your name, address and email address, and what information you would like to update when you contact us.</p>
<h3>Children's Privacy and Parental Controls </h3>
<p>We do not solicit any personal information from children. If you are not 18 or older, you are not authorized to use the Site. Parents should be aware that there are parental control tools available online that you can use to prevent your children from submitting information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy for the Site, we will post the revised Privacy Policy here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we may disclose it to anyone.

If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
