**Notice Regarding Hughes’ Position on Child Pornography**

Hughes takes its commitment to protect children from exploitation over the Internet extremely seriously. Consequently, Hughes is working hand-in-hand with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other law enforcement agencies on this important project. One of the efforts that Hughes has undertaken in this regard is to establish a specially designated email address, [cp-abuse@hughes.net](mailto:cp-abuse@hughes.net), for complaints about child pornography. Hughes further commits that all complaints received shall be investigated promptly, generally within three (3) business days or less. No Hughes facilities or services may be used by in any fashion for the transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography.

**Security**

Hughes employs reasonable measures to protect your personal information against acquisition by unauthorized persons.

**Questions**

Please direct questions, concerns, or comments about this Privacy Policy to our email address at guest.services@hughes.com.
