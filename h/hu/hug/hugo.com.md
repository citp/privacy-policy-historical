**Interest Based Advertising**

Where legally permitted, you may receive P&G interest-based ads as you interact with websites on the internet. P&G Interest-based ads are advertisements for P&G [_brands_](http://www.pg.com/en_US/brands/index.shtml) or our carefully selected business partners that we hope you find more relevant to your interests. We serve interest based ads according to certain general interest categories that we have inferred based on information such as: 

  * The web pages you view and links you click on P&G websites and other websites you visit.
  * The P&G brand emails you view and links you click in the email.
  * Demographic data.
  * Offline purchase data, which may be combined with your online website activity to create a better profile of your interests. For example, if you purchase diapers at the grocery store, you may receive an ad with a coupon for Pampers.



We have designed our interest based advertising systems to deliver ads to you based only on data that does not personally and directly identify you.

**We respect your privacy.**  
If you don’t want to receive interest-based ads visit the[ _About Ads_](http://www.pg.com/en_US/privacy/en_na/oba_notice.shtml) link on our websites in the United States and Canada, where you can choose to opt out. P&G will honor that choice.

You can also opt out of receiving interest-based ads by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s website at:

The success of our business depends on your trust, and we do not sell your personal information to marketers outside of P&G. We share your personal information only as described below and within P&G. 

In general, we do not share personal information with marketers outside of P&G unless we have clearly asked for and obtained your explicit consent.

**Third-party service providers.** We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf. In so doing, we may need to share your personal information with them. Please note that we provide our service providers with only the personal information they need to perform their services and we require that they protect this information and not use it for any other purpose. 

For example, we may rely on a service provider to: 

  * Fulfill your product and service requests and answer your questions.
  * Host our sites and deliver our email and mobile messages.
  * Mail product samples, contact contest winners, manage payments or take other actions on our behalf.
  * Analyze data, sometimes combined with other sources, to send more targeted communications to you.

**  
In addition, where permitted by law, we may also rely on a service provider to:  
**

  * Combine personal information about you that P&G has collected with personal information about you that our business partner has collected so we can jointly send tailored promotional communications to you. In such instances, our business partner will not have direct access to any information we share about you with the service provider, and only the service provider will be allowed to use the combined set of information to send you joint communications that we hope will be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these joint communications, you can always opt out by following the instructions provided in any such communication or through this Privacy Statement as indicated above
  * Perform other services that we request.



We provide these companies with the personal information they need to provide these services on our behalf. We require these companies to protect this personal information and to not use the information for any other purpose. 

**Other situations.** We may disclose your personal information: 

  * If a P&G brand is sold to another company.
  * Where permitted by law, to protect and defend the rights and property of P&G (including enforcing our Terms and Conditions).
  * And when required by law, and/or public authorities.



**Aggregated and non-personal information.** We may share aggregated information that cannot identify you for general business analysis. For example, we may disclose the number of visitors to P&G sites or services.
