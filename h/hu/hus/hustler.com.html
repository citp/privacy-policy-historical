LFP Internet Group, LLC. (“LFP”) has created this privacy statement in order to
demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information
gathering and dissemination practices for the websites operated by us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you
arrive at or leave our website, we automatically receive the IP address of the
site that you came from or are going to. We use IP addresses primarily to
optimize website presentation, control website access, and improve server
performance. IP addresses may also be used to help identify visitors and to
gather broad demographic information. We also collect information on which
pages of our website you visit while you are on our website, the type of
browser you use and the times you access our website. We use this information
only to try to understand our member/ subscriber's preferences better and to
manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your
experience with our website.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><br>
<br>
"Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and
allow us to recognize you as a member, subscriber or prior visitor if you
return to our website using the same computer and browser. We send a "session
cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your membership account
by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to
recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session,
so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log
out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any
effect. <br>
<br>
We also may use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our
sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each time
when you log in to your membership account. In addition, we use cookies to
process our referral program, described in Section C below. Our cookie files
are encoded so that your e-mail address and other information can only be
interpreted by LFP. We may, however, share cookie information regarding whether
or not a certain user is already registered with LFP with certain merchants,
partners and third-parties with <span class="GramE">whom</span> we have an
official relationship.<br>
<br>
Subscription/purchase forms on our websites collect contact and financial
information. Contact information is primarily used to communicate with members/
subscribers when necessary about membership, product or billing-related
concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contact information may also
be used to convey promotional opportunities from us or our LFP Internet-approved
partners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Financial information that is
collected is used to check the users' qualifications and to bill the user for
products and services ordered. We may disclose information that we in good
faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other
illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our User
Agreement. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and
conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that
person or entity's contact information (but not credit card information) to
victims who request it. Furthermore, we do disclose information in response to
a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed
receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private
parties in a civil action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

margin-left:18.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Our
websites often contain links to other websites (“third-party websites”). LFP is
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other such
websites.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Transactions that occur
between the User and third parties are strictly between the User and the third
party and are not the responsibility of LFP. Furthermore, we are not
responsible for the availability, privacy practices, policies or content of
third party websites. Any concerns regarding third-party websites should be
directed to the respective administrator(s) of such third-party website(s). <br>
<br>
Websites operated by LFP may contain chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or
news groups. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these
areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding
to disclose your personal information.</span></p>

the United States
may be less stringent than the laws of your country but LFP will hold and
transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential and secure
