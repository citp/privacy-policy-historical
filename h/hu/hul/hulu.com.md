# Hulu - Privacy

## Information Collected About You

What kinds of information does Hulu collect about me?

Generally speaking, we may collect the following information about you when you use the Hulu Services:

  * information you give us, including your name, email address, birth date, gender, and––if you subscribe to Hulu Plus––your credit card information;
  * information automatically collected when you use the Hulu Services, such as your location and information collected via cookies, web beacons, or other technologies;
  * information from other commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or our business partners, which may include your interests, purchasing behavior and your activities online, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed.



We may combine all of the information we collect about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.

Are there other parties collecting information about me that I should be aware of while using the Hulu Services?

  * Other websites. The Hulu Services may be linked to or provided through Internet websites or other platforms operated by other companies. Some of these websites or platforms may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. Hulu is not responsible for the privacy practices of the websites or platforms operated by third parties. Once you have left Hulu.com by clicking on a link, or if you are using the Hulu Services on another website or platform, you should check the privacy policy of the other website or platform to determine how it handles any information it collects from you.
  * Social Networking Services. You can use the Hulu Services on third-party social networks, such as Facebook, and connect with third-party social networks through the Hulu Services. With your consent, Hulu may send the social networking service information about you, including information about your use of the Hulu Services. These social networking services also may collect certain technical information about you, such as the IP address of the device you are using to access the Hulu Services and the URL of the page you are viewing. For more information about how Hulu works with social networking services, please click here.
  * Third-Party Advertisers. Hulu carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies. These companies may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Hulu Services in order to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content. For more information about third-party advertising and Hulu, please click here.



  
  


## How We Use Your Information

How does Hulu use the information it collects about me?

  * Payment Information. We only use payment information, such as credit card numbers, as necessary for completing a particular transaction or fulfilling a service (for example, processing payments from our Hulu Plus subscribers) and to prevent abuse of the Hulu Services.
  * Other information. We use the other information we collect about you in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you and to help deliver a first-class user experience. Hulu's use of this information includes the following general purposes: contacting you; customizing the content and advertising you view; fulfilling your requests for products or services; identifying the comments you post when you use the Hulu Services; improving our services; conducting research; compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; preventing potentially illegal activities; protecting our rights; and other uses in accordance with our Terms of Use; and for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information.
  * Promotional Communications. We may use your information to:
    * provide you with promotional information about Hulu's features, services, and other offerings that may be of interest to you; or
    * provide information or offers to you that are related to the Hulu Services on behalf of Hulu's business partners.



Information about your choices regarding promotional communications you receive from Hulu are described in the “Your Choices” section.

What information is stored as user IDs?

We transitioned our user IDs on the Hulu Services to reflect a user's full first and last name on June 26, 2009. If you previously used a user ID on Hulu.com or in connection with the Hulu Services that does not include your full name (such as your first name and last initial, or another name you created in the past), that user ID will be replaced with your first and last name if you have registered with Hulu or otherwise accepted the terms of our Privacy Policy in effect since June 26, 2009. Please note that you are not required to agree to have this information appear as your user ID, but if you do not agree, you will not be able to access some of the Hulu Services. Once you have included your full name in your user ID, you will not be able to remove it, but you can always terminate your Hulu account if you wish to do so via the link accessible on your [Account & My Profile page](https://web.archive.org/profile), or [here](https://web.archive.org/users/delete).

  
  


## How We Share Your Information

With whom does Hulu share the information it collects about me?

  * Other Hulu Users. Information that you voluntarily make public, including by making it a part of your user ID or posting it in a review or discussion on the Hulu Services, will be shared with other Hulu users. You can control the sharing of certain information contained in your Hulu profile or about your activities on the Hulu Services with others on the Privacy and Settings page.
  * Business Partners. Only with your consent will we share your information with advertisers, business partners, and other entities that are not affiliated with Hulu who would like to send you promotional information about their products and services directly.
  * Social Networking Services. You can use the Hulu Services on third-party social networks, such as Facebook, and connect with third-party social networks through the Hulu Services. With your consent, Hulu may send the social networking service information about you, including information about your use of the Hulu Services. For more information about how Hulu works with social networking services, please click here.
  * Service Providers. We may also share your information with companies that provide services to us, including companies that assist with payment processing, business analytics, data processing, account management, advertising, and other services. We require these companies to agree that they will only use information about you that they have obtained from us to provide us with specific services that we have requested and not for any other purpose. Similarly, we may share your information with other people or entities in order to provide goods or services that you have requested or to complete a transaction at your request. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive while using the Hulu Services. Your information, including clickstream data about your use of the Hulu Services, may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. Our agreement with these companies restricts them from sharing your information with third parties or using it for any other purpose. 
  * Other Parties When Required By Law or When Necessary to Protect Your Rights or Ours. There may be instances when we may disclose your information without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Hulu or its affiliates, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents, and suppliers; to protect the safety and security of users of the Hulu Services or to enforce our Terms of Use; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required. If you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by Hulu or another user of the Hulu Services, we may provide the information that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint. For instance, if you submit a notice of copyright infringement to us, we may send a copy to the person or entity who uploaded, stored, or transmitted the material addressed by the communication.
  * Other Parties In Connection With a Transfer of Assets. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we will transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.



How does Hulu use and share aggregate data?

  * How we use aggregate data. Aggregate data is information that we collect on an individualized basis (for example, statistics about which videos you watch) but subsequently use in aggregate form (that is, in a way that combines information about individuals together so that no individual is identifiable). We may use aggregate data for a variety of purposes, including for research or analysis, website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes. 
  * How we share aggregate data. We may share aggregate information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities. For example, IP addresses are used for system administration and to provide anonymous aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Hulu Services and the specific Hulu Services in which users are most interested. We also may share information about our users with advertisers so they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the Hulu Services. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.



  


Do I have choices about Hulu's use and sharing of the information it collects about me?

You have choices about our use and sharing of certain information that we collect about you. 

  * Other Hulu Users. Hulu’s [Privacy and Settings page](https://web.archive.org/profile/settings) gives you the option to control how certain information in your profile (other than your first and last name) and how your activities are shared when you use the Hulu Services. Please note that some of your settings are set to share information with others, including when you choose to connect with a social networking service, such as Facebook or Twitter. You can change your privacy settings at any time on the [Privacy and Settings page](https://web.archive.org/profile/settings).
  * Business Partners: Only with your consent will we share your information with third-party business partners so you can receive promotional emails directly from them. We also may ask for your consent when you choose to engage with a service offered by one of our business partners either separately or in conjunction with Hulu. By providing consent, you give Hulu permission to share your contact information with those business partners.
  * Social Networking Services. Hulu’s [Privacy and Settings page](https://web.archive.org/profile/settings) allows you to control whether your profile information (other than your first and last name) and your activities on the Hulu Services are published to social networking services.
  * Hulu’s Use of Your Information to Send You Promotional Materials. By visiting the [Privacy and Settings page](https://web.archive.org/profile/settings), you may opt out of receiving alerts or email updates from Hulu promoting our site or the products or services of our business partners, or notices about your queues or subscribed content. We updated these settings on November 19, 2010. If you affirmatively instructed us not to send you promotional materials prior to that date, we maintained that preference following the change. But if you didn’t give us an affirmative instruction or want to change your preference, you can do so on the [Privacy and Settings page](https://web.archive.org/profile/settings). Regardless of your choices with respect to promotional communications and updates regarding content, we may send you administrative messages, service announcements, terms and conditions of your account, or other similar communications, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
  * Terminating Your Hulu Account. You may terminate your Hulu account, in accordance with our Terms of Use, via the link accessible on the [Privacy and Settings page](https://web.archive.org/profile/settings), or [here](https://web.archive.org/users/delete). Hulu Plus subscribers should review our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms) for our policies on cancellations and refunds, available [here](https://web.archive.org/terms). Please note that, if you terminate your account, we may retain some information about you.



  
  


## Security, Kids, and Other Information

How does Hulu protect the information it collects about me?

We use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. For example, passwords and other sensitive information are encrypted in transit. We also take steps to ensure that only those Hulu employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your information are granted access

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information on our order forms), we encrypt that information using secure sockets layer technology (SSL), an industry standard protocol for billing transmission in order to protect the financial information you send us. We store your payment information in encrypted form.

Despite these efforts, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We want you to feel confident using the Hulu Services but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Please refer to the U.S. [Federal Trade Commission's website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data/idt.shtm) for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

Do you collect information from children under the age of 13?

Hulu prohibits registration or subscription by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age.

Do any special considerations apply to visitors from outside the United States?

Hulu is an online video service based in the U.S., and our offices are headquartered in the U.S. Please be aware that information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of the Hulu Services may be processed and transferred to the U.S. and be subject to U.S. law. The privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. By using our website, participating in any of the Hulu Services, or by providing us with your information, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S.

What happens when Hulu changes its Privacy Policy?

From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law or to the scope of the Hulu Services or for other reasons. Therefore, it is important to check the effective date of the Privacy Policy posted at [http://www.hulu.com/privacy](https://web.archive.org/privacy) each time you visit Hulu.com or use any of the Hulu Services to ensure you are familiar with the most updated policies and practices. If we make any material revisions to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting notice on Hulu.com or by sending you an email to the email address you most recently provided to us prior to such revisions taking effect. If the material revisions concern practices where we have represented that we will obtain your consent to use or disclose your personally identifiable information, we will obtain your consent before taking any action inconsistent with those representations.

## Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies

How does Hulu protect the information it collects about me?

  * Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website or other platform. For example, cookies can store your session for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited. They enable us to make your use of the Hulu Services more enjoyable.
    * For example, we may display targeted advertisements based on your activities in connection with the Hulu Services, which we obtain through cookies and other information about you that we have collected, such as your interests. 
    * We also may use cookies and similar technologies to relate your use of the Hulu Services to information we obtain from you or from reputable third parties, and to compile aggregate data. For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, cookie or clickstream data about your activities using the Hulu Services may allow us to limit the materials we send to you to items that we believe will be of interest to you, based on your prior online activities and preferences. 
    * You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, unless you accept cookies, you will not have access to certain Hulu Services.
    * Some advertisements displayed in connection with the Hulu Services also may contain cookies or other technologies set by third party Internet advertisers (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"). For more information on this topic, please see our discussion of Third Party Advertising on Hulu.
  * “Flash cookies” In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as ”flash cookies,” in connection with the Hulu Services, including the video player. These cookies are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content, including advertisements that we serve, on our website. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable them, please click here: <http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html>. Please note that disabling flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of the video player.
  * Web beacons. We also may use services that collect data remotely by using so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags"), which can be embedded in content and advertising on the Hulu Services, in an email message, or on a third party's website or other platform. A Pixel Tag is a small string of code that provides a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Pixel Tags can recognize certain types of information on your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Pixel Tag, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Pixel Tag was viewed. We use Pixel Tags to improve your Hulu experience, including to provide you with content customized to your interests.



  


## Social Networking Services

Hulu enables you to connect with certain third-party social networking services through the Hulu Services. With your consent, we may share information about your activities on Hulu with those services and their users. This section provides information on this sharing.

  * If you connect with one of these services, you will be able to publish information about your activities on the Hulu Services, such as your comments or the videos you watch, to that service by adjusting your settings on the [Privacy and Settings](https://web.archive.org/profile/settings) page. Please note that when you choose to publish your information from Hulu.com or another website or platform to social networking services, that information will be visible to users of those services, in accordance with applicable law and the privacy policies of those services. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the services’ privacy policies and privacy controls. 
  * In addition, if you visit Hulu.com while logged into one of these services, the third-party service provider may be able to identify you and to associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information the service already has about you. 



Hulu also may offer the Hulu Services on social networking websites and platforms. If you use the Hulu Services on a social networking website or platform, your Hulu profile information and information about your use of the Hulu Services will be shared with the social networking service and users of that service, in accordance with applicable law and the privacy policies of the services. 

  


Hulu carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies.

  * Clicking on Ads. When you click on an advertisement, the advertiser may collect some information from you. Hulu is not responsible for the privacy practices of advertisers. You should check the privacy policy of the advertiser whose website you visit to determine how it handles any information it separately collects from you. Please be aware that Hulu does not warn you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Hulu Services.
  * "Third-Party “Ad Networks.” Some of the advertisements that appear in connection with the Hulu Services may be delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"). These companies may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Hulu Services in order to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content. The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. 
  * Information Shared with Advertisers and Ad Networks. Hulu may share aggregate information with our advertisers so they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed in connection with the Hulu Services. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.
  * Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising. Some of these advertising companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing companies that offers a centralized tool for opting out of behavioral advertising delivered by each of its member companies. If you would like to obtain more information about the NAI and make choices about their members’ use of your information, please click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the [DAA consumer opt out page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).
