# Hulu - Privacy

Hulu, LLC ("Hulu," "we" or "us") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. We take your privacy very seriously and make it a priority to protect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number that we obtain from and about individuals both online and off-line. Please take a moment to review this Privacy Policy which describes how Hulu collects, uses, and shares this and other information. 

Hulu provides an online video service that offers a selection of television shows, movies, clips, and other content (collectively, "Content") that are made available on the Hulu.com website (the "Hulu Site"), Hulu's affiliate and distributor websites ("Distribution Sites"), and other websites where users may embed the Content (these websites, together with the Hulu Site and Distribution Sites, are referred to collectively as the "Sites"). The Content is available also for permissible viewing through Hulu authorized applications or features. Our video service, including the Content and our video player, and any other features, tools, applications, materials, or other services offered from time to time by Hulu in connection with its business on any of the Sites are referred to collectively as the "Hulu Services." We are a website based in the United States. 

By visiting the Hulu Site (whether or not you are a registered member) or using any of the Hulu Services on any of the Sites, you are accepting this Privacy Policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Hulu Services. 

The Hulu Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. 

We invite you to click below to get answers to your questions regarding our Privacy Policy. 

Hulu collects personally identifiable information — meaning information that can be used to identify and contact you — when you use the Hulu Services. Hulu may combine information about you that we collect with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 

When you register on our website, we may ask for personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, address, city and state of residence, and ZIP code. From time to time, we may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving Hulu the permission to use and store it consistent with this Privacy Policy. Therefore, please understand when you sign in with Hulu, you are not anonymous to us. 

In addition, Hulu collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners. For example, Hulu automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, software and hardware attributes, the page you request, and cookie information. For more information on cookies, please refer to the section titled What are cookies, and how are they and other technologies used to collect information?. 

Hulu collects personally identifiable information in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. Also, it helps us deliver a first class user experience. Hulu's use of this information includes the following general purposes: contacting you, customizing the content and advertising you view, fulfilling your requests for products or services, identifying the comments you post on the Hulu Site, improving our services, conducting research, and compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes. 

Cookies are small bits of information placed on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. For example, cookies can store your session for easy sign-in to a website you have previously visited. They enable us to make your visits to the Hulu Site more enjoyable. Information about your activities on the Hulu Site, which we obtain through cookies, and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to serve you online ads that we believe are consistent with your interests. 

Hulu may display targeted advertisements based on information about you, such as your interests. Hulu does not provide any personally identifiable information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad, although advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. 

Some advertisements displayed in connection with the Hulu Services also may contain cookies set by third party internet advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of the Hulu Services should check the privacy policy of the entity who is delivering the ad and the entity whose ad is displayed to understand whether and how they use cookies. For more information on this topic, please refer to the section titled Are there other parties collecting information about me that I should be aware of while using the Hulu Services?.

We may use cookies and similar technologies to relate your use of the Hulu Services to personally identifiable information we obtain from you or from reputable third parties, and to compile aggregate data (as described below). For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, cookie or clickstream data about your activities using the Hulu Services may allow us to limit the materials we send to you to items that we believe will be of interest to you, based on your prior online activities and preferences.

We also may use services that collects data remotely by using so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags"), which can be embedded on the Hulu Site or on a third party's website. A Pixel Tag is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to users but allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page. Pixel Tags collect only a limited set of information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Pixel Tag resides. You may not decline Pixel Tags, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. 

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, unless you accept cookies you will not have access to certain Hulu Services.

Aggregate data is information (originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may use aggregate data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research about customer demographics, internet use, and interests and behavior based on personally identifiable information we gather. Although aggregate data may be based in part on personally identifiable information about you (for example, we may want to know the general age range of visitors watching videos on our site), it does not identify you personally. Hulu may share this type of aggregate data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers and other current and prospective business partners. But because this form of data does not identify particular users, these third parties will not be able to contact you based solely on this data. 

We may use aggregate data collected for website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes, and we may share this information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities. For example, IP addresses are used for the purposes of system administration and to provide anonymous aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Hulu Services. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive while using the Hulu Services. Your non-personally identifiable information and clickstream data about your activities may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. Our agreement with these companies restricts them from sharing your information with third parties or using it for any other purpose. Clickstream and demographic information may also be shared with our advertisers and business partners. 

This Privacy Policy is our primary disclosure to you of when and how your information may be used. At times, however, we may choose or be required by law to provide you with additional notice. 

You may, at your option, disclose your own personally identifiable information or other information by any means you choose, including, without limitation: (i) registering with Hulu; (ii) setting up a profile on the Hulu Site; (iii) participating in surveys or otherwise providing information directly to Hulu; (iv) sending emails or other written or electronic communications to Hulu; and (v) posting information on areas of the Hulu Site that may be viewed by other users or the public. 

We will obtain your consent to send you email messages from Hulu and our business partners about special promotions. Whether you opt in or later opt out of receiving these communications from Hulu, we reserve the right to send you administrative messages, service announcements, and other similar communications without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. This is important in case we need to communicate with you about items such as your account, website maintenance, and other non-promotional matters. From time to time, you may be given an opportunity to indicate your preferences regarding various account settings, communication preferences, or other information related to your account. For example, if you wish to receive additional communications relevant to you, such as alert messages about your favorite content, you will need to elect to receive them. Therefore, please take that opportunity to review and select your preferences carefully. If you are signed in as a registered user, you can change your privacy settings at any time by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/users/settings), but please note, your first name, last name, image, city and state of residence cannot be set to "private." Please see the section below titled How does Hulu use my personally identifiable information?. 

We will use the personally identifiable information you provide to us in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

We use your _first name and last name_ as your user ID on the Hulu Site and in connection with the Hulu Services. Therefore, if you register with Hulu and provide this form of personally identifiable information, as well as your image, city and state of residence to Hulu, such personally identifiable information may be viewed by other users or the public. Please note if you accept this Privacy Policy either upon registration or when otherwise requested when accessing the Hulu Services, any other user ID (such as first name and last initial, or another name you created in the past) will be replaced by your first and last name. This means that your prior user ID will be replaced by your first and last name anywhere on the Hulu Site where your prior user ID appeared (such as in connection with posts and comments). In addition, this information as well as your image, city and state of residence will be revealed anytime you post information to the Hulu Site. Please note that you are not required to agree to have this information appear as your user ID, but if you do not agree you will not be able to access some of the Hulu Services. 

Only if you have given Hulu consent, we may (i) use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information about Hulu's features, services, and other offerings that may be of interest to you; (ii) provide information or offers to you on behalf of Hulu's business partners (please note that if we were to do this, we would not give those partners personally identifiable information, such as your name or address); or (iii) share your personally identifiable information with advertisers, business partners, and other entities that are not affiliated with Hulu who would like to send you information about their products and services directly. 

Under certain circumstances (for example, if you win a contest), we may post your personally identifiable information on the Hulu Site. However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personally identifiable information or we will obtain your consent. 

We may also share your personally identifiable information with companies that provide services to us, including outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (for example, contest and sweepstakes administration), but they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose. Similarly, we may share your personally identifiable information with other people or entities in order to provide goods or services that you have requested or to complete a transaction at your request. 

There may be instances when we may disclose personally identifiable information without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Hulu or its affiliates, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents, and suppliers; to protect the safety and security of users of the Hulu Services or to enforce our Terms of Use; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with or respond to the law or legal process, whether or not legally required. If you submit a Notice of Copyright Infringement pursuant to the Terms of Use, we will send a copy to the person or entity who uploaded, stored, or transmitted the material addressed by the communication. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of backruptcy, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a third party as part of that transaction. 

We use reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. For example, passwords and other sensitive information are encrypted in transit. We also take steps to ensure that only those Hulu employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your personally identifiable information are granted access. 

Despite these efforts, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We want you to feel confident using the Hulu Services but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Please refer to the [U.S. Federal Trade Commission's web site](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data/idt.shtm) for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft. 

The Hulu Services may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. For example, users can use the Hulu Services on the Distribution Sites. Hulu is not responsible for the privacy practices of the Distribution Sites or other websites operated by third parties that are linked to any of the Sites. Once you have left the Hulu Site by clicking on a link, or if you are using the Hulu Services on another website, you should check the privacy policy of the other website to determine how it handles any personally identifiable information it collects from you.

Hulu carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites run by these other companies. Hulu is not responsible for the privacy practices of advertisers. Once you have left the Hulu Site by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to determine how it handles any personally identifiable information they collect from you. Please be aware that Hulu does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website from the Hulu Site.

Some of the advertisements that appear in connection with the Hulu Services may be delivered to you by third party internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"). These companies may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Hulu Site in order to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content. Hulu does not have access to or control over cookies, web beacons or other technologies that they may use. The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you would like to obtain more information about the practices of some of these network advertisers and to make choices about their use of your information, please click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Hulu is headquartered in the U.S. Please be aware that information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of the Hulu Services may be processed and transferred to the U.S. and be subject to U.S. law. The privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. By using our website, participating in any of the Hulu Services, or by providing us with your information, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S. 

From time to time, Hulu may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law or to the scope of the Hulu Services or for other reasons. Therefore, it is important to check the effective date of the Privacy Policy posted at <http://www.hulu.com/privacy> each time you visit the Hulu Site or use any of the Hulu Services to ensure you are familiar with the most updated policies and practices. If we make any material revisions to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting notice on the Hulu Site or by sending you an email to the email address you most recently provided to us prior to such revisions taking effect. If the material revisions concern practices where we have represented that we will obtain your consent to use or disclose your personally identifiable information, we will obtain your consent before taking any action inconsistent with those representations.
