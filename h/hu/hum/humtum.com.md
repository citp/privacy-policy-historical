# HumTum.com - Indian Dating and Matrimonials

Information Collection and Use

Registration  
In order to create a profile on HUMTUM.COM you must first complete the registration form and create a user name/password.  During registration you are required to give contact information such as your name and email address.  We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest (See Operational Communications).  

Information you choose to disclose to HUMTUM.COM falls into two categories:  Public and Private Information -

    Public Information:  
Information that falls under this category is information that can be seen by all users of HUMTUM.COM.  This includes, but is not limited to, username, gender, age, religion, and all other information that the user chooses to put on his/her profile

    Private Information:  
Information that falls under this category is information that can only be seen by the user and HUMTUM.COM representatives.  This includes, but is not limited to, first name, last name, credit card number, checking account information for payment, user-specified password, mailing address, zip code, and telephone number

HUMTUM.COM is the sole owner of the information collected on HUMTUM.COM.  We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site (See Information Sharing and Disclosure).

Orders  
If you purchase services from HUMTUM.COM, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form.  You must provide both contact and financial information.  We use this information ONLY for billing purposes and to fill your orders.  If we have difficulty processing an order we will also use this information to contact you.

Surveys or Contests  
Occasionally, we may provide the user with opportunities to participate in contests or surveys on our site.  If you choose to participate, HUMTUM.COM will request certain personally identifiable information from you.  Participation in these surveys or contest is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this private information, which typically includes contact and demographic information.  We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, gain user feedback on our functionality, and send participants emails and other Operational Communications.  We may use a third party provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our user’s personally identifiable information for any other purpose.  We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice (See Information Sharing and Disclosure).

Uses of Information  
HUMTUM.COM collects information from its members and does not sell any information to third parties.  HUMTUM.COM uses your email address for confirmation emails, important news, and other operational communications as well as exclusive discounts and offers.  Except when you are expressly informed, HUMTUM.COM does not sell, rent, share, trade, or give away any of your personal information except to the financial institution that processes your credit card information.  HUMTUM.COM may share your personal information with their agents or representatives in order to enhance the services it provides.  HUMTUM.COM uses your financial information to check your qualifications, to bill you for products and services, and to enable you to participate in discount or rebate programs.  HUMTUM.COM may use the demographic data provided to provide target specific ads to the user.  HUMTUM.COM will comply with the applicable law and share any personal and financial information law enforcement or other government/regulatory authorities ask for.

Operational Communications

 Special Offers and Updates  
We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, promotions, and other HUMTUM.COM offers.  You can sign up for these emails from us in Email Settings in the My Account section.  HUMTUM.COM gives the user the option not to receive these types of communications (See Choice and Opt-Out).

Newsletters  
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletters, if and when HUMTUM.COM begins this service, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  HUMTUM.COM gives the user the option not to receive these types of communications (see Opt-Out Provisions below) 

Service-related Announcements  
In the event that our services will be suspended for maintenance, HUMTUM.COM will send you strictly service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so.  Generally you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to delete your account.

Customer Service  
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcome email to activate your new account.  We will also communicate with you by email in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.  

Information Sharing and Disclosure

Except where you are expressly informed, we do not sell, rent, share, trade, or give away any of your personal information except to the financial institution that processes your credit card or check transactions unless required by law.  HUMTUM.COM will never share your personal information, without your express permission.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process involving HUMTUM.COM.

Opt-Out Provisions

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.  For example, if you purchase services but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference in Email Settings of the My Account section.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, if and when this service begins, and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by making changes to Email Settings of the My Account section.

You will be notified when any third party that is not our agent/service provider collects your personal information, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.

Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track user’s movements around the site and to gather broad demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.

Cookies

HUMTUM.COM uses cookies.  Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes.  We use cookies to deliver various services, such as storing your password, and to keep track of your personal preferences.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.  Some of our business partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies.

Links to Other Sites

HUMTUM.COM may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by HUMTUM.COM.  Please be aware that we, HUMTUM.COM, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies only to information collected by HUMTUM.COM

Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our services, you may correct, update or delete your profile/account by making appropriate changes in the My Profile and My Account sections of the site.  

Security

The security of your personal information is very important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact a HUMTUM.COM representative through the Customer Service section or through the Feedback/Comments link located in the footer of the website. 

Changes to this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
