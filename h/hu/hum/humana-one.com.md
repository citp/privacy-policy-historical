In fact, we share your concerns and will not solicit personal information from you as you tour our site, though you may provide that information voluntarily. If you do elect to provide personal information to us, in no case will we sell, license or transmit that information outside of Humana Inc. for any reason, unless you authorize us to do so. 

There are instances in which Humana Inc. might internally use the personal information you voluntarily submit. These instances include identifying and registering you for the Self-Service Center portion of our site. In addition, we may disclose your personal information (as described below) to our agents, third party partners, affiliates and subsidiaries to enable them to perform certain functions for us. We may also use your Secret Prompt, Secret Response and birth date to later identify you in case you forget or misplace your password. By learning a little about you, Humana Inc. can deliver more relevant content and product offerings, hence provide you better service.

Personally Identifiable Information is described as data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, social security number and date of birth (DOB). At times, we may request personal information from you through our sites in order to deliver requested materials to you, respond to your questions, or deliver a product or service. Members, physicians, employers and agents have the ability to register in a secured area of our Web site in order for us to deliver such products or services. Additional information collected by these sites may include organization names, addresses, group numbers and tax identification numbers. The purpose of the registration is to validate members, providers, employers and agents requesting access to our secured area. The registration also enables us to tailor the information sent to you. Contact forms are used only to deliver requested materials and respond to your questions.   
By providing an email address, you are indicating that publications can be sent to your email address. You are not required at any time to submit your email address for the purpose of receiving recurring informational/promotional emails from Humana Inc. and/or third parties. You may opt out of receiving publications via email by contacting the Customer Service toll-free number that appears on your member identification card or indicating your preference on our Web site. 

At the time of login to the Self Service area, you have the option to change your password and email address. In case you forget or misplace your Password, we will use your Secret Prompt and Secret Response to identify you in order to provide this information to you. Your personally identifiable information can be changed by contacting the Customer Service toll-free number that appears on your member identification card. 

We also collect information about you and your use of our site through the use of Cookies. "Cookies" are small computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive that grant you access to both secured and unsecured areas and are only used for session tracking.

**Internal Security Procedures**_  
Information that you share with us is kept strictly confidential and fully secure. Your encrypted (encoded) information is protected using "Secure Socket Layers (SSL)" as it passes between your browser and the Humana Inc. servers. Only authorized persons are permitted to access your personal information. All authorized persons must abide by security, privacy and confidentiality agreements.

  
_**Email**_  
Should you send us your questions, comments and job inquiry via email to any mail box provided on this Web site; we will share your correspondence with our Customer Service representatives and those employees or agents most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response. Ultimately, we will either discard your communication or, in some cases, archive it. Your email address will not be retained for secondary purposes. 

All information and correspondence you share with us will be handled in the strictest confidence. Please note that the email facilities on the unsecured areas of our Web Site (unlike those areas that require a sign-on and are password- protected) do not provide the same level of security. For that reason, please do not use unsecured email to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the Customer Service toll-free number that appears on your member identification card. Secured messaging facilities are available in the secured areas of our web site.
