# Privacy Policy - HUMAN EVENTS

HUMAN EVENTS ONLINE is committed to protecting the privacy of our registered members and subscribers. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. This policy is effective May 12, 2004.

 **What information do you capture if I subscribe online?**

If you place a subscription or order online, you must provide us contact information, including your name, mailing address and e-mail address; we also collect financial information, including credit card number and expiration date. 

**Will you rent, sell, or trade my e-mail address to a third party?**

Your e-mail address will be used by HUMAN EVENTS ONLINE to send order confirmations and to e-mail you about services and news that you have specifically chosen to receive. Though we hope you gain value from the messages you receive, you can choose to opt-out of receiving further messages by following the instructions provided at the close of each e-mail. We will honor the change to your account preferences on humanevents.com, however we also advertise on many other Internet and email outlets. Therefore you may see our advertisements in connection with other websites and email outlets. We will ensure that they offer you the ability to opt-out from their messages. 

We may from time to time send you special offers and advertisements for products or services offered by third parties. We will not disclose any of your personal information to such third parties when we do this. 

**Will you rent, sell, or trade my name and postal address to another company?**

Yes, HUMAN EVENTS ONLINE makes our members' names and addresses available to other mail order companies on a one-time use, rental-fee basis. We carefully choose who rents our names and only rent to companies offering goods or services that we think would be of interest to our members. If you would like us to remove your name and address from the rental file, please contact customer service and we will take your name off the list. You may e-mail us at [CustomerService@humaneventsonline.com](mailto:CustomerService@humaneventsonline.com). 

**Do you share any other personal information with third parties?**

No, we will never share your personal information with a third party. However, we do share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

 **Are my transactions secured online?**

Yes! This Web site takes every precaution to protect your information. You are the only one who can access your account so long as you keep your username and password secret. When you place an order or make a payment online, your credit card account information is verified and processed on a secure server outside of the site server and all transmissions are fully encrypted. The information you send us is also encrypted in transit using secure socket layer (SSL) software. 

**What are cookies? How do you use cookies?**

Cookies are small pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not hold any personal information, but they allow us to remember your password and store your site preferences.

If you check the "Remember me" box on the login page, we store your encrypted username and password to make it easier and faster to login the next time you return to the site. 

If you choose not to accept any cookies on the site, you will still be able to use all the features of the site. You will, however, need to provide your login information during each visit.

 **Do you track site usage and traffic patterns?**

Yes. By monitoring traffic patterns we learn which links and pages of the site are the most utilized. HUMAN EVENTS ONLINE will then use this information to further develop the features and functionality of the site and, hopefully, enhance your online membership experience. 

**How will I know if your privacy policy changes?**

If there are changes to our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
