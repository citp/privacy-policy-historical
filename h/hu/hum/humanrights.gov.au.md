# Privacy - Australian Human Rights Commission

## Privacy Policy 

The Australian Human Rights Commission seeks to adhere to the [Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government World Wide Websites](http://www.privacy.gov.au/materials/types/guidelines/view/6057) developed by the Australian Privacy Commissioner. 

This section explains the type of information that is collected by the Commission, how such information is used, under what circumstances and to whom it may be disclosed, and describes security measures in place on the website. 

### Information collected 

When you use this web site, our Internet Service Provider makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes:

  * the user's server address
  * the user's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc) 
  * the date and time of visit to the site
  * the pages accessed and documents downloaded
  * the previous site visited
  * the type of browser used. 



We will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message. It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list unless you request that this occur. We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it, without your consent.

The Internet is an insecure medium however, and users should be aware that there are inherent risks in transmitting information across the Internet. Information submitted unencrypted via email may be at risk of being intercepted, read or modified. If you do not want your message sent by email you can [post it to the Commission](https://web.archive.org/web/20130410162543id_/http%3A//humanrights.gov.au/about/contacts/index.html). 

### Access to information collected 

No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency or other government agency may exercise its legal authority to inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs. 

### Links to other sites 

This site contains links to other sites. The Australian Human Rights Commission is not responsible for the content and the privacy practices of other websites and encourages you to examine each site's privacy policy and make your own decisions regarding the accuracy, reliability, and correctness of material and information found. 

### Cookies 

A 'cookie' is a small piece of information that is placed on the user's hard drive while navigating a website. Cookies are used on this website for the internal function of our site navigation scripts, events calendar scripts and browser size determination. They have no function beyond those elements.

The cookies do not send any identifying information about the user to the Commission.
