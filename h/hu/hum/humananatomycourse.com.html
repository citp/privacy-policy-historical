sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party</b>. 
Period.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How 
we gather information from users</b><br>How we collect and store information depends 
on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate 
and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain 
features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information 
when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, 
and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, our company also 
collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that 
may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet 
Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information 
from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, 
sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may 
control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting 
our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through 
other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, 
for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do 
you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter 
your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s 
features according to your preferences.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What 
we do with the information we collect</b><br>Like other Web publishers, we collect 
information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and

many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with 
similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services 
(e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). 
Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business 
partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable 
Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We

sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, 
user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your

reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts 
you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate 
or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure 
in such cases.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Affiliated
