# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: October 18, 2016 

Humble Bundle, Inc. ("Humble Bundle," "we," "us," or "our") has created the following Privacy Policy to let users of [humblebundle.com](https://web.archive.org/) or Humble Bundle’s mobile application (individually and collectively, the “Service”), know what information we collect when you visit the Service, why we collect it, and how it is used. This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of the Service; it does not apply to other online or offline Humble Bundle sites, products or services. The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to users of our Service. By using the Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy and agree to our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms). 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy.**

We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. If a material change is made to this Privacy Policy, then Humble Bundle will post a notice on [humblebundle.com](https://web.archive.org/). Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates. 

**Privacy Shield.**

Humble Bundle has applied to participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland. Humble Bundle has certified or will certify to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement and liability. For purposes of this section, Humble Bundle refers to the following U.S. legal entities: Humble Bundle, Inc. 

In accordance with our obligations under the Privacy Shield, and subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, we hereby affirm our commitment to subject to the Privacy Shield Principles all personal information transferred from the European Union, European Economic Area or Switzerland in reliance on the Privacy Shield. This means that, in addition to our other obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles, we shall be liable to you for any third party agent to which we transfer your personal information and that processes such personal information in a manner that violates the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the resulting damages. 

For inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with Privacy Shield, please send us an email or letter at the Privacy Shield address specified in the "Contacting Humble Bundle" section below. If we are unable to resolve your complaint directly, you may submit your complaint at no cost to you to JAMS at <https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim>. In the event there are residual complaints that have not been resolved by JAMS, or any other means, you may seek a non-monetary remedy through binding arbitration to be provided to you in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles. 

To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, please visit [http://www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/). A list of companies certified under the Privacy Shield Framework is available at the following link: <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>. 

**What Information Is Collected?**

**Information You Provide.**

We may collect information you provide directly via the Service. For example, we collect information when you register an account, sign-up for a monthly subscription, choose how much to pay and where your money goes, make a purchase, or otherwise communicate or transact with us through the Service. 

The information we collect includes Personal Information. "Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number, payment information (credit card and address), or other contact information, whether at work or at home. You may choose to voluntarily submit certain other information to us through the Service, including Personal Information, but you are solely responsible for your own Personal Information in instances where we have not requested that you submit such information to us. 

We may de-identify your Personal Information by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. Personal Information once de-identified is not subject to this Privacy Policy and we may treat it as non-Personal Information and use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law. 

**Information Collected Automatically.**

Humble Bundle also automatically collects certain information about you when you access or use the Service ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, data regarding network connected hardware, and information about your use of the Service. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Humble Bundle does not consider Usage Information to be Personal Information. However, Usage Information may be combined with your Personal Information. To the extent that we combine Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. 

The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include: 

  * Log Information: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, which is stored in log files. 
  * Information Collected by Tracking Technologies: Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, device fingerprinting, in-app tracking methods, and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed may be used to collect information about your interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and activity behavior. 
    * Cookies.   
When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your device that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Humble Bundle help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. A cookie may also convey information about how you browse the Service to us. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 
    * Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels").   
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views. 
    * Embedded Scripts.   
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted or deactivated thereafter. 
    * Location-identifying Technologies.   
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location. 
    * Device Fingerprinting.   
Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device's browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a "fingerprint" of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications. 
    * In-App Tracking Methods.   
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps. You can stop all collection of information via our mobile applications by uninstalling them. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. 



For further information on tracking technologies and your choices regarding them, please see the "Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies" section below. 

**Information from Other Sources.**

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including service providers and third party billing processors such as Amazon and PayPal, and combine such information with information we have collected about you. To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with Personal Information we have collected about you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by third parties or third party policies or practices. 

**How Is Such Information Used?**

We use information about you, including your Personal Information, for any purposes consistent with our statements under this Privacy Policy including to: 

  * Provide you the services offered on our Service. 
  * Manage your registration, account, monthly subscription and purchases. 
  * Contact you if you request customer or technical support, and provide you with customer service. 
  * Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, information regarding changes to our policies, and support and administrative messages. 
  * Prevent and address fraud, breach of policies or terms, and threats or harm. 
  * Coordinate your payments and where your money goes.

  * Fulfill any other purpose disclosed at the time you provide Personal Information. 



We may make any commercial use of de-identified information, including sharing the information with third parties. 

**How Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?**

Our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers may receive, or be given access to your information, including Personal Information and Usage Information, in connection with their work on our behalf. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance, although we may permit them to use aggregate information which does not identify you or de-identified information for other purposes. 

We must disclose Personal Information about you in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also share information about you with third parties for any purposes consistent with our statements under this Privacy Policy, including as follows: 

  * To complete and support your purchases on the Service. For example, we may disclose information to third party payment processors and the charities you select. 
  * To third party social networks at your direction, e.g. when you "tweet" or "like" something on the Service. 
  * If required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Humble Bundle or the Service; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Humble Bundle; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Humble Bundle, its web sites or the public. 
  * If Humble Bundle or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Humble Bundle goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Humble Bundle may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. 
  * With our affiliates for internal business purposes; 
  * With our affiliates, business partners, and other third parties for their own business purposes, including direct marketing purposes (California residents have certain rights set forth in "Your California Privacy Rights" below). 
  * For purposes disclosed at the time you provide Personal Information. 
  * With your consent or at your direction. 



In addition, from time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events. 

**Social Features and Links to Other Web Sites.**

Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain third party services, such as third party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social Features include "liking" or "sharing" our content and otherwise connecting our Service to a third party service. If you use Social Features, and potentially other third party services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on our Service or by the third party service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third party service that references our Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Humble Bundle in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with our Service. Also, both Humble Bundle and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Service and the third party service. 

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. 

**Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.**

Our Service uses Google Analytics and other service providers to help us learn about who visits our Service and what pages are being viewed. These analytics services may use tracking technologies. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these service providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these service providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service's activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other internet usage. 

We may also engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on third party services. These third parties may use tracking technologies to tailor ads to your interests based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising, which may include sending you an ad on a third party service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). 

You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. 

You may choose whether to receive interest-based advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>, and <http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices> for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Humble Bundle is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. 

Our Service uses fraud prevention software developed by Sift Science, Inc. Sift Science’s anti-fraud services are designed to prevent your credit card and other Personal Information from being used in a fraudulent purchase through the Service. Sift Science works by analyzing user behavior and detecting patterns that indicate fraud. Sift Science may also track your activity over time and over a network of sites. We encourage you to learn more about Sift Science and read their privacy policy on their website at [https://siftscience.com](https://siftscience.com/). 

**“Do Not Track”**

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to "Do Not Track" signals or other mechanisms. For more information on "Do Not Track," visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).
