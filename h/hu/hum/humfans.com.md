#### 4\. SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION

4.1. Lahmun take steps to protect your information from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure and against misuse, interference, loss, destruction and damage.

Although Lahmun will take reasonable steps to protect your information and make sure it is safe and secure and Lahmun use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information, Lahmun cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk.
