# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: April 25, 2014 

Your privacy is important, so Humble Bundle, Inc. ("Humble Bundle," "we," "us," or "our") has created the following Privacy Policy to let users of [humblebundle.com](https://web.archive.org/) or Humble Bundle’s mobile application (individually and collectively, the “Service”), know what information we collect when you visit the Service, why we collect it, and how it is used. This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of the Service; it does not apply to other online or offline Humble Bundle sites, products or services. The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the customer/purchaser utilizing our Service. This Privacy Policy is governed by our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms). By using the Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. If a material change is made to this Privacy Policy, then Humble Bundle will post a notice on [humblebundle.com](https://web.archive.org/). Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms). 

**What Information Is Collected?**

" **Personal Information** " means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Humble Bundle collects the following Personally Identifiable Information from you when you use our Service: your email address, and payment information (credit card and address, PayPal, or Amazon information). If you correspond with us by email or through the Service, we may retain the content of your messages, your email address and our responses. 

Humble Bundle also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. : Our Service uses Google Analytics to help us learn about who visits our site and what pages are being viewed. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of our features. 

When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Humble Bundle help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. A cookie may also convey information about how you browse the Service to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 

**How Is Such Information Used?**

We use your PersonalInformation to provide you the services offered on our Service. Humble Bundle may use your email address to email you a link to your download page and to notify you of future Humble Bundle promotions if the "Notify me about future Humble Bundle promotions" checkbox is checked. Humble Bundle may also use your Personal Information in order to contact you if you request customer or technical support. 

Humble Bundle uses the data you enter on the Service, such as the price you enter and your slider positions, to make sure that your contributions go to the right places. Humble Bundle uses browser data like which operating system you are using to improve the Service’s user experience by making your download page default to the game builds corresponding to your current operating system. 

We use cookies to improve our Service and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. Cookies from our Service cannot be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change your browser settings to refuse them. 

We may use certain information about you internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content. 

We may make your Personal Information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your Personal Information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your Personal Information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect on the Site (the “Analytical Data”). We may make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties. 

**Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?**

Humble Bundle does not sell or share the information it collects through the Service except as described in this Privacy Policy. Information collected from you is disclosed and used to complete and support your purchases from and use of the Humble Bundle Service and to comply with any requirements of law. For example, we may disclose information to third party payment processors. We may also disclose information to third party social networks at your direction, e.g. when you "tweet" or "like" something on the Service. 

From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events. 

Humble Bundle may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Humble Bundle or the Service; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Humble Bundle; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Humble Bundle, its web sites or the public. If Humble Bundle or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Humble Bundle goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Humble Bundle may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. 

**Choice.**

You can access and modify your information by visiting your unique download page and changing the settings. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and the choices you make on the Service will not necessarily apply to Personal Information you may have provided to Humble Bundle in the context of other, separately operated, Humble Bundle products or services. 

**“Do Not Track”**

In compliance with California legislation, AB370, effective January 1, 2014, Humble Bundle’s practices in responding to “do not track” signals and collecting user information over time and across a network of websites when you visit the Site are described below. 

Our Site uses fraud prevention software developed by Sift Science, Inc. Sift Science’s anti-fraud services are designed to prevent your credit card and other Personal Information from being used in a fraudulent purchase through the Service. Sift Science works by analyzing user behavior and detecting patterns that indicate fraud. If the Service does not track user behavior, then Sift Science will not work. Thus, in an effort to protect you against credit card fraud, the Service does not honor “do not track” signals sent by your browser when you use the Service. Sift Science may also track your activity over time and over a network of sites. We encourage you to learn more about Sift Science and read their privacy policy on their website at [https://siftscience.com](https://siftscience.com/). 

**The Security of Your Information.**

The Personal Information that you provide to us is stored on severs that are located in secured facilities and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, Humble Bundle employees and agents who have access to your personal information are trained in the maintenance and security of that information. However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of the Service and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems. 

**International Transfers**

Personal information collected on the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Humble Bundle or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

**Children.**

Humble Bundle will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any person age 13 and under. Humble Bundle encourages parents to instruct their children to never give out personal information when online. Parents who are concerned about the transfer of personal information from their children may contact us at contact@humblebundle.com to obtain a record of any information held by Humble Bundle and have it removed at their request. 

**Links to Other Web Sites.**

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. 

**Your Consent To This Privacy Policy.**

By using this Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our [**Terms and Conditions**](https://web.archive.org/terms) take precedence over any conflicting Privacy Policy provision. We may change this Privacy Policy by posting a new version of this Privacy Policy on this Service which it is your responsibility to review. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates. 

**Contacting Humble Bundle.**

**Governing Law**

This Privacy Policy is governed by, and construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions. 

**Dispute Resolution Outside The European Union**

If you are a resident of any country not a current member of the European Union, you agree that should any dispute or claim arise out of, or relate to, this Policy (“Claim”), you will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the Claim directly with us. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for thirty (30) days after one party has provided written notice of the Claim to the other party, all parties shall join in mediation services in San Francisco, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them. 

Humble Bundle will send its notice to the mailing or email address that we have on file. You will send your notice to Humble Bundle, 201 Post St., Floor 11, San Francisco, CA 94108, Attn: Legal Department. Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim. 

**Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union**

If you are a resident of the European Union, in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you may report your claim to the European Union Data Protection Authorities located in your jurisdiction. 

**European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection - Safe Harbor**

Humble Bundle complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Humble Bundle has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.
