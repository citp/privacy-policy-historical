However, please note that if an advertiser asks Humor Planet&nbsp;to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Humor Planet&nbsp;Website, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
