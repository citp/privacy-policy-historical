We may also need to collect additional information from medical practitioners or from your employer for the purposes of assessing your eligibility for the insurance cover you have applied for or the assessment of a claim. We will always seek your express consent before collecting this kind of sensitive information. 

We are also required to ask for certain information by law. Wherever there is a legal requirement for us to ask for information about you, we will inform you of the obligation and the consequences of not giving us the requested information. For example, we are required to ask for your Tax File Number when you become a member of HOST **PLUS**.

You have a right to ask us to correct any information we hold about you if you believe it is not accurate, complete or up to date. If we do not agree with the corrections you have supplied, we are not required to alter the information.
