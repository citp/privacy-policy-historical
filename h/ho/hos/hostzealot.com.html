<h3>Does HostZealot Share the Information that is Collected?</h3>
<p>In order to provide you with content and services that match your interests, HostZealot may have relationships with services and other companies on the Internet. These also may require registration to make them function properly. You can recognize most of these sites by the joint branding of HostZealot and such companies. As well, if you see a logo on the page that says 'Powered by third party"', you are on a co-branded site. Other third-party relationships are "private label" relationships where another entity provides HostZealot with technology, services and/or content under HostZealot branding. These sites form part of HostZealot if pages at the site display HostZealot branding bar and a link to the Terms and Conditions or to this Privacy Policy. If you provide, or if HostZealot collects, personal information on a co-branded or private label site that forms part of HostZealot, that data may be shared with the partners for the purpose of providing the products and services available at the site.</p>
<p>In addition to finding co-branded sites that form part of HostZealot, you will find direct links on HostZealot to sites offered by third parties that are not part of HostZealot. Some of these sites are authorized to use HostZealot brands and/or logos. In some cases the operators of such sites may disclose personal information collected by them to HostZealot. Such information will be used by HostZealot solely in connection with the products and services of such third party. This Privacy Policy does not, however, apply to the privacy practices of such sites</p>
<p>HostZealot may disclose personal information to its agents, suppliers and service providers in conjunction with providing you with Products and Services or operating portions of HostZealot. Such entities will be required to use personal information provided solely for such purposes. In addition, HostZealot may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services.</p>
<p>HostZealot does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. HostZealot may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not disclosed to the third party.</p>

In addition, all such email materials have easy-to-follow unsubscribe directions posted at the bottom of the email. If you have any questions or concerns, please <a href="mailto:4abuse@HostZealot.net">contact us</a>.</p>
