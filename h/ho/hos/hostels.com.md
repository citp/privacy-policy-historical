# Hostels.com | Privacy Policy & Security Statement

_Hostels.com has been processing online hostel reservations since 2003 and we have always placed the security of our internet transactions and our customers credit card details as our top priority._

We will continue to offer our customers the highest level of security available for online transactions and hope this reassures you when you make your reservations with us.

All sensitive information exchanged between your computer and our site is encrypted using SSL. Our SSL Certificate is provided by GlobalSign. This ensures that your information is transmitted securely and is safe from third parties. Please read on for more information on site encryption.

**SITE ENCRYPTION**

Hostels.com utilizes a technology called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). SSL is a set of rules followed by computers connected to the Internet.  
Encryption - These rules include encryption, which guards against eavesdropping   
Data Integrity - Data integrity, which ensures that your communications are not tampered with during transmission and   
Authentication - authentication, which verifies that the party who receives your communication are who they claim to be.

**HOW ENCRYPTION WORKS**

There are two levels of encryption: 40-bit and 128-bit. With 40-bit encryption, there are billions of possible keys to decipher the coded information, and only one of them works. Someone intercepting the information would have to find the right key - a nearly impossible task. With 128-bit encryption, there are 300 billion trillion times as many keys as with 40-bit encryption. It is virtually impossible for an unauthorized party to find the right key, even if they are equipped with the best computers.

If you're about to send information to a site that's not using SSL, your browser will warn you first. SSL protects your communications during transmission. Because of the authentication involved, secure servers are slower than the regular server for delivering files. Therefore SSL is only used when transmitting sensitive information across the web.

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Hostels.com realises some people are unsure about entering their personal details into websites over the Internet. Below, we explain how we use your information and how we protect your privacy. Hostels.com and its associated companies respect and protect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with this website. Any information which is provided by you to Hostels.com via this website or otherwise will be treated in accordance with the terms of the Irish Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 and/or such amending or replacement legislation as may be adopted in Ireland from time to time.

**INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROCESS YOUR BOOKING**

For us to process a booking for you on behalf of a travel services provider, we require some information from you. This includes your name, nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number and email address. Also, since we confirm your booking while you are on the site, we require your credit or debit card details so we can guarantee your beds when you pay your deposit.

**WHO SEES YOUR INFORMATION**

We are required to send your information to the travel services provider with which you booked travel services so that the travel service provider knows who you are and when you will use its travel services. We give your name, your nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number, your email address, your credit card details and of course, the details of your booking. The travel service provider requires this information to accept a confirmed booking from you. All travel service providers on whose behalf we facilitate bookings have agreed to the Hostels.com terms and conditions and accept this privacy policy.

**SECURITY**

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

In addition to the use and disclosure of information which is required when you avail of our travel related and data processing services (and which we describe above), we use your email address for sending you a confirmation of your bookings, pre-trip reminder e-mails, an email reminder to provide a guest review of your last accommodation stay, or occasionally to inform you of new features on Hostels.com. Our booking confirmation and pre-trip reminder emails may contain banner advertising. We only use your phone number to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your booking. In circumstances where you contact us with a query, we use your contact details in order to respond to your query.

**TARGETED ADVERTISING**

We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of the travel related opportunities which we feature on our website. We work with our advertising partners in order to try and ensure that when you see a Hostelworld advert it will be relevant to you and your interests. This applies to adverts that are displayed on Hostelworld’s own websites, in Hostelworld emails, and on websites owned by third parties. We do this by allowing our third party advertisers to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our website, such as the pages you visit on our website and the locations you appear to be interested in. We also provide third party advertisers with non-personally identifiable information that we collect about you when you use our website in order to only show you relevant adverts. We may also use such information in order to avoid showing you adverts on third party websites like Facebook and Twitter if we don’t think you will be interested in them.

When we share your information with third party advertisers we always ensure that we do so in compliance with our obligations under data protection law. We may use technologies such as “hashing” to ensure that we do not provide our third party service providers with your personal data. For more information on how our third party advertising service providers gather information about your use of this website, please refer to our cookies policy which is available [here](https://web.archive.org/d/cookies-policy).
