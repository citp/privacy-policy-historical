Some of the information we collect (such as about health or religion) will only be collected on the condition that we have your positive consent to its use. We will seek this consent when necessary. 

WHAT WILL WE DO WITH IT?

  1. For the purpose of providing you with our services, we may disclose the information to the providers of the services making up your holiday arrangements (who could be located outside the UK/EEA). 
  2. In order for you to travel overseas, it may be mandatory (as requested government authorities) to disclose your information for immigration, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or any other purposes which they determine appropriate. Even if not mandatory, we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate. 
  3. We may need to disclose our customer list including any personal information relating to you to a third party who acquires or attempts to acquire all or substantially all of the asset/ stock in our company or our website. 
  4. We may also disclose information to organisations who act as “data processors” on our behalf, or to other organisations who perform business functions on our behalf, some of whom are outside the UK/EEA. These functions include administration, providing services (and contacting you where necessary), customer care, business management and operation, re-organisation/structuring/sale of our business (or our group companies), risk assessment, security and crime prevention/detection, research and analysis, marketing, monitoring, measuring and assessing customer purchasing preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection. 
  5. We may from time to time contact you (by email and by post) with information about special offers, brochures, new products, forthcoming events or competitions. If do not wish to receive such information, you may ask us in writing not to receive it. If you set up an account via our website, you will be able to tell us how you would like to receive such information when we send it by email (by unsubscribing to our email alerts) 
  6. If you set up an account via our website, we will store your personal information and information about the bookings that you have made with us that have been performed and those that are due to be performed in the future.
