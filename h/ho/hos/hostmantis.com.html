  <h3>HostMantis Privacy Policy</h3>
<p><b>What types of data does HostMantis.com collect?</b><br>
On the HostMantis.com network, we collect non-personally identifiable information 
(non-PII) such as web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction 
with advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and 
browsing behavior. Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information 
including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p><br>
<p><b>How does HostMantis.com track consumer behavior?</b><br>
Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer that allow sites to 
recognize the computer when you revisit the site. Generally, sites use this 
cookie to provide services such as auto login, information delivery, and to 
better understand how you are interacting with the site. These cookies enable 
sites to customize the site to your needs and interests, so that they can be as 
valuable and relevant to you as possible.</p><br> 
<p>Like many websites, HostMantis.com sets a cookie on your computer containing an 
anonymous identifier. This cookie allows HostMantis.com to better target and analyze 
consumer behavior with the goal of providing better and more relevant 
advertising.</p><br>
<p>You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to 
use certain features on the websites or take full advantage of all the website 
offerings and targeted advertising. You can configure your browser to accept all 
cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. 
Note: HostMantis.com employs Flash cookies, which are not deleted via the normal 
browser tools. Please visit Adobe in order to manage Flash cookies. 
Alternatively, you may click here to opt-out of data collection and targeting 
cookies from HostMantis.com. Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or 
change Web browsers or delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform 
this process again.</p><br>
<p><b>How does HostMantis.com use this information?</b><br>
HostMantis.com has created a technology that uses any consumer information to create 
anonymous consumer segments. For example, consumers that demonstrate car buying 
behaviors are grouped into an auto-buyer segment. These segments will be used to 
target and optimize advertiser campaigns. HostMantis.com will never use this 
information to identify, locate or contact consumers.</p><br>
<p><b>Which data do we retain and for how long?</b><br>
We maintain non-PII information on consumer behavior for 90 days. This data 
includes web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with 
advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and 
browsing behavior. Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information 
including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p><br>
<p><b>What if I have questions about how my or other consumers’ data is being used?</b><br>
We are more than happy to respond to any customer inquires about privacy 
concerns. Please contact us at privacy@HostMantis.com or the address below with 
any questions of complaints.</p><br>

<p>For more information, please see the Network Advertising Initiative web site.
What if I don’t want to be tracked - HostMantis.com Opt-out
You can opt out of the targeted advertising delivered by HostMantis.com by 
requesting an "opt-out" cookie (a blank cookie) by HostMantis.com, which will 
prevent information from being uniquely associated with your browser. This 
allows you to opt-out of the HostMantis.com tracking system without erasing other 
cookies associated with
your browser.</p><br>
<p>This opt-out means that HostMantis.com will not store information unique to your 
browser behavior and will be unable to recognize your browser from one visit to 
the next. Opting-out does not mean you will not receive online advertising. 
However, because the network is not able to uniquely identify your browser, 
HostMantis.com is unable to deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage 
patterns. 
Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or 
delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform this process again.
To opt out of all NAI member networks' behavioral tracking, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">the NAI 
opt-out page.</a></p><br>

  <h3>Testimonial</h3>
<br>
  <q>I moved from my old host because their servers were becoming very slow. Started the whole search for the best hosting for a little price thing. Ran across HostMantis - found that they had their servers in the Planets network and I used to work with some companies that hosted their servers at the planet, so I knew that their internet connection to the internet was fast. Tested out my first domain and it was rock solid. I don't typically recommend things but from snail crawling to Lightning fast I had to tell someone. 

Also - every time I've had to contact them they have responded immediately without delay. 

Thanks HostMantis and look forward to continued Up time!</q> <br><strong>Scott S.</strong> <br><a href="http://www.tutsrus.com" target="_blank">www.tutsrus.com</a><br>
