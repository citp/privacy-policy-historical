    Hostelworld.com realise some people are unsure about entering their personal details into web sites over the internet.  Below, we explain how we use your information and how we protect your privacy.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROCESS YOUR BOOKING<br></b>
    For us to process a booking for you, we require some information from you.  This includes your name, nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number and email address.    Also, since we confirm your booking while you are on the site, we require your credit or debit card details so we can guarantee your beds when you pay your deposit.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>WHO SEES YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>    
    We are required to send your information to the hostel in which you booked so that they know who you are and when they are to expect you.  We give your name, your nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number, your email address, your credit card details and of course, the details of your booking.  They require this information to accept a confirmed booking from you.  All hostels we book beds for have agreed to the Hostelworld.com terms and conditions and accept this privacy policy.
   </p>

    <b>SECURITY</b><br>
    All information we collect from you is gathered when you are on our secure server.  The secure server, which is signed by Verisign, means that information is transferred securely between your computer and the Hostelworld.com server and that no third parties can intercept and read and use the data.  The padlock symbol on your browser indicates you are on a secure server.
   </p>
   <p>
    We send information to the server in the same way, again ensuring that no third parties can intercept and see your information.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
    We only use your email address for sending you a confirmation of your bookings or to contact you for any reason directly linked to your reservation, or occasionally to inform you of new features on HostelWorld.com.  We only use your phone number to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your booking.
   </p>
   <p>
    We <b>never</b> give or sell your personal details to any third parties, other than to the hostel in which you booked, or if we are legally required to do so.  On occasions, we may supply statistics about our customers to third-parties such as hostels or other agents.  These statistics never contain personally identifying information.
