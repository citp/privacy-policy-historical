									<dt>How do we use this information?</dt>
									<dd><p>The basic information we do collect is used to help us analyze where our visitors come from and which pages on our site are accessed the most.  Cookies may be used to facilitate your customer interaction with us.  For example, if you log in to a password protected page on our site, a cookie may be set on your computer so you will not have to enter your password the next time you visit.
