# Privacy Policy | HostingCon

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Your privacy is extremely important to us.

To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To ensure this notice is easy to find, it is available on every page on the HostingCon website.

**THE WAY WE USE INFORMATION**

We use the information you provide when placing an order or making a request only in the context of your involvement with HostingCon. We use the information to the extent necessary to complete an order/request you placed. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share the information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or as described below.

**Contact Information Use**

We use your e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail you send us and for future contact with you regarding upcoming conferences, events and services. Such addresses are not shared with outside parties without your permission. All emails regarding conferences, events, services and sponsor information will be sent directly from iNET Interactive Sponsor-related emails will be sent by iNET Interactive on behalf of the sponsor.

By logging into the [Account Management](http://www.hostingcon.com/account) page you have the ability to change your email preferences, including which types of conference-related emails you wish to receive.

As a service to exhibitors, partners and sponsors, we make HostingCon attendee/guests mailing addresses available to these companies for pre-and post-show promotion for limited use. Telephone numbers may also be made available for pre-show promotion. If you would like your name, mailing address, telephone number and fax number removed from these promotional opportunities, please e-mail [support@hostingcon.com](mailto:support@hostingcon.com). You may also contact HostingCon Customer Service by phone at (513) 322-5600 [Within USA] (877) 463-8468 [Within USA] or +1 (513) 322-5600 [International].

Attendees/guests at HostingCon may voluntarily allow exhibitors to scan their badge. This voluntary action allows the exhibitor to electronically capture the following information about attendee/guest: Name, company name, title, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address. This scan is equivalent to the attendee/guest presenting the exhibitor with a business card. Use of the attendee’s information gathered through these means by the exhibitor would fall under the exhibitor’s privacy policy.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer and is tied to information about the user. (Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personal information while on our site.) We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. HostingCon uses cookies to gather information about your visits and to help customize your experience while on our website. If cookies are disabled on your browser, you will still be able to access our website.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose any information that could be used to identify those individuals.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

If you have a HostingCon account (attendees, speakers and exhibitors of HostingCon 2006 or later will have an account), you can access and amend your information online in the [Account Management](http://www.hostingcon.com/account) page. You also may contact HostingCon Customer Service by phone at (513) 322-5600 [Within USA] (877) 463-8468 [Within USA] or +1 (513) 322-5600 [International].

You may correct factual errors in your personal information by sending us a request that illustrates the error.

To protect your privacy and security, we also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
