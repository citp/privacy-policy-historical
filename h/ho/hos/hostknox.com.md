By submitting your testimonial, you explicitly agree and give your consent to have the information it contains (Name, Website, Testimonial) published on our website. We will show this information only on our Testimonials page and will use it only to show your level of satisfaction with our services. Your information will not be provided to third parties and will not be used in any marketing campaigns.

### Other

We may request and collect any additional information from you for other purposes such as to assist you with any website-related issues. For example, if you submit a support ticket and request assistance with your website, we may request that you provide us with the login credentials for its administrative area, so that we can investigate the problem and do our best to help you resolve it.

## Information we share

We will not provide your personal information to untrusted third parties and will keep all your information confidential. More information about the cases when we may provide your personal information to third parties is available below:

  * In order to process payments and deliver the services you request from us, we have to provide the necessary details to the third parties we work with. These third parties are our payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), our domain registrar (TuCows), our SSL vendor (AlphaSSL). These are trusted business affiliates who work together with us and are subject to strict terms and conditions regarding how they process personal data.
  * If required by law, we will share information with law enforcement agencies in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities.



Neither we at HostKnox.com, nor any of our trusted partners will sell or provide personal data to untrusted/unaffiliated third parties. The data that we and our trusted partners collect and process is used only to deliver the services you request.

## Data storage and retention

We process and keep account and order data in a secure environment with strictly controlled access. The information is kept for as long as the account and its corresponding services remain active. For accounting/billing and archiving purposes, we may keep data for inactive accounts for at least five years after their deactivation.

We do not store credit card information on our servers. The necessary payment transaction information goes through a payment processor (PayPal or Stripe) which processes the payment on our behalf.

We will keep a record of any correspondence you have with us (via email, contact form, support tickets). This data is kept indefinitely.

## Consent

By using our website and the services we provide, you consent to the rules and agreements defined in this privacy policy and in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms).

## WHOIS information

Upon domain registration, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires that certain personal information be transferred to WHOIS (domain registration information) and made public. We cannot control how the WHOIS information is used by the public. The recommended legal way to make the WHOIS information private is by applying privacy protection to your domain.
