					<h1>Privacy and Confidentiality</h1>
					<div>
					  <p>HostUpon Inc., is referred to in this Privacy Policy document as ("<strong>HostUpon</strong>"). This Privacy Policy covers the website <a href="https://hostupon.com">https://hostupon.com</a> and <a href="https://hostupon.ca">https://hostupon.ca</a>.</p>
					  <p>HostUpon does not collect personally identifiable information (any   information by which you can be identified) when you visit our website,   unless as specifically outlined in this Privacy Policy or if you choose to   provide that information to HostUpon. The HostUpon Privacy Policy is integrated into, and   made a part of the Terms of Service ("TOS") Agreement found here <a href="https://hostupon.com/terms.php" title="Terms of Service">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
					  <h4>Information and Data We Collect</h4>
					  <p>Customers are asked to provide certain personal   information when they sign up for HostUpon services, including their name,   street address, city, state/province, country, email address, telephone number, and billing information (such   as a credit card number).  In addition, to register a domain name,   customers are asked to provide this information for the registrant,   administrative contact, technical contact and billing contact of the   domain name for submission to the appropriate domain registry or   registration database. This is also known as the WHOIS database.</p>
					  <p>HostUpon makes use of technologies   like cookies in order to keep track of visitors and registered customers   and to relate one computer transaction to a later one.  You may set   your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or change the   settings on your web browser to clear or disable cookies.  If you decide   to disable cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all   of the features of HostUpon's website.  Please be aware that if you   visit third party websites where you are prompted to log in or that are   customizable, you may be required to accept cookies.  Cookies do not   enable third parties to access any of your personally identifiable   information.  However, advertisers and partners may also use their own   cookies.  HostUpon does not control use of these cookies and is not   responsible for information collected through them.

					  <h4>Use Of Information</h4>
					  <p><strong>HostUpon does NOT in any way trade, rent or sell your   personal information or data to any other organization or third party,   except as provided specifically in this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
					  <p>HostUpon has designed its websites so that   individuals may visit us on the Web without revealing personally   identifiable information.  HostUpon uses information it collects to   provide and collect payment for its web hosting solutions and other   related services.  Passively collected information, such as information   collected from or about your device including through the placement or   reading of cookies or other tracking technologies is used to provide a   customized experience as you use HostUpon services.</p>
					  <p><strong>A) Customer Contact and Account Information</strong></p>
					  <p>The information collected from customers is used to   manage each customer’s account (e.g., billing details and client area management)   and to promote other products or services that HostUpon believe may be   of interest to its customers.  HostUpon may also generate   non-identifying and aggregate profiles from information that customers   provide during registration.  HostUpon may use this aggregated and   non-identifying information to promote advertisements that appear on   HostUpon's website and in connection with its services.  All such   aggregated and non-identifying information that HostUpon collects, as   well as any analysis of such information that HostUpon produces, is   proprietary information of HostUpon.</p>
					  <p><strong>B) Analytics and Statistics</strong></p>
					  <p>HostUpon uses information gathered from its website   analytics (e.g., user IP addresses) to help diagnose problems with   HostUpon’ servers, and to administer and optimize the HostUpon website.    HostUpon may also collects broad demographic information from this data   to help improve its website and services collectively.  Any statistics gathered by   HostUpon are proprietary property of HostUpon.</p>
					  <p><strong>C) Support and Email Communication</strong></p>
					  <p>When customers send email inquiries and/or support ticket  requests to HostUpon, the return email address (and other personal   information provided in the inquiry/request) is used to answer the email   inquiry/request received.					  </p>
					  <p><strong>D) Confidentiality</strong></p>
					  <p>With the exception of trusted business partners who   work with or on behalf of HostUpon, and are subject to specific   confidentiality agreements, HostUpon will not provide or sell to any   third party your personal information and will keep all customer   information confidential, subject to the following: </p>
					  <ol type="a">
					    <li> HostUpon does not share personally   identifiable information about individual users with advertisers.    HostUpon may display online advertisements and share aggregated and   non-identifying information about customers collected through the   registration process or through promotions with   certain advertisers.  This aggregated and non-identifying information   may be used to deliver tailored advertisements across the Web or on the HostUpon website.<br>
					      <br>
				        </li>
					    <li> HostUpon may access, preserve and share   customer information with companies, organizations, governmental   entities, or individuals outside of HostUpon if we believe, in good   faith and in our sole discretion, that the law requires us to do so.    This may include, but is not limited to, responding to subpoenas, court   orders or other legal processes.  HostUpon may access, preserve, and   share customer information as necessary to: establish or exercise   HostUpon’ legal rights or defend against any claim including   threatened claims; investigate, prevent, or take action regarding   suspected fraud or other illegal activities; prevent death or serious   physical harm to any person; or investigate violations of HostUpon’ <a href="https://hostupon.com/terms.php">Terms of Service</a>.<br>
					      <br>
				        </li>
					    <li> In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the   rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers   (“ICANN”) or certain registries, domain name registration information   has to be made available and accessible to the public through a “WHOIS”   search.  The WHOIS is a publicly accessible database that lists the   domain name registration information for a particular domain name, the   name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name’s   creation and expiration date.  HostUpon may deposit your domain   registration information with a third-party escrow provider to comply   with ICANN requirements.  At times, customers may receive solicitations   that result from searches of the publicly available databases by other   companies or individuals.  Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come   from HostUpon and HostUpon does not control the use of WHOIS   information by third parties.<br>
					      <br>
				        </li>
				      </ol>
					  <h4>Data Security Measures</h4>
					  <p>HostUpon uses multiple security measures to prevent   the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.   Your data is protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption   technology, the industry standard. This encrypts order data and is   designed to aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of that customer   information.  In the unlikely event of a data breach, HostUpon will   notify the appropriate regulatory and/or legal authorities, as well as   affected customers/individuals, within seventy-two (72) hours.</p>
					  <h4>Customer Options</h4>
					  <ul>
					    <li><strong>Public Forums</strong><br>
					      <br>
					      <p>Be advised that   any information you may disclose or post in forums or other public areas   of the HostUpon website or the Internet, becomes public information.    You should always exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal   information in these public areas.  To request removal of your personal   information from HostUpon testimonials, contact   HostUpon at <a href="mailto:admin@HostUpon.com">admin@HostUpon.com</a>.    In some cases, HostUpon may be unable to remove your personal   information, in which case HostUpon will let you know why it is unable   to do so.</p>
				        </li>
					    <li><strong>Unsubscribe/Opt-out</strong><br>

HostUpon may request   certain personal information for the purposes of verifying the identity   of the individual seeking access or erasure of individual/customer   records.</p>
					      <p>To ensure customers receive the information they   need to manage their account and protect their privacy, HostUpon asks   that customers keep their contact and billing information up to date at all times.
