<p><strong>„Cookies“, „Web beacons“ and their use</strong><br>
1. The Company may collect the anonymous information about the Visitor by means of „cookies” and „web beacons“ technologies.<br>
2. „Cookie“ is a small text document with a unique identification number, which is transferred from the Website to the hard disc of the Visitor’s computer in order for the internet site administrator to be able to distinguish the Visitor’s computer and see the Visitor’s activity in the internet. The unique number identifies the Visitor’s browser every time the Visitor enters the Websites. „Cookie“ does not allow internet sites to remember any&nbsp; of the Visitor’s personal information (such as the Visitor’s name and address), which the Visitor could forget to protect.<br>
3. „Cookie“ allows the Company to remember the Visitor’s internet browser type automatically. In order to offer higher service quality to the Visitor, the Company may use „cookies“ for below listed reasons:<br>

This information is usually conserved in an encoded manner, which can only be deciphered by the Company;<br>
2. to protect the Visitor from illegal use of his login data;<br>
3. to be able to keep statistics, such as the number and flow of visitors. Such information is usually not associated with the Visitor’s personal information.<br>

5. „Web beacons“, also known as GIFs or one-pixel GIFs, are small graphic documents, which the Company may place in the Website or e-mails that the Company sends to the Visitor. Together „cookies” and „web beacons“ allow the Company to calculate the number of unique visitors in certain internet sites and the number of displays of certain internet sites. By the means of using „web beacons“ the Company can learn how often a certain internet site, the advertisement of which was sent to the Visitor by e-mail, was visited. Such information is not associated with the Visitor’s personal information.<br>
