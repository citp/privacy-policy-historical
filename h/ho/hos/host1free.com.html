The said information also includes the data that the Visitor sends within the net of the Company.</p>


                    <p id="persons-receiving-the-information"><strong>Persons receiving the information</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The Company reserves the right to pass the information regarding the Visitor, which is selected at its discretion, to any third parties as long as it does not breach the applicable laws.</p>
                    <p>2. The Company draws the Visitor's attention to the fact that links to other internet sites can be published on the Website. Some of these internet sites can retain Visitor's personal information and commercial internet sites can be using „cookies" and „web beacons“ (so-called „web spies") in their advertisements in order to gather information about the Visitor. Please read Chapter 4 of the Privacy policy, where you will learn more about advertising in the Website. The Privacy policy of the Company and its provisions do not comprise the privacy policies and provisions regarding the information collection that are applied by the third parties. The Company is not and shall not be held responsible for the actions of any third parties that collect information about the Visitor.</p>

                    <p id="cookies-web-beacons-and-their-use"><strong>„Cookies“, „Web beacons“ and their use</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The Company may collect the anonymous information about the Visitor by means of „cookies" and „web beacons“ technologies.</p>
                    <p>2. „Cookie“ is a small text document with a unique identification number, which is transferred from the Website to the hard disc of the Visitor's computer in order for the internet site administrator to be able to distinguish the Visitor's computer and see the Visitor's activity in the internet. The unique number identifies the Visitor's browser every time the Visitor enters the Websites. „Cookie“ does not allow internet sites to remember any  of the Visitor's personal information (such as the Visitor's name and address), which the Visitor could forget to protect.</p>
                    <p>3. „Cookie“ allows the Company to remember the Visitor's internet browser type automatically. In order to offer higher service quality to the Visitor, the Company may use „cookies“ for below listed reasons:</p>


                    <p>1. to be able to provide the most efficient and the highest quality services as possible. Retaining certain information in the „cookie“ documents or associating „cookie“ with the registration, favourite websites or a short Visitor's description in the Company's computer system. The Company can provide services for a greater number of visitors in a much quicker and more efficient  manner. This information is usually conserved in an encoded manner, which can only be deciphered by the Company;</p>
                    <p>2. to protect the Visitor from illegal use of his login data;</p>
                    <p>3. to be able to keep statistics, such as the number and flow of visitors. Such information is usually not associated with the Visitor's personal information.</p>
                    <p>4. The use of „cookie“ is an industrial standard and therefore they are used in many internet sites. There is a possibility to prevent the „cookie“ infiltration in the Visitor's computer or prohibit any forms of „cookie“. In such case some Services may partly or completely stop functioning.</p>
                    <p>5. „Web beacons“, also known as GIFs or one-pixel GIFs, are small graphic documents, which the Company may place in the Website or e-mails that the Company sends to the Visitor. Together „cookies" and „web beacons“ allow the Company to calculate the number of unique visitors in certain internet sites and the number of displays of certain internet sites. By the means of using „web beacons“ the Company can learn how often a certain internet site, the advertisement of which was sent to the Visitor by e-mail, was visited. Such information is not associated with the Visitor's personal information.</p>
                    <p>6. Any of the picture in the Website can be a „web beacon". Third parties that advertise on the Website or by any other means may use „web beacons“ .</p>

                    <p id="the-use-of-visitors-information"><strong>The use of Visitor's information</strong></p>
                    <p>1.

Listed below are the examples of the purposes for which the Company may use the collected information about the Visitor:</p>
                    <p>2. to be able to edit the Website contents as to what is the most relevant for the Visitor. In some cases the Company seeks to know the exact data about the Visitor in order to be able to offer special Services and directional advertising.</p>
                    <p>3. The Company collects the Visitor's anonymous data and shares them with the third parties (e.g., advertising contractors). The Company reveals to these persons the information about the number of Visitors, the number of Visitors that have seen a particular advertisement and / or clicked on a particular link in a particular Website, etc. The Company can also present all the demographic statistics of those Visitors, who noticed or clicked on the link of a particular advertising contractor. The Company can disclose the results of the anonymous surveys. None of the Visitor's personal information is usually disclosed during the process;</p>
                    <p>4. The Company uses common data for the statistical analysis of the Visitors' behaviour, seeking to establish the Visitors' needs and analyse how and where the available resources could be used in the most efficient manner.

                    <p>7. The Company may send e-mails or mails by post, as well as short messages (sms) to the Visitor's mobile phone, containing information about the Services, which according to the Company could possibly be of the Visitor's interest. The Company may combine the information it has about the Visitor with the information the third parties have about the Visitor in order to be able to offer interesting offers and new Services to the latter;</p>
                    <p>8. The Visitor's credit card information, telephone number and other data may be used while collecting and accumulating the information related to the Visitor's use of the paid Services.</p>

Credit card numbers that are used to pay for the paid Services are specially encoded by sending such information via internet.</p>
                    <p>2. The Company reminds that the Visitor is held solely responsible for the privacy of all of his / her data.

The Visitor should disconnect from the browser after having finished his / her work in order to prevent other persons' access to the Visitor's e-mail, personal information, especially when working with public or shared computers ( e.g., in a internet café, library, etc.).</p>
                    <p>3. The Company undertakes to attempt to protect Visitor's personal data that it deals with, however it must be taken into account that Visitor's information is sent via internet and the Company cannot and does not guarantee the security of any information submitted by the Visitor, including his / her personal data.</p>
