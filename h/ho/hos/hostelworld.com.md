Please note that where you access our booking engine on a third party website this privacy statement only applies to information we collect through your use of the booking engine, and does not data collected or held by the operator of the third party website.

Hostelworld has been processing online hostel reservations since 1999 and we have always placed the security of our internet transactions and our customers" credit card details as our top priority. We will continue to offer our customers the highest level of security available for online transactions and hope this reassures you when you make your reservations with us.

Hostelworld realises that some people are unsure about entering their personal details into websites and apps over the Internet.

### INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROCESS YOUR BOOKING

For us to process a booking for you on behalf of a travel services provider, we require some information from you. This includes your name, nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number and email address. Also, since we confirm your booking while you are on the Hostelworld Site, we require your credit or debit card details so we can guarantee your beds when you pay your deposit.

### WHO SEES YOUR INFORMATION

We are required to send your information to the travel services provider with which you booked travel services so that the travel service provider knows who you are and when you will use its travel services. We give your name, your nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number, your email address, your credit card details and of course, the details of your booking. The travel service provider requires this information to accept a confirmed booking from you. All travel service providers on whose behalf we facilitate bookings have agreed to the Hostelworld terms and conditions and accept this privacy policy.

We may also pass your personal information to third party service providers who process it on our behalf in order to allow us to provide the best service to you. For example, we use various technologies provided by Google, including its Maps product and its analytics products, to enhance the Hostelworld Sites.

### TARGETED ADVERTISING

We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of the travel related opportunities which we feature on the Hostelworld Sites. We work with our advertising partners in order to try and ensure that when you see an advert for a Hostelworld brand it will be relevant to you and your interests. This applies to adverts that are displayed on Hostelworld"s own websites (including the Hostelworld Sites, in Hostelworld emails, and on websites owned by third parties). We do this by allowing our third party advertisers to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to the Hostelworld Sites, such as the pages you visit on the Hostelworld Sites and the locations you appear to be interested in. We also provide third party advertisers with non-personally identifiable information that we collect about you when you use the Hostelworld Sites in order to only show you relevant adverts. We may also use such information in order to avoid showing you adverts on third party websites like Facebook and Twitter if we don"t think that you will be interested in them.

When we share your information with third party advertisers we always ensure that we do so in compliance with our obligations under data protection law. We may use technologies such as "hashing" to ensure that we do not provide our third party service providers with your personal data. For more information on how our third party advertising service providers gather information about your use of the Hostelworld Sites, please refer to our Cookies Policy which is available [here](https://web.archive.org/cookiespolicy.php).
