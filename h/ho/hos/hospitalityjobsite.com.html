    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact us. </p>
    <p>Please take a minute to read the following policy so you understand how we use the personal information we ask you to submit. As we update and expand our services, this policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. If you use any of our services, you agree to these terms. </p>

    <h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>
    <p>When you register with this site or one of its affiliated web sites, we ask you for personal information. We use this information to process your requests and to communicate with you about the status of your requests. We may also use your email address to send you newsletters to which you are subscribed during registration, as well as messages about any special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys, Beyond services, account updates, services that may be of interest to you, or administrative messages regarding your account.  Email list options can be managed under your account user settings.  </p>
    <p>By registering on or using our site, you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to our partners and affiliates. Beyond does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with third parties or non-affiliated companies, except as otherwise disclosed in this policy, or under the following circumstances:</p>
    <p>We disclose information:
        </p><ul>
            <li>to companies and individuals we employ to perform services on our behalf,</li>
            <li>if legally required to do so,</li>
            <li>to protect the rights or property of this site or our affiliated companies, or</li>
            <li>to protect the personal safety of users or the general public.</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p> 
    <p>Additionally, information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership of our company. </p>
    <p>In order to serve you better and more efficiently, we may also share anonymous aggregated information (relevant to the job search) about users with our partners and other third parties relevant to the job search.</p> 
    <p>We collect information from our users at several different points on our website. When you first register with us, we ask for your email address and a password. At this time, we may subscribe you to various email publications. You can unsubscribe from any or all publications at any time.  We will delete data on our site that you have provided to us, upon request, through our Contact Us form, found at the bottom of this page.</p>  
    <p>We also offer an Associate program, where associate members direct customers to the network through links on their Web sites. We ask associates for their site name (URL), mailing address, primary contact, pay-to address, technical contact, and other site-related information to determine whether a site will be included in our network. The information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for that program; none of this information is used for general marketing purposes.  </p>
    <p>In some cases our software and web site are utilized by our partners in a business alliance via their web community. In these cases, the information collected on our site is available to both companies. </p>
    <p>You should be aware that any personal information (such as email address or resumes), which you voluntarily display or distribute on our network and on the Internet can be collected and used by others, no different than posting this information in a newspaper. This may result in your receiving unsolicited messages from third parties for which Beyond.com is not responsible and has no ability to affect. </p>
	<p>This site uses the ClickTale web analytics service, which is not owned, operated or controlled by Beyond.com. We use the information collected by ClickTale service to improve your user experience.  ClickTale may record mouse clicks, mouse movements and scrolling activity, as well as any text you type in this website. ClickTale does not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter into this website. ClickTale does not track your browsing habits across web sites which do not use ClickTale services. For more information, see <a href="http://www.clicktale.com/privacy_service.aspx" target="_blank">Privacy Policy for Information Collected by the ClickTale Web Analytics Service</a>. You may disable this Service at <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html" target="_blank">http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html</a>.</p>

    <h3>Security and Access</h3> 

    <p>We have implemented technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access or improper use. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. </p>
    <p>When you place an order online at this site, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. This site uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.</p>
    <p>Users should not post personal information to any site if they are uncomfortable with the security of the site.  If you have any questions, please contact us. </p>

    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>This site is not intended for children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly or specifically collect information about children. This site does not and will not contact children under age 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent's permission. We believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out personal information. If you are concerned about your child's use of this site, we encourage you to use web-filtering technology to supervise your child's access to the site. For children 14 and up (high-school age), we also encourage you to participate in your child's experience with our site. With a little guidance, this site can prove very useful in finding a part-time or summer job for your child, as well as providing them with excellent career counseling information. </p>
