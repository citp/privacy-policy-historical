## What type of information does Hostway collect?

When you visit our Website, our Web server collects basic user information about you that includes your ISP’s domain, the time you accessed our Website, and the pages from within our Website that you visit, and this basic information is not personal information except as needed to prevent fraud or abuse of the system.

When you sign up for Hostway Services, you provide us with both contact and payment information. Contact information typically includes your name, address, and phone number. Payment information typically includes your credit card number. While you are a Hostway Client, we manage information with regard to your account status, choice of services, and Client logs. In addition, we may store Clients’ electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications.

## How Do We Use a Client’s Information?

If you have provided us with your contact information as a Hostway Client, we use that information to establish our services for you, such as creating and maintaining your Client Account and your choice of services. We use payment information for payment processing purposes only. We may also create and maintain Client logs in the normal course of providing service.

Our trusted affiliates are responsible for processing or handling some of the information we receive, such as order fulfillment for phone services. Those affiliates are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us including marketing and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.

In certain situations, Hostway may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We will not disclose Client personal and account information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Hostway, our Clients, or others. We may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable laws, respond to legal process, or where Hostway has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

Hostway also will not disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Hostway stores or transmits for its Clients except where: (a) it is a matter or public safety or policy; (b) it is in connection with the transfer of other business assets; (c) it is required to cooperate with orders, warrants, or other legal process that Hostway determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and (d) it is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Hostway and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime. If Hostway is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, and it results in a change of the ownership or use of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, then you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website.

Hostway disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by Clients or others. Hostway will, however, review, delete, or block access to communications that may harm Hostway, its Clients or third parties. The grounds on which Hostway may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of the TOU.

Hostway may use the information collected from you to direct service notices as well as provide you with other general information that may be of interest to you and information about our services or product offerings that you have opted to receive.

## Payment Processing

Hostway uses third party providers to provide credit card processing services on our Website. When you purchase a service or product from us we will share contact and credit card information as necessary for the third party to provide those payment processing services.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose including their own marketing services. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

## Client Interactions

Hostway may use your information to provide you, as our valued Client, with system information, information about new or upgraded products, and general information about Hostway itself if you have chosen to receive such offers or newsletters.

Please note that we will also use your contact information to notify you of important information regarding your account or services at our discretion and you may not opt out of receiving such service related email communications.

## Newsletters or Promotional Communications

Clients may opt out of receiving newsletters and/or promotional emails from Hostway by sending a request to [newsletter-unsubscribe@hostway.com](mailto:newsletter-unsubscribe@hostway.com), by using the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional communication, or by changing your email preferences in your account information. In this request, Clients must identify their domain name and contact information. Clients may not opt out of receiving information from Hostway which is essential for maintaining or updating Clients’ Account or system information.

## Testimonials

Hostway displays personal testimonials of satisfied Clients on our Website in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.

## Referrals

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Website. Hostway stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Your friend may contact us at [customers@hostway.com](mailto:customers@hostway.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

Our Website offers publicly accessible blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog, contact us at [customers@hostway.com](mailto:customers@hostway.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

## Surveys or Contests

From time-to-time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Website. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Website traffic or personalize the Website (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), or to send participants an email newsletter.

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests, and that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose including their own marketing. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

## How Do We Use a Visitor’s Information?

Hostway may collect basic user information from any visitor to the Website. This information is used to help us analyze Web traffic, improve the content of our Website and improve your experience on our Website.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

## Behavioral Advertising

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

You will continue to receive generic ads.

## Chat Function

Our Website may allow for a chat function. Chat functions allow you to participate in “live” online conversations with us on our Website. Although the transcripts from the chats may be stored internally on in-house servers for our records only, we collect no personal information about you when you participate unless you choose to provide that information to us.

## Social Media Features

Our Website also includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, such as the “Share This” button, or other interactive mini-programs that run on our Website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable that feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Frame

Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to www.hostway.com.

## How Can You Access or Delete Your Personal Information?

You can access your personal information, such as your address and contact information, at any time to correct, change or delete any of the data shared with us when you became a Client of Hostway. As a Client of Hostway you can access your personal information by clicking on the “Log In” link on the header of the Website. Your account information is secure and is accessible by using a password that you select.

Upon written request Hostway will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. To request this information please contact us at [customers@hostway.com](mailto:customers@hostway.com).

## How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?

We will retain your information for as long as your Client Account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at customers@hostway.com. We will retain and use your information only as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Security

Hostway has security measures in place to help prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. When you place an order online, your information, including your credit card number, is protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. This encrypts order data and is designed to aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of that Client information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can send email us at [compliance@hostway.com](mailto:compliance@hostway.com).

## Links

Our Website provides links to other websites, sites that may be maintained by companies that are not affiliates of ours. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites and we encourage you to use caution. In particular, we recommend that you view the privacy policy posted on each site to confirm the sites policies are acceptable to you. This Policy applies solely to information collected by this Website.

## Children’s Privacy

Hostway does not sell products or services for purchase by children. Clients must be at least 18 years of age. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided personal information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information and terminate the child’s account from our databases.

## Changes to our Policy

If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes to this Policy, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a prominent notice on our home page.
