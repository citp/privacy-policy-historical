  3. Directly from Users.



**5\. Information HostDime Collects from Web Server Logs**

  1. Internet protocol address
  2. The type of browser or computer used
  3. The number of links clicked within HostDime’s website
  4. The state or country from which our website was accessed

**6\. Information Collected by HostDime Directly from Users**

  


**a. Registration Information**

To purchase services from HostDime, Users must provide detailed information including contact information to HostDime, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, and phone numbers. Users are required to provide this information to HostDime in order to purchase HostDime services. During the purchase process, Users may provide optional information such as instant messager details and secondary, billing, or abuse email addresses to HostDime. If that information is provided, it is covered by this Privacy Policy; however, providing it is voluntary. This information is a subset of Identification Tools, and is referred to individually as “Registration Information.”

**b. Identification Tools**

HostDime may use automated Identification Tools like cookies and Google Analytics. Each of these Identification Tools work differently, however, they all collect information related to the website you came to HostDime from, a User’s operating system, browser type, where Users go on HostDime’s website, length of time on HostDime’s website, and where a User goes after visiting HostDime’s website. In addition, Identification Tools may keep Users logged into HostDime’s system. From time-to-time, HostDime may use Identification Tools that will be used to serve advertising and other information to Users after they visit HostDime’s website. Because the technologies underlying Identification Tools differ, Users may, or may not, be able to choose not to provide information to them.

**c. Support Information**

When Users contact HostDime for support for their services they will be asked to match certain information that is in their Registration Information. This information will be used to identify them personally. In the course of providing support to Users, HostDime may annotate the Registration Information with information disclosed while providing support (Support Information).

**d. FAQ and Forum Information**

HostDime offers Users the ability to exchange information about its services, and their experiences with these services (Forum Information). Forum Information is publicly accessible and may be indexed by search engines and other tools. Users are not required to disclose information that will identify them personally in order to participate in these tools. All Forum Information may be accessed and used by third parties for purposes known and unknown to HostDime.

**7\. Security Monitoring**

HostDime takes the security of its network very seriously. To ensure network security, data integrity and privacy, HostDime uses programs that monitor network traffic and access to its network. These programs collect information regarding User’s use of HostDime’s services, website and network (Traffic Information).

**8\. How HostDime Uses Information Covered by this Privacy Policy**

**a. Generally**

  


  1. HostDime is required to comply with relevant laws, regulations and judicial orders. Information covered by this Privacy Policy may be disclosed outside HostDime if HostDime determines, in its sole discretion. that such a disclosure is necessary or required. HostDime may also disclose this information if, in its sole discretion, such disclosure is necessary or required to protect its interests or the interests of its customers.
  2. HostDime may disclose information covered by this Privacy Policy in connection with the sale of its business.
  3. HostDime may aggregate information covered by this Privacy Policy and disclose it outside its business. This information will not identify Users individually.
  4. HostDime may use information covered by this Privacy Policy to contact you directly to respond to questions, provide its services to you, manage your account or to inform you of service announcements.
  5. HostDime may use information covered by this Privacy Policy to inform you of new products and services. In informing you of new products and services, HostDime may include third party products and services. While HostDime may use information that identifies you individually to market these third party products and services, that information is not disclosed to the third parties. In this use of User information, third parties will only receive aggregate information. However, should a User respond to a marketing announcement, third parties will become aware of the User individually. Users may opt-out of receiving this information by clicking “unsubscribe” in any marketing material, or unsubscribe from your CORE profile. Only the email address from that communication will be removed from marketing lists.



**b. Specific Information**

  


  1. **Web Server Logs (described inparagraph 5)**

Information collected from Web Server Logs is not disclosed beyond HostDime except as set out in paragraph 5 in this Privacy Policy.

  2. **Registration Information (described inparagraph 6)**

HostDime will use Registration Information throughout its business and will pass Registration Information on to third parties for processing and use as necessary to provide HostDime’s services to Users. HostDime requires these third parties to limit their use of Registration Information to those uses that facilitate providing HostDime’s services to Users.

  3. **Identification Tools (described inparagraph 6)**

Information collected using Identification Tools, other than Registration Information, may identify Users individually. This information will be used to provide HostDime’s marketing information to Users. Users may enter or delete email addresses in the “Account” interface to control marketing messages. Third parties may use this information in the aggregate; however, they are contractually prohibited from using this information to identify Users individually. HostDime uses cookies to save User’s preferences and login information, and provide personalized functionality.

  4. **Support Information (described inparagraph 6)**

Support Information may identify Users individually. In addition to providing support to Users, HostDime may disclose Support Information to third party vendors in order to provide the support requested by the User. These third parties may disclose and use Support Information to improve their business processes and for marketing. Unless necessary to provide support to Users, HostDime will not disclose Support Information containing information that identifies Users individually to these third parties. During a support request, Users may request that HostDime not disclose Support Information to third parties. This request will prevent HostDime from providing support to Users.

  5. **Traffic Information (described inparagraph 7)**

HostDime uses technical security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, alternation or unauthorized disclosure of information under our control. HostDime uses security measures including and not limited to: firewalls, nonpublic facing systems, complex passwords, anti-virus, and mitigation and detection software. When HostDime asks Users to provide financial information (such as a credit card number) that data is protected using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Electronic communication (for example: email, online chat, or instant messaging) that Users may send HostDime may not be secure unless HostDime advises a User in advance that security measures will be in place prior to transmitting the information. Users should not send confidential information such as financial information, social security numbers or passwords to HostDime through unsecured electronic communication.

Information covered by this Privacy Policy may be deleted upon a User’s request. However, we reserve the right to retain information necessary to protect our interests. Unless specifically set out herein, information covered by this Privacy Policy will be retained by HostDime following termination of a User’s Agreement.

We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share their data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
