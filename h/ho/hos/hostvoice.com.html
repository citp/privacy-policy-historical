	<p><b>What is the purpose of this Privacy Policy? </b></p>

      firm commitment to our users. <strong>Your privacy is our top concern</strong> and we want you to be fully aware of how your information is being treated. The following <strong>discloses our information gathering

      and dissemination practices</strong> for this website: www.HostVoice.com/.net. Please

      continue reading for complete details on the HostVoice privacy policy. </p>

    <p><b>What information do we collect? </b></p>

    <p>When you submit a hosting request, you are required to enter your full name and eMail address. Optionally, you may choose to enter your phone number and instant messenger information. This data is <strong>securely stored</strong> on our servers for a limited period of time.</p>
    <p><strong>How is my information treated?</strong></p>
    <p>Your privacy is  a <b>very important issue</b> to us and we take all of the necessary precautions to make sure your <b>information is
secure</b>. We <b>only</b> work with trustworthy companies that share our concerns regarding your privacy. Rest assured, that your <b>contact
information will only be used</b> to provide you with up to 4 hosting quotes.<strong> You will not receive any spam or unsolicited letters from us.
Period.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>How do hosting companies treat my information?</strong></p>
    <p>HostVoice releases a limited amount of information to our partners (hosting companies) that use it to send you a custom hosting proposal based on your request. We work with well-known partners that have built a solid reputation over the past years and will treat your information with the same care, as we do. </p>
    <p><b>Does the HostVoice website use cookies? If so, how are cookies used on

      the website? </b></p>



    <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user's

      hard drive for record-keeping purposes while visiting a site. Like most

      major websites, HostVoice uses cookies on certain pages of our site. Cookies

      make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your passwords

      and preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the HostVoice website

      remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future

      activities at our site, and which allows you to enter your password less

      frequently while visiting our website. We may also use cookies to deliver

      content specific to your interests. Our cookies do not contain any content

      specific information. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying

      information although cookies may enable us to relate your use of our website

      to personally identifying information that you previously submitted. For

      example, it enables us to enhance personalization on the website, such

      as calling you by name when you return to our site. Most browsers are initially

      set up to accept cookies, although your browser may permit you to decline

      cookies. If you do decline cookies, your use of our site may be slowed

      because you may need to re-enter information. </p>



    <p><b>What are the policies of linked sites and other third parties? </b></p>



    <p>This privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information

      we collect from you. Although you may interact with hosting suppliers as

      a result of visiting our site, or link to other sites or third parties

      via our website, HostVoice is not responsible for the privacy practices

      of third parties or the content of linked sites. We encourage you to read

      the posted privacy policy whenever interacting with any website. </p>



    <p><b>To whom does HostVoice release information? </b></p>



    <p>HostVoice only releases specific customer information to third parties,

      such as Hosting suppliers when you select a supplier. The information transfer

      is necessary in order to facilitate your transaction to the new supplier

      and complete account set-up. Please be aware that despite our best intentions

      and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission

      over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Moreover, we may

      be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or to third

      parties under certain circumstances, such as illegal activity on our Site.

      HostVoice reserves the right to release personally identifiable information

      to law enforcement or other government officials, as HostVoice, in our

      sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary or appropriate. By submitting

      a HostVoice request, you agree to submit your contact details to the featured

      third party service providers. </p>



    <p><b>How will I know about changes in the Privacy Policy? </b></p>



    <p>HostVoice reserves the right to update this privacy policy from time to

      time. Please visit this page periodically so that you will be apprised

      of any changes. However, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information

      in accordance with the Privacy Policy that was in effect at the time the

      information was collected. If at any point we should decide to use that

      information differently, we will notify users by way of E-mail so that

      users can approve or disapprove of such use.</p>
