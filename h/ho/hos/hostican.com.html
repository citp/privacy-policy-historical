		          The primary purpose of collecting  information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, effective, and  personalized experience.&nbsp; We will only  collect information about you that we consider necessary to achieve this  purpose.&nbsp; </p>
				  <p>Generally, HostICan collects  personally identifiable information in two ways.&nbsp; Some information is gathered when you order  service from us.&nbsp; This includes your  name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, user name, and password.&nbsp; Where possible, we indicate which fields are  required and which fields are optional.&nbsp;  We also collect personal information when you report a problem with our  services through the Site’s feedback form or contact email addresses.&nbsp; If you contact HostICan, we may keep a record  of that correspondence.&nbsp; </p>

				  Data collection devices, such as  “cookies,” are used to store, and sometimes track, information about you.&nbsp; Generally, these cookies help provide  personalized services and promote trust and safety.&nbsp; A cookie is a small file containing a small  amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and placed on  your computer’s hard drive to assist us in providing our services.&nbsp; All pages on the Site where you are prompted  to login or that are customizable request that you accept cookies.&nbsp; Cookies are only read by the server that placed  them and are unable to execute any code or virus.&nbsp; Most cookies are “session cookies,” and are  automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.&nbsp; <p></p>
				  <p>More specifically, we use cookies to remind us  of who you are and to access your account information in order to deliver to  you a more personalized service.&nbsp; This  cookie is set when you register or “Sign In” and is modified when you “Sign  Out” of our services.&nbsp; We also use  cookies to measure your visiting patterns in the aggregate.&nbsp; We use this research to understand how our users’  habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new  experience on HostICan.com a better one.&nbsp;  We may also use this information to better personalize the content,  banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our Site.&nbsp; Finally, cookies will allow you to enter your  password less frequently during a session.&nbsp;  You are always free to decline our cookies if you wish and if your  browser permits.</p>
				  <p><img src="http://www.hostican.com/image_files/titles/what-are-ip-addresses-and-how-does-hostican.com-use-them.gif" alt="What information do we collect?">
				    <br>
			      When your web browser requests a  web page from another computer on the Internet, such as hostican.com,  it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the  information. This is called your computer's "IP address." (IP stands  for "Internet protocol.") For many users accessing the Internet, the  IP address will be different every time you log on.&nbsp; We record the IP Addresses that access  HostICan.com along with related information such as your browser type and  operating system. This information helps us, in part, learn about the  geographical distribution of our website visitors and the technology they use  to access our site so that we can improve our Site.			      </p>
