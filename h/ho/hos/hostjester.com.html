<h2>Host Jester Privacy Policy:</h2>
<p class="text_normal">IMPORTANT!  THIS PRIVACY POLICY GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THIS SITE, WHICH IS PROVIDED BY OUR COMPANY.  BY ACCESSING THIS SITE, YOU ARE INDICATING YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OF USE.  THESE TERMS OF USE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY OUR COMPANY AT ANY TIME IN ITS DISCRETION.  YOUR USE OF THIS SITE AFTER SUCH CHANGES ARE IMPLEMENTED CONSTITUTES YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES.  PLEASE CONSULT THESE TERMS OF USE PRIOR TO EVERY USE FOR ANY CHANGES.</p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make  your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible,  and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools,  and opportunities with complete confidence.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment  to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company  collects information from all end users of our Internet services (the  "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do not have  accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or  pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what  we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and  Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We  request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</strong><br>
  <br>
  Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from  Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and  the network of Web sites accessible through our Service.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Registration:&nbsp; Clients may be asked to provide certain personal  information when they sign up for our Products or Services including  name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit  card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the  Services. The personal information collected from Members during the  registration process is used to manage each Client's account (such as  for billing purposes). This information may be shared with third  parties, as stated herein, or in special circumstances.<br>
  <br>
  However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal  information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who  subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the  purpose of offering you other products and services.<br>
</p>
<p>In this instance, personal  information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may  also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal  information Members provide during registration (such as the total  number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail  below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to  sell advertisements that appear on the Services.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Also, with purchases, we supply our member's  contact information, to our business partners, who then may contact the  member by telephone after the member purchase. Sales proceeds are  collected by the that business partner company.&nbsp; We also may supply  other companies with contact information, for mail offers we believe  would be of interest to our members, with or without compensation from  those companies.&nbsp; At times we may send an advertisement for a third  party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and forward the  purchaser's information to that third party.<br>
  <br>
Our Company Partners and  Sponsors:&nbsp; Some products and services may be offered to Visitors and  Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller  or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these  products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain  personal information.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
  Online Shopping:&nbsp; At some Web sites, you can  purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as  a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In many  cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your  name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card  information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a <br>
  recipient, you may be asked to provide information  about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone  number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any  personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please  exercise care when doing so.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  If you order services or products directly from  our company, we use the personal information you provide to process that  order.&nbsp; We do share this information with outside parties that we do  business with.<br>
  <br>
  Online Advertisements:&nbsp; Our company may display  our online advertisements. In those cases we share information about our  Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well  as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.</p>
<p>Additionally, in some instances,  we use this information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint  ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us  the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement  tailored to the audience. Based upon the information we have collected,  we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience.  Our company does share personal information about its Visitors or  Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.<br>
  <br>
  Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or  Members send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is  used to answer the email inquiry we receive.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Voluntary Customer Surveys:&nbsp; We may periodically  conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our  customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with  important information that helps us to improve the types of products and  services we offer and how we provide them to you.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  We may take the information we receive from  individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or  aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to  create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as  gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector,  or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated  information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to  develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally  identifying information may be shared with third parties.<br>
  <br>
  YOU MUST BE EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OR OLDER TO ACCESS  THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE, YOU ARE NOT  PERMITTED TO ACCESS THIS WEB SITE FOR ANY REASON. DUE TO THE AGE  RESTRICTIONS FOR USE OF THIS WEB SITE, NO INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THIS  WEB SITE, FALLS WITHIN THE CHILD ONLINE PRIVACY ACT (COPA) AND IS NOT  MONITORED AS DOING SO.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Public Forums:&nbsp; Please remember that any  information you may disclose in any Member Directory, or other public  areas of our Web sites or the Internet, becomes public information. You  should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information  in these public areas.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Our Company's Commitment to Data Security:&nbsp;  Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to  protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our  control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security  of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security  measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining  this information.&nbsp;<br>
