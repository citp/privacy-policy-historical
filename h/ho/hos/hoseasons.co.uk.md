## **Why are your card details safe?**

Our Secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and is among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, including your credit or debit card number, name and address, which means that your details cannot be read as the information travels over the internet. Only Hoseasons can read your personal information.

Equally, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information provided by our customers.

In the extremely unlikely event that your card details are obtained and used fraudulently, most banks and credit card providers will either cover all charges resulting from this unauthorised use of your credit details or will limit your liability to £50. Please check your card agreement to establish your coverage for liability.

Did you know? The risk of credit card fraud is 100 times greater when you hand your card to the waiter in a restaurant than when you shop on the Internet! Modern day encryption technology, used by many Web sites like ours, virtually eliminates credit card fraud on the Internet.

  


## **Privacy Statement**

In order to process your booking, we need to collect certain personal details from you. These details will usually include the names and addresses of party members, credit/debit card or other payment details and special requirements such as those relating to any disability or medical condition which may affect the chosen holiday arrangements. If we need any other personal details, we will tell you before we obtain them from you.

We need to pass on your personal details to the companies and organisations who need to know them so that your holiday can be provided (for example your airline, hotel, other supplier, credit/debit card company or bank). Such companies and organisations may be outside the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein if your holiday is to take place or to involve suppliers outside these countries.

Where you give us details relating to your physical or mental health or condition, we will ask you to give us your written consent to our holding, using and passing on such information. Except where expressly permitted by the Data Protection Act, we will only deal with the personal details you give us as set out above unless you agree otherwise. For example, if we wish to use any of your personal details for marketing purposes, we will tell you this when we ask for the details and give you the opportunity to say no if you do not want us to do so.

We promise to keep all personal details you give us in connection with your booking confidential. We have appropriate security measures in place to protect this information. 

You may write to us or email us to ask us whether we or someone on our behalf is holding personal details of yours or is carrying out any operation in relation to any of them. You are entitled to ask us what details of yours are being held or processed, for what purpose and to whom they may be or have been disclosed. We will charge a fee to respond to such a request. We promise to respond to your request within 40 days of receiving your written request and fee.
