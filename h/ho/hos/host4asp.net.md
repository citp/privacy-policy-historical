# Privacy Policy - Host4ASP.NET

Host4ASP.NET regards customers' privacy as the most important matter. We work out this Privacy Policy to show how we collect and use customers' information as well as make a commit for the security and privacy of customers' information. We guarantee that we will never violate this policy.

### Information Collected

Customers are required to provide some personal information when signing up the hosting service. The information includes name, address, email, and phone number, and this type of collected information is used to finish the registration and manage each member's account. Besides, there is also some other information necessary for signing up the service, like credit card and PayPal account. When submitting the order, customers need to offer the credit card number or PayPal account information. 

We use the collected information for multiple purposes, including the service transaction, sales inquiries, support inquiries, and the notification of service. In this case, we have to disclose the information to the banking institutions, affiliates, and contractors. We strictly protect your information from sharing by the third parties, unless under some special conditions. For instance, if customers cooperate with the company to promote a certain service, the company needs to provide a part of customer's personal information, such as the username, name, and address. The information is used for the purpose of enabling customers and the company access to the results of the promotion.

### Domain Registration

Frankly, customer's domain registration information legally has to be published to the public. The information is stored in a database named as WHOIS. Everyone can access to the WHOIS database and view the registration information of each registrant. However, some people may intentionally steal the domain registration information and make use of it to do something illegal. To address this problem, the company uses the alternative information to replace the true information so that customer's domain registration information is not able to be seen by others.

### Social Media

Host4ASP.NET is connected with Google+, Twitter, and Facebook, which include some social media features, like the Like Button of Facebook and the comment section included in each social media. Those features may collect your IP address and track which page you have visited. When making comments to a post, it probably discloses some personal information to public. In this case, customers need to be cautious about their individual information and don't disclose too much privacy when signing up a social media. 

### Customer Surveys

We keep doing customer surveys regularly and encourage our customers to actively join in those surveys. In the survey, customers are required to provide some important information that is used to help us improve the service. In some cases, the survey may be conducted by the third parties. However, we make a solemn promise to remain customer's personal information and responses extremely confidential. Note that customers have the right to determine whether participate in the survey or not. Participation in the customer survey is completely voluntary.

We aggregate the information that we have received from the responding to our customer surveys to create broader responses to the survey questions. For example, the information is about age, gender, hobbies, education, residence, job, or the geographic information. Based on the collected information, we will improve our services and do the best to meet customers' expectations. Thus, customers are able to enjoy more efficient, reliable and trust-worthy services. Meanwhile, the aggregated information does us a favor to develop new products and services. Note that, the aggregated information and the non-personal information may be shared with third parties.
