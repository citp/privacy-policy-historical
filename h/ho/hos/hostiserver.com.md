# Privacy policy - HostiServer

This Privacy Policy only applies to this Website. It does not apply to any Websites that might be operated by Hostiserver’s clients or their clients. Hostiserver’s clients may or may not have their own privacy policy. If you have questions about a Hostiserver’s client's privacy policy you must contact that client directly. Hostiserver expressly denies any responsibility for any information that you provide to a Hostiserver client or a client of a Hostiserver client.

This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the Terms of Services which is incorporated herein by reference (<https://www.hostiserver.com/terms-of-service>).

If Subscribers use Services, we request personally identifiable information from them on our order form. Subscribers must provide contact information (such as name, email and mailing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, CVV and expiration date). During the purchase process, Subscribers may provide optional information to us. If that information is provided, it is covered by this Privacy Policy; however, providing it is voluntary.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Hostiserver is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to this Web site ("Site"). To accomplish this, we have implemented a comprehensive Privacy Policy that governs all information collected on or submitted to our Site. By accessing, browsing or using the Site, you acknowledge that you read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions of Hostiserver’s Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not access, browse, or use this Site.

## The Information We Collect and How We Use It

**Non-Personal and Aggregated Information.** When you visit our Site, we may log general data, such as your domain name (e.g., [www.Hostiserver.com](https://www.hostiserver.com/)), the name of the Web page from which you entered our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, and how much time you spend on each page. We use this information to continually monitor and improve our Site and for internal analysis. In particular, we use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track Subscriber's movement, and gather information for aggregate use. (IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.)   
**Personal Information.** As a visitor to our Site, you may choose to use the Site to send us personal information (e.g., your name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address); for example when you send a question via the Site, register for a particular service, or submit your resume through our Site. Anytime you submit personal information for a specific purpose using the Site, your information is used for that purpose only unless you consent otherwise or as required by law.

When you submit personal information to Hostiserver on this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in another country, which may not provide privacy protections similar to those your country provides.  
We do not send unsolicited e-mail to you or other visitors to our Site. We use e-mail to respond to e-mail messages from you, to confirm product or service orders placed online and to engage other communication that you have authorized or that we have determined necessary to more effectively service you and our customers.

We do not intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13.

In many cases, you choose the amount of information you supply (e.g., when sending us information through the Site, you may choose to include only an e-mail address and not a telephone number or mailing address for replies). There may be instances where some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. In such cases, if you do not provide mandatory personal information with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

**We may collect the following additional data about each user:**  
1\. Date and time of:  
\- most recent successful and unsuccessful authentication  
\- last change of password  
2\. Number of good logins and failed attempts.  
3\. Your most recent passwords - to make sure you follow the prevailing security policy regarding password re-use.  


When you login and / or change your password, we may record further information in log files, such as the IP address used, in line with the purposes stated above. This information can help in following up any doubtful activity relating to your account. It will not be used to monitor your activity, except to allow the removal of the account when no longer used.
