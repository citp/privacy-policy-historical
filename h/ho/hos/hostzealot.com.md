### About Cookies and Web Beacons

Nowadays, cookies are used on majority of websites. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that while using our website does not require you to use cookies, certain pages may not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies.

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is uploaded from a website to the hard drive of your computer so that the website may identify you. This unique number identifies your browser, but not you, to HostZealot servers whenever you visit HostZealot website. A cookie will not let a website know any personal information about you, such as your real name and address. The coding in the cookies lets us know that you are using a particular computer but nothing more. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information or transmit any information to anyone.

To help serve you better, HostZealot uses cookies to:

• Help us remember who you are through your browser settings so that we can offer and provide personalized services. Our system uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about what is done and seen across HostZealot website. Cookies also allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit.

• Measure traffic patterns. Without cookies, it would be difficult for us to know that certain website sections are more popular than other sections. This information helps us better understand when to offer new services or improve our website.

• Estimate audience size. Cookies help us know whether users have seen particular displays or not, including advertisements.

• Display advertisements. HostZealot and third party advertising networks used by HostZealot may use cookies when serving advertisements.

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. HostZealot website pages may also contain web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help us determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.
