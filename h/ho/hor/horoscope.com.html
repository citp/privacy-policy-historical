                information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your
                trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice
                describes our privacy policy. By visiting Horoscope.com, you are
                accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
				</p>
                <p>What Personal Information About Customers Does Horoscope.com
                Gather?</p>
                <p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize
                and continually improve your shopping experience at Horoscope.com.
                Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
                <p>Information You Give Us:<br>
                We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site
                or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide
                certain information, but then you might not be able to take
                advantage of many of our features. We use the information that
                you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests,
                customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and
                communicating with you.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Automatic Information:<br>
                We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
                interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use
                "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information
                when your Web browser accesses Horoscope.com. A number of
                companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites
                anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a
                personalized experience at Horoscope.com if we cannot recognize
                you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>E-mail Communications:<br>
                To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often
                receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Horoscope.com
                if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our
                customer list to lists received from other companies, in an
                effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.</p>
                <p>Information from Other Sources:<br>
                For reasons such as improving personalization of our service
                (for example, providing better product recommendations or
                special offers that we think will interest you), we might
                receive information about you from other sources and add it to
                our account information. We also sometimes receive updated
                delivery and address information from our shippers or other
                sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next
                purchase or communication more easily.</p>
                <p>What About Cookies?</p>
                <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
                computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
                systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such
                as 1-Click purchasing, New for You, and storage of items in your
                Shopping Cart between visits. The "help" portion of
                the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your
                browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
                notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
                cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full
                advantage of some of Horoscope.com's coolest features, and we
                recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
                <p>Does Horoscope.com Share the Information It Receives?</p>
                <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our
                business, and we are not in the business of selling it to
                others. We share customer information only with the subsidiaries
                Horoscope.com controls and as described below.</p>
                <p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:<br>
                We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases,
                these businesses operate stores at Horoscope.com or sell
                offerings to you at Horoscope.com. In other cases, we operate
                stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with
                these businesses. You can tell when another business is involved
                in your transactions, and we share customer information related
                to those transactions with that business.</p>
                <p>Agents:<br>
                We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions
                on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering
                packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive
                information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing
                marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and
                providing customer service. They have access to personal
                information needed to perform their functions, but may not use
                it for other purposes.</p>
                <p>Promotional Offers:<br>
                Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Horoscope.com
                customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do
                not give that business your name and address.</p>
                <p>Business Transfers:<br>
                As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
                stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information
                generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in
                the unlikely event that Horoscope.com, or substantially all of
                its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be
                one of the transferred assets.</p>
                <p>Protection of Horoscope.com and Others:<br>
                We release account and other personal information when we
                believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or
                apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the
                rights, property, or safety of Horoscope.com, our users, or
                others. This includes exchanging information with other
                companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
                reduction.</p>
                <p>With Your Consent:<br>
                Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when
                information about you might go to third parties, and you will
                have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
                <p>How Secure Is Information About Me?</p>
                <p>We work to protect the security of your information during
                transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
                encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five
                digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of
                course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the
                appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is
                important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
                personal passwords and to your computer. Be sure to sign off
                when finished using a shared computer.</p>
                <p>What Information Can I Access?</p>
                <p>Horoscope.com gives you access to the following information
                about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain
                cases, updating that information. This list will change as our
                Web site evolves:<br>
                - Your Ordered Report</p>
                <p>What Choices Do I Have?</p>
                <p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide
                information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase
                or to take advantage of Horoscope.com's many paid and free
                services and features, such as Funny Genie and BioRythms. You
                can add or update certain information on pages such as your
                email address for our newsletter, or for a paid order not older
                than 90 days.</p>
                <p>When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the
                prior version for our records. The "help" portion of
                the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your
                browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
                notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
                cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use such
                important features as 1-Click and New for You if you do not use
                cookies. Click here to explore products that offer anonymous
                browsing. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides
                useful information about online privacy on its own Web site,
                Site Seeing on the Internet.</p>
                <p>Children</p>
                <p>Horoscope.com does not sell products for purchase by
                children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If
                you are under 18, you may use Horoscope.com only with
                involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>
                <p>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</p>
                <p>If you choose to visit Horoscope.com, your visit and any
                dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our <a href="http://www.horoscope.com/legaldisclaimer.htm">Conditions
                of Use</a>, including limitations on damages, arbitration of
                disputes, and application of the law of the state of
                Washington.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the
                Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that
                we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the
                time of use. Check our Web site frequently to see recent
                changes.</p>
                <p>Example of Information You Give Us:</p>
                <p>You provide most such information when you search, buy, post,
                participate in a contest, questionnaire, or online game or tool,
