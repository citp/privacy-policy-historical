							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">I. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT</b><br><br>
							
							We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our Sites, when you send us information or communications, and/or when you use our Offerings. "<b>Personal Data</b>" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "<b>Anonymous Data</b>" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We may also collect or develop aggregated information, which may include Anonymous Data and Personal Data, provided that such information does not personally identify you or any of our other users ("<b>Aggregated Data</b>"). We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
							<br><br><br>
							
							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">II. DATA WE COLLECT</b><br><br>
							
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A.	Personal Data That You Provide to Us.</b>  In order to provide you with personalized services and features we ask you to register and establish your personal profile ("<b>Profile</b>"). During the registration process we will ask you for Personal Data such as your name, telephone number, gender, birth information, e-mail address, password, place of residence, zip code, etc. This Personal Data is used to customize the Offerings to you and to provide you with personalized service. Depending on the part of the Offerings you are accessing, you may be asked at various times, for example, by filling out a form or survey, to provide Personal Data such as name, gender, e-mail address, birth date, and birth location.  Personal Data is collected primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our Offerings.
							<br><br>
							<u>Orders</u>
							<br>If you purchase a service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you during the account creation process. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  
							<br><br>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
							<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>B.	Personal Data Collected via Technology.</b>  To make our Offerings more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect Personal Data from you, including browser type, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.  Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our Sites.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>C.	Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others.</b>  If you decide to submit information about a third party, we will collect the third party's Personal Data in order to personalize the Offerings for such third party. You or the third party may contact us to request the removal of this information from our database, by sending us an email to delete@horoscope.com which indicates for which email address you would like us delete information.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>D.	Advertising.</b>  If there is advertising on the Sites, such advertising may employ the use of cookies or other methods to track hits and clickthroughs. We are not responsible for advertiser cookies or how the information gathered through their use might be used.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>E.	Children.</b>  We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from users who are under the age of 13. 
							<br><br><br>
							
							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">III.	USE OF YOUR DATA</b><br><br>
							
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A. General.</b>  In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We use your Personal Data (i.e., e-mail address, gender, and password) to personalize our Offerings; to deliver personalized information to you; to send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories; to respond to your questions should you ask an advisor a question; to provide you with electronic newsletters; and to send you special offers related to our Offerings and for other marketing purposes of Horoscope.com. Your e-mail address together is used to secure your Profile and to make our personalized e-mail services available to you.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>B. Creation and Use of Anonymous and Aggregated Data.</b>  We may create Anonymous Data and Aggregated Data from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data and Aggregated Data for trend analysis, and to better understand patterns of usage so that we may enhance the content of our Offerings and improve Site navigation. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data and Aggregated Data to third party companies in our discretion. For example, demographic and profile data is shared with our advertisers only in the form of Aggregated Data. Aggregated Data helps our advertisers to tailor their services to the collective characteristics of users of the Site. 
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>C. IP Addresses.</b>  We use your IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web sites, and to track trends and statistics.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>D. Cookies.</b>  When you view our Sites or advertisements, we might store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "<b>cookie</b>" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive to facilitate your current and future visits to our Site. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, save passwords so you won't have to enter it each time you visit the site, and for other purposes. You can set your web browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept the cookie. You can also set your browser to disable cookies. However, some parts of the Sites, including our registered customer account web sites, may not work properly if you disable or reject cookies.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 
							<br><br>
							<u>Third Party Cookies</u>
							<br>
							The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  These third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.  
							<br><br>

							<b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b>
							<br>
							Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 
							<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>E. Feedback.</b>  If you provide feedback on any of our Offerings to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Data. We will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Data in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>F. E-mail Address.</b>  The e-mail address you submit to receive our Offerings will never be sold to any third party. All personalized e-mail that you select to receive as well as the special offers from our advertisers will be sent to you exclusively by Horoscope.com. 
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>G. Facebook Connect or other OpenID provider.</b> You can log in to some of our sites using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
			<br><br>
			We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at privacy@horoscope.com.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.				
							<br><br><br>
							
							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">IV.	DISCLOSURE OF YOUR DATA</b><br><br>
							
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A. </b>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy. Although we currently do not have a parent company, we may in the future.  We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company (if we have one in the future), any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "<b>Affiliates</b>"), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Horoscope.com Inc. operates multiple web sites, including Astrocenter.com, Horoscope.com, and Psychiccenter.com, and we may share your Personal Data with, and receive Personal Data from, all of the web sites operated by Horoscope.com Inc. If Horoscope.com Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web sites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>B. Co-branded Service Offerings.</b> We may enter into agreements with certain businesses (each, a "<b>Partner Company</b>") pursuant to which we provide the Partner Company with a URL and a customer registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the Partner Company, and the Partner Company distributes and promotes the URL to its customers.  A Partner Company may want access to Personal Data that we collect from its customers.  As a result, if you register on a website through a Partner Company, we may provide your Personal Data to the Partner Company.  Because we do not control the privacy practices of our Partner Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies. 
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>C. Third Party Services.</b> We reserve the right to offer services and products from third party vendors ("<b>Third Party Vendors</b>") to you on the Sites, such as via newsletters or special offers, based on the preferences that you identify during the registration process and based on your subsequent preferences. We may share Aggregated Data about our user base with these Third Party Vendors; this information does not identify individual users.   We do not link Aggregated Data with Personal Data. 
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>D. Third Party Contractors.</b> We may share your Personal Data with third party contractors or service providers ("<b>Third Party Contractors</b>") to provide you with the services that we offer you though our Sites; to conduct quality assurance testing; to provide technical support; to process payments; or to provide specific services in accordance with your instructions. These Third Party Contractors are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by us. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with our Third Party Contractors for the sole purpose of providing the Offerings to you.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>E. Other Disclosures.</b> Due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other Personal Data will not be disclosed to third parties under certain circumstances. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under court order, subpoena, or other circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. In addition, where we ask for your Personal Data and you are notified that the information we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties, and in cases where you opt-in to share your Personal Data with third parties, those disclosures and opt-ins will override anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>

			We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web sites.  
							<br><br><br>
							
							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">V.	SECURITY</b><br><br>
							
			The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).   <br><br>

			We have implemented and follow reasonable industry standard technical and procedural measures to protect against unauthorized access and use of your personal information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>

			If you have any questions about security on our Web sites, you can email us at privacy@horoscope.com. 
							<br><br><br>
							
							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">VI.	OTHER WEB SITES LINKS</b><br><br>

Horoscope.com has no control over, does not review, and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites.

							<br><br><br>
							
							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">VII.	UPDATING/DELETING YOUR PROFILE</b><br><br>

In some instances you may be able to update your information prior to purchasing a service from us, this may be done right on the order form.  We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.
							<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>B. Opt-out.</b>  If you have chosen to receive personalized messages, newsletters, or promotional communications by e-mail, you can at any time cancel this, or "<b>opt-out</b>", by following the instructions on your personalized Home Page or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive. Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings, we may share your e-mail address with our Third Party Contractors to ensure that you do not receive further communications from us.
							<br><br><br>
							
							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">VIII.	SERVICE-RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS</b><br><br>
							
			Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notice that we have changed the Offerings, the Terms of Service, or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it is necessary to do so. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to delete your Profile. We will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any deletion of your Profile.

							<b style="font-weight:bold;" class="fontsma5">X.	CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br><br>
							
			We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole discretion.  These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Sites or associated services.  If we make any material changes to Privacy Policy, we will notify existing users by including a notice of these changes in the newsletter that we send to our users and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Sites. The amended terms shall automatically be effective for existing users on the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days after they are initially posted on our Sites or thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of our newsletter containing notice of the changes.  If the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the newsletter described above, our dispatch of the newsletter containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the newsletter.  If you do not agree to the revised Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Site and associated services. You agree that your continued use of our Sites after notice of such amendment shall signify your acceptance of such change.
