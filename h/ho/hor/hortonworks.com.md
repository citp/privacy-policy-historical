If you ask us to delete your Personally Identifiable Information from our records, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to do so while retaining any record necessary to comply with governmental authority requirements or applicable federal, state, or local law. Even after removal, however, copies of your Personally Identifiable Information may remain viewable in cached or archived pages or if other users have copied or stored such information. If you have any questions or concerns about the Personally Identifiable Information you have submitted, you may contact us at: legal@Hortonworks.com.
