<p><b class="blue">NOTICE OF INFORMATION PRIVACY PRACTICES</b></p>

<p><b class="blue">THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.  PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</b></p>

<p><b class="blue">To Our Customers and
Potential Customers:</b></p>

<p>Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of
New Jersey and its affiliated companies * want you to know that we recognize
our obligation to keep information
about you secure and confidential.
Unlike many other financial
and health institutions, we do not sell
information about you, and we do not
share your information except to conduct
our business — <i>Making
Healthcare Work</i><sup style="font-size:8pt;">SM</sup> for you.</p>

<p>As required by law, we publish this
Notice to explain the information that
we collect and how we maintain use, 
and disclose it in administering your
benefits. We will abide by the statements made in this Notice. <i>Except as
permitted by law and as explained in
this Notice, we do not disclose any information
about our past, present, or
future customers to anyone</i>. When
we use the terms "Customer
Information," we are referring to financial
or health information that is "nonpublic,"
including any information from
which a judgment could possibly be
made about you. When we use the
terms "Protected Health Information" or
"PHI," we are referring to individually
identifiable information concerning
the provision of, or payment for,
health care to you. We refer to
Customer Information and PHI collectively
as "Private Information."</p>

<p><i><b class="blue">Members of self-funded plans</b></i><br>
If you are a participant or beneficiary
of a self-funded group health plan, we
may use and disclose your Private
Information as described in this Notice.
However, our use or disclosure is dictated
by an arrangement with your  employer or other sponsor of your benefits plan. That
plan sponsor may have additional uses
and disclosures of your Private Information
that are not accounted for here. With
respect to your individual rights, you should
ask your plan administrator how to exercise
those rights, along with any other question
or problem you may have regarding your
plan's privacy policies and practices.</p>

<p><i><b class="blue">What information do we collect?</b></i><br>
In providing your health coverage, we
collect Customer Information and PHI from
the following sources:
<i></i></p><ul><i>
<li>Information we receive from you or
your policyholder on applications or
other forms;
</li><li>Information we obtain from your
transactions with us, our affiliates, or
others, such as health care providers;
</li><li>Information we receive from consumer
reporting agencies or others, such as
state regulators and law enforcement
agencies.
</li></i></ul>
<p></p>

<p><i><b class="blue">How do we protect Private Information?</b></i><br>
Our employees understand the need to
maintain your Private Information in the
strictest confidence. They agree to be
bound by that promise of confidentiality
and are subject to disciplinary action if
they violate that promise. We also maintain
physical, electronic, and procedural
safeguards to guard your Private
Information. Finally, in those situations
when we rely on a third party to perform
business, professional, or insurance services or functions for us, that third party
must agree to protect and safeguard your
Private Information. That business
associate must also agree to use it
only as required to perform those
functions it performs for us and as
otherwise permitted by law. In these
ways, we carry out our confidentiality
commitments to you.</p>

<p><i><b class="blue">When must we seek your
authorization before disclosing
Private Information?</b></i><br>
There may be circumstances when
we will seek your authorization before
making a disclosure of your Private
Information. This is to ensure that we
have your permission to make that
disclosure. For example, you may
have asked someone who is not your
personal representative (and is not
the policyholder or certificate holder)
to contact us on your behalf to discuss
the way we have paid your claim.
Before we begin discussing your
Private Information with that person,
we would seek your authorization to
do so, unless otherwise permitted or
described in this Notice.</p>

<p>If you give us your authorization, you
are permitted to revoke that authorization
at any time in writing. We will honor
your revocation once it is processed,
except to the extent that we have
taken action in reliance upon your
original authorization.</p>

<p><i><b class="blue">Uses and disclosures of Private
Information that do not require
authorization</b></i><br>
Most of our use and disclosure of your Private Information occurs in
administering your coverage. In
those instances, we are not required
to seek your authorization. For
instance, we are generally permitted
to make disclosures of your Private
Information without authorization for
purposes of <i>treatment, payment, and
health care operations</i>. In this Notice,
we provide examples of those purposes,
although not every use or disclosure
that falls into those categories is listed.</p>

<p>Please note that we will limit the
disclosure of certain information in
accordance with laws governing the
special nature of the information (e.g.,
HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, or genetic
information). Also, where a state
permits minors of a certain age to
seek treatment without parental consent,
information that would normally be
provided to our customers may be
limited. That is because we must protect the privacy of that minor’s information in accordance with those state
laws.</p>

<p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top"><b class="blue">•</b></td><td>
<i><b class="blue">Payment Activities</b><br>
We use and disclose Private
Information in connection with your
health care coverage to determine
your eligibility for coverage and
benefits, and to see that the treatment
and services you receive are
properly billed and paid. To do this,
we may share Private Information
with health care providers, their
billing agents, insurance companies,
and others. Our payment activities
can also include the use of Private
Information for: risk adjustment, billing, claims management, collection
activities, utilization review, medical
necessity determinations, underwriting,
and other rate-setting activities.
For example, a claim for medical
services rendered to you may be
submitted from a billing service on
behalf of your provider. Our claims
processors will then use your Private
Information to process your claim.
If we need additional information to
process it, we may contact your
provider to obtain that information.
When we do that, we disclose
Private Information to your provider
in order to identify and discuss
your claim with him or her. Your
provider then discloses the needed,
additional Private Information
that will enable us to
properly process your claim.
In this example, each of these entities
involved — your provider,
his or her billing service, and
Horizon BCBSNJ and/or its affiliated
companies — is covered by and
must protect the privacy
of your Private
Information, either because they are
"covered entities" or "business
associates" of covered entities
under the federal privacy
regulations.</i>

<i><b class="blue">Health Care Operations Activities</b><br>
We use and disclose Private
Information to conduct our health
care business, including all the
activities that are defined by federal
regulation as "health care operations."
They include, but are not limited to,
case management and care coordination,
utilization review, quality assessment and improvement, network
provider credentialing, population-based research to
improve health or
reduce health care costs, and contacting
providers and members with information about treatment alternatives.
For example, we may use Private
Information to remind you about
the value of preventive care or the
availability of a disease management
program. Other health care
operations activities include use of
Private Information for compliance
and auditing activities, evaluating
provider performance, underwriting,
formulary development, information
systems management, fraud and
abuse detection (by ourselves or
for other plans or providers), facilitation
of a sale, transfer, merger, or
consolidation of all or part of
Horizon BCBSNJ and/or its affiliated
companies with another entity
(including due diligence related
to the transaction), customer service,

We may use or disclose your
Private Information for a number

are permitted to tell you about
possible treatment options or
alternatives, inform you of
health-related benefits or services,
inform you of a relevant disease
management program that may be
of interest to you, and seek your
voluntary participation in such
programs to help improve your
health and assist in the coordination
of your overall health care. For
example, our diabetes disease
management business associate
may, after reviewing PHI that we
had provided, determine that you
may suffer from diabetes. You may
then receive a notice that we have
enrolled you in our disease management
program. If you do not want further contact about, or to participate
in, the program, you only need
to notify us. Our business associate
may not use or disclose
your information further, as it
may only use that information

facilitate payment for services
under another health plan. In addition,
we are permitted to disclose PHI to
other covered entities, so that they
can conduct certain aspects of their
health care operations. We may

plan sponsor complies with certain
privacy requirements and agrees
not to use that information for
employment-related decisions;

<p>You should understand that, except
in the circumstances described in this
document, we will not disclose your
Private Information without a written
authorization from you. And except
for disclosures of PHI made directly to
you, for your treatment, or pursuant
to your authorization, federal rules
require us to use and disclose only
the minimum PHI necessary to
accomplish our purpose. For example,
if we need to disclose your PHI to our
utilization review care manager to
help determine the medical necessity
