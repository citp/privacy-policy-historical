## Our Terms and Conditions

This Policy is part of the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.hormelfoods.com/terms-conditions/) that govern your use of our Website. A link to our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.hormelfoods.com/terms-conditions/) is provided at the bottom of each page of our Website.

## Children Under the Age of 13

Our Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not provide any information on this Website.

## Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It

We collect several types of information from and about users of our Website. Some of the information we collect may be “personal information,” which means it identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. The information we collect falls into the following categories:

  * Information that you manually provide to us, for example, when completing a registration or contest-entry form, requesting services, or posting “User Contributions” (content you post using the social networking tools we make available to you).
  * Information from third-party social media platforms. You may be able to register with, log on to, or enhance your profile on our Website by choosing to automatically populate the requested data fields with information you previously provided to a third-party social media platform (such as Facebook or Twitter). By doing this, you are asking the third-party platform to send us information, including personal information, from your profile on that platform. We treat that information as we do any other information you give to us when you register, log on, or enhance your profile.
  * Information from your browser or device, such as your IP address and other information about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our Website, and usage details.
  * Information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies. Cookies help us understand the types of products you’re interested in and how you use our Website. They also support the features and functionality of our Website—for example, by saving you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to use or access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website.



Please note that information we receive from your web browser or device or that is collected by cookies is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable. However, we may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you.

## Third-party Advertiser Use of Cookies.

In addition to the cookies Company delivers to your computer through our Website, certain third parties may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Website. To learn more about Google Analytics, click here.

Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors over time and across nonaffiliated websites and/or delivering targeted advertisements either on our Website or on other websites.

You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our Website. For example, if you don’t want information about your visit to our Website sent to Google Analytics, you may download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. Please note that the Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to Company.

In addition, if you would like to opt-out of having interest-based information collected by certain entities during your visits to our Website or other websites, please click here. You will be directed to an industry-developed website that contains mechanisms for choosing whether each listed entity may collect and use data for online behavioral advertising purposes. It may be that some of the third parties that collect interest-based information on this Site do not participate in the industry-developed opt-out website, in which case the best way to avoid third-party tracking of your online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies. Please note that the opt-out is device specific. If you wish to opt-out from having interest-based information collected by participating entities across all devices, you need take the steps outlined above from each device.

## Disclosure of Your Information

With regard to aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, we reserve the right to disclose such information without restriction.

With regard to User Contributions, including those that contain personal information, we reserve the right to disclose such information without restriction. In particular, please note that User Contributions, by definition, can be read, collected, used, and further disclosed by other users of our Website. We also reserve the right to use User Contributions you submit for advertising campaigns and other promotions. We may or may not use your name in connection with such use, and we may or may not seek your further consent before using the content for such purposes. Therefore, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to User Contributions you submit on or through our Website.

With regard to all other personal information, we reserve the right to disclose it to the following entities:

  * Among members of the Hormel corporate family, including our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. These entities are permitted to use your personal information in any manner consistent with this policy.
  * To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business.
  * To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Hormel Foods’ assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Hormel Foods about our Website users is among the assets transferred.
  * To third parties to market their products or services to you if you have not opted out of such disclosure.
  * To anyone to whom disclosure is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which you provide personal information. For example, if you give us an e-mail address to use the “e-mail a friend” feature of our Website, we will transmit the contents of that e-mail and your e-mail address to the recipients.
  * For any other purpose either disclosed by us when you provide the information or for which we have your consent.



We may also disclose your personal information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Hormel Foods, our customers or others.

## Choices Regarding Your Information

In General. We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose your information. This Policy describes some of your choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving “cookies” and your right to opt out of having your information shared with third parties for their own marketing purposes. We may ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your information.

Email preferences. You can opt out of promotional emails we send you. If you wish to stop receiving promotional emails, simply select “unsubscribe” located at the bottom of each communication. Please note that you cannot opt out of transactional emails, such as emails confirming a purchase made on our Website.

Do Not Track Mechanisms. California law requires this Policy to address how we respond to any “Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) signal” delivered by your browser. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.

Previously Expressed Preferences. You may be able to change previously expressed preferences regarding how we use your information. To do so, please contact us using the information provided below.

We encourage you to choose your privacy settings on those sites accordingly.

## Data Security
