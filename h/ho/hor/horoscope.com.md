This is our way of notifying you about free readings, special gift offers, new reports or feature updates. You can easily unsubscribe from these at any time.

You can rest assured that Horoscope.com will never share email addresses with anyone else. If you decide at any time that you want to stop receiving our special notifications, you can opt-out by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the end of every email or by visiting the "Newsletter" area of the website.

If you are subscribed to our newsletter, we may also send out special offer emails on behalf of select partners and advertisers that we feel are of interest to our members. Each of these mailings will provide you with an easy way to unsubscribe. They will come from Horoscope.com on behalf of these select third-parties -- we will never share or sell your email address or private information with anyone.
