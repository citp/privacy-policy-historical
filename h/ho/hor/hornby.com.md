We collect the following general data that is not personally identifiable information pertaining to site traffic. We collect this information through click stream tracking and automatic logging files. This general information is collected automatically and is not connected to specific user data. 

We may employ the use of cookies. A cookie is a small text file that our Web server places on a user’s computer hard drive to be a unique identifier. Cookies enable Hornby America to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to users. Our cookies usually have an expiration date.

**Part II. Information Usage**

The information collected by Hornby America will be used for internal use. Users who provide information may receive email announcements or updates concerning our products or services.

Registered users may receive additional announcements from us about products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications by contacting us directly.

The information we collect will not be used to create customer profiles based on browsing or purchasing history. We will not supplement information collected at our Web site with data from other sources such as credit history to authorize purchases.

We will share data with our transaction gateway only for the purposes of authorizing your purchase. We may have links to other sites from ours. Please note: When you click on links to other Web sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours.
