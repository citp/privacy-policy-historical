<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>Background<br>
</strong>Hockey Canada is the sole governing body for amateur hockey in Canada. In co-operation with thirteen Branch associations, the Canadian Hockey League and Canadian Inter-University Sport, Hockey Canada operates Hockey Programming across Canada. Hockey Programming means making all arrangements for amateur hockey leagues, teams and games including choosing and training coaches and referees, deciding which players may participate at which level, establishing appropriate rules and regulations for amateur hockey. As part of their Hockey Programming activities, Hockey Canada and its aforementioned partners also take responsibility for determining if transfer regulations may apply, scouting, gauging the success of certain programs in order that might improve upon them, facilitating emergency contact, providing educational opportunities, career opportunities, research and to maintaining regular electronic updates/contact with participants.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>Purpose of this Policy</strong><br>
Hockey Canada has developed this Privacy Policy for implementation beginning January 1, 2004. This Policy describes the way that Hockey Canada collects, uses, retains, safeguards, discloses and disposes of the personal information of prospective members, members, and others including players, coaches, referees, managers and volunteers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000">This Policy describes the way that Hockey Canada will, subject to applicable legal requirements, adhere to all relevant federal and provincial legislative privacy requirements. The Policy follows the 10 Canadian Standards Association (CSA) principles identified in the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). The Policy describes each principle and the method of implementing each. Hockey Canada will strive to meet or exceed federal and provincial legislative requirements and will ensure that it remains current with changing technologies and laws. Any and all changes will immediately be posted to the Hockey Canada web site.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>1.</strong></font> <font color="#CC0000"><strong>Accountability</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>1.1</strong> Hockey Canada will appoint a staff person (the "Privacy Officer") whose responsibilities will include those of the implementation and monitoring of the Hockey Canada Privacy Policy. The Privacy Officer will be responsible for Hockey Canada’s compliance with privacy principles. This person will also be responsible for responding to access requests in accordance with this Policy. The Privacy Officer will report to the President and the ultimate responsibility for Privacy issues will rest with the Hockey Canada Board of Directors. The Privacy Officer may at his/her discretion enlist assistance from other staff members and/or volunteers within the organization. This will not in any manner mitigate his/her responsibility for Privacy issues.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>1.2</strong> The Privacy Officer’s identity will be fully disclosed and publicly accessible to Hockey Canada members and the public in general. Hockey Canada’s Privacy Officer is Glen McCurdie and can be reached at <a href="mailto:gmccurdie@hockeycanada.ca">gmccurdie@hockeycanada.ca</a>, or by phone at 613-562-5677, extension #2314.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>1.3</strong> Hockey Canada’s Privacy Officer will ensure that Hockey Canada manages all personal information in its possession in accordance with this Policy including that which may be transferred to a third party. Third party organizations who handle information on behalf of Hockey Canada shall be contractually obligated to adhere to the standards of Hockey Canada.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>1.4</strong> Hockey Canada will implement internal policies which will facilitate adherence to this Privacy Policy including but not limited to the following:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Security measures at all levels designed to protect personal information in our possession.<br>
• Implementing procedures designed to respond to complaints and/or inquiries.<br>
• Staff training in all facets of information management, including awareness of Hockey Canada’s Privacy Policy and policies and procedures developed in accordance with the Policy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>2.</strong></font> <font color="#CC0000"><strong>Identifying Purposes, Type of Information Collected and Website</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>2.1</strong> Hockey Canada shall only collect the information reasonably necessary to conduct Hockey Programming. Access to our Privacy policies and procedures will be readily available. Similarly, the process by which challenges may be made to Hockey Canada’s compliance and/or adherence to the legislation in question shall be readily available and transparent. To obtain further information, contact Hockey Canada’s Privacy Officer. Hockey Canada’s Privacy Officer is Glen McCurdie and can be reached at <a href="mailto:gmccurdie@hockeycanada.ca">gmccurdie@hockeycanada.ca</a>, or by phone at 613-562-5677, extension #2314.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>2.2</strong> Hockey Canada collects personal information from prospective members, members, coaches, referees, managers and volunteers for the purposes of conducting Hockey Programming. Specifically:<br>
• A player’s name, address and date of birth are collected to determine that the player’s geographical, division of play and level of play information are consistent with Hockey Canada/Branch regulations.<br>
• Historical information concerning past teams played for is collected in order to determine if any Hockey Canada transfer regulations may apply.<br>
• Information concerning an individual’s skill level and development and feedback on programs is collected to measure the success of our programs in order that we may better plan future programs.<br>

• Educational information may be collected in order to ensure all Hockey Canada residency regulations have been adhered to.<br>
• E-mail addresses may be collected for the purposes of facilitating membership communication related to upcoming events and programs.<br>

• Personal information collected for the purposes of hockey registrations may also be used for hockey specific research purposes including but not necessarily limited to hockey demographic type research.<br>
• Affiliates. Hockey Canada has numerous organizations which offer hockey programs under the auspices of Hockey Canada. These include the Canadian Hockey League, Canadian Inter-University Sport and provincial and local Branches, associations, and leagues. Hockey Canada discloses the personal information described in paragraph 2.2 to all of these organizations in order to facilitate Hockey Programming and ensure compliance with rules and regulations.<br>
• Potential and actual insurance claims and the subsequent investigation thereof.<br>
• Appeals and regulations challenges as well as information collected to defend Hockey Canada against legal action brought against Hockey Canada.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>2.3</strong> Hockey Canada will endeavour through its member Branches, associations/leagues to advise potential registration candidates of the purpose for the collection of the data requested at the time of registration or by reference to our web site at www.hockeycanada.ca. We will further endeavour to ensure that all collectors of the personal information are familiar with the potential use of the personal data. All personal data collected by Hockey Canada shall be maintained in either of its two offices or its four Centres of Excellence offices all of which are listed on our web site.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>2.4</strong> Hockey Canada will request individually permission for the use of any personal data collected which is extraneous to that which has been identified above, unless said usage is authorized by law.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>2.5</strong> Hockey Canada may also use information about an individual who accesses secure areas of www.hockeycanada.ca. Information you are asked to provide during your use of our web site may include your name, address, e-mail address, age, sex [and the other types of personal information listed in paragraph 2.2]. All such personal information will be treated within the same parameters as other personal information collected by Hockey Canada through other means. It is always your choice to provide information in certain fields although failure to complete certain sections may inhibit your ability to fully access all areas of the web site. Our web site also collects non-identifiable information about users such as the users IP address, the sections of the web site visited and the information downloaded. Hockey Canada may use this non-identifiable information and disclose it to service providers, for system administration purposes and to improve the web site.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>3.</strong></font> <font color="#CC0000"><strong>Consent</strong></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>3.3</strong> Hockey Canada recognizes that hockey by its nature is a contact sport and injuries are to a certain extent inherent in the game. We believe medical records, medical history and medical forms of the individual may be of assistance in an emergency situation and therefore we may request them. While our members and prospective members are under no obligation whatsoever to supply this information and may refuse to do so without penalty, Hockey Canada will consider receipt of this information as consent for its subsequent use in an emergency medical situation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><strong>3.4</strong> If at any time you wish to withdraw your consent to the use of your information for any purposes, you may do so by contacting the Privacy Officer for Hockey Canada.
