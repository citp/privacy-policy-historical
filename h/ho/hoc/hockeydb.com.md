# Privacy Policy at the Internet Hockey Database

The Internet Hockey Database maintains a full commitment to your privacy. No personally identifying information is ever gathered on anyone visiting this site, with the exception of optional information on the discussion forums. The information given there is never used for any purposes other than the discussion forums.

You may choose to post anonymously on the discussion forums. You do not have to give your e-mail, and if you do choose to give it, you can shield others from seeing it. Although e-mail addresses are stored, we do not harvest any e-mail addresses from the forum, and we will **never** make your e-mail available to any third party.

Hockeydb does not perform mass-mailings to its forum members. The only time you may receive e-mail from Hockeydb.com is when you elect to receive notification of a response to your forum topic. Such an election is opt-in -- you must actively check the box that allows an e-mail reminder to be sent to you.

From time to time cookies may be written to your computer. A cookie is simply a unique number placed on your hard drive that lets us know if you have previously been to the site. Most commercial sites such as Microsoft.com use cookies. There is no way to gather any information about you from this cookie other than knowing if you have visited the site in the past.

Hockeydb.com writes cookies under three circumstances.

  * A general cookie is written/updated for each page you visit the site. This is to count the number of pages viewed, and track the number of times you visit so that we can better understand how people use the site. Since you never give hockeydb.com any personal information this data cannot be linked to you in any way.
  * A cookie is written when you view the forum software, Ultimate Bulletin Board. This is a canned package which uses cookies to keep track of your user ID on your computer, and to tell you which messages are new to you. It is not related to the cookie discussed above.
  * Hockeydb.com is only able to survive because of the advertising revenue it receives. Several of the banner advertising companies use cookies to track the number of ads you see, limiting you to seeing a certain number of ads per session. 



We have contracted with ValueClick and other advertising networks to monitor certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our website. Where authorized by us, ValueClick may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors. No personally identifiable information is collected by or transferred to any party other than the Advertiser. For more information about how the information is collected and used by ValueClick, please see ValueClick's privacy policy at [ http://media.valueclick.com/privacy_consumer.shtml](http://media.valueclick.com/privacy_consumer.shtml).
