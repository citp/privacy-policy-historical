## 4    Collecting personal data when you visit our website

When simply using the website for informational purposes, i.e., if you don’t register or send us information in another way, we only collect personal data that your browser sends to our server. If you want to view our website, we collect the following data that are required for technical reasons in order for us to display our website and guarantee its stability and safety. The legal basis for this is Article 6 Paragraph 1 f of the GDPR:

When you contact us by e-mail or via the contact form, we store data you have shared to respond to your question or issue.

This information is used to clearly define your request and to improve how your concern is processed. This information is explicitly provided on a voluntary basis and with your consent; Article 6 Paragraph 1 a of the GDPR. If this information relates to channels of communication (for example, e-mail address, phone number), you are also agreeing that we may contact you via these channels of communication where necessary in order to respond to your concern.

We delete such data when they no longer need to be saved, or we restrict their processing if legal retention periods apply.

## 6    Newsletter

#### 6.1    General information

You can subscribe to our newsletter, through which we send you information about our current offers, by providing your consent in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 a of the GDPR.   
We use a "double opt-in process" when you register for our newsletter. This means that once you have registered your e-mail address, we send you a confirmation e-mail to that e-mail address in which we ask you to confirm that you want us to send newsletters. If you do not confirm registration within 24 hours, your information will be locked and automatically deleted after a month .

We also save the IP addresses you use and the time of registration and confirmation. The purpose of this process is to provide evidence of your registration and to be able to clarify any potential misuse of your personal data, where necessary.

We only require an e-mail address to send newsletters. Once you have confirmed your registration, we save your e-mail address for the purpose of sending newsletters. The legal basis for this is Article 6 Paragraph 1 a of the GDPR.

You do of course have the option of unsubscribing from the newsletter at any time, and withdrawing the consent given with future effect. In order to do so, please click on the unsubscribe button in the newsletter received. 

#### 6.2    Newsletter tracking 

We wish to point out that we evaluate your user behavior when sending out newsletters. For the purpose of this evaluation, the e-mails sent include "web beacons", also known as "tracking pixels", which are saved on our website. For evaluations, we link the specified data and the web beacons to your e-mail address and an individual ID.

We create a user profile using the data recorded so that we can tailor the newsletter to your individual interests. In doing so, we record when you read our newsletters and which links in them you click on, and from this we draw conclusions about your personal interests. We link this data with actions you carry out on our website. 

You can object to this tracking at any time by clicking on the separate link provided in every e-mail. Information is only saved if you have subscribed to newsletters. Once you unsubscribe, we only save data in a purely statistical and anonymous way. 

This kind of tracking is also impossible if you have deactivated images in your e-mail program as the default setting. In this case, however, the newsletter will not be fully displayed and you may not be able to use all of the functions. If you activate the images manually, the tracking described above will take place.

The legal basis for this is Article 6 Paragraph 1 a, b and f of the GDPR.

## 8    Online orders - Shop

The legal basis for this is the conclusion and execution of a contract based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 b of the GDPR. Data are stored for the duration of the contract and in accordance with legal obligations. We use a number of payment service providers to process payments, which are always specified and directly accept your input, and are therefore the recipients of your personal data collected in connection with the payment process.
