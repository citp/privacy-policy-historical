<h1>COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY </h1>
<p>This site is owned and operated by Comfort Software Group (CSG). Your privacy on 
  the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At CSG, we 
  want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.</p>
<p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users, 
  we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding 
  the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement 
  discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
<p><b>INFORMATION CSG GATHERS AND TRACKS</b></p>
<p>CSG gathers two types of information about users:</p>
<p>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. 
  These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, 
  to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, 
  and from participation in polls and surveys:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Information CSG gathers through aggregated tracking information 
  derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This 
  information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs 
  and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics 
  of our audience. Because CSG derives its revenue mainly from 
  sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic 
  data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no 
  circumstances does CSG divulge any information about an individual 
  user to a third party. </p>
<p>CSG Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
<p>Optional Voluntary Information</p>
<p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of 
  voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p>
<p>1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)</p>
<p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. CSG 
  gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. 
  Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following 
  the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription 
  management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at 
  the time of registration.</p>
<p>2. Message boards/forums</p>
<p>Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately 
  for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, 
  although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration 
  the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.</p>
<p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service</p>
<p>Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, 
  or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a 
  friend". The user must provide their email address, as well 
  as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case 
  of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know 
  who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>4. Polling</p>
<p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share 
  their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks 
  about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are 
  aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. CSG 
  may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, 
  so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is 
  not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
<p>5. Surveys</p>
<p>CSG may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target 
  our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic 
  information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and 
  partners. We never share any of this information about specific 
  individuals with any third party.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
  Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally 
  identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without 
  requesting parental consent.</p>
<p>Usage tracking</p>
<p>CSG tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. 
  However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual 
  users. CSG does break down overall usage statistics according 
  to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading 
  this information from the browser string (information contained 
  in every user's browser).</p>
<p>CSG sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that 
  users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated 
  with individual users. We use tracking information to determine 
  which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic 
  to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but 
  rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue 
  to build a better service for you.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser 
  files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal 
  Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this 
  site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. 
  But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information 
  you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk 
  or read cookie files created by other sites. CSG uses cookies 
  to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising 
  system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions 
  and click rates.</p>
<p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If 
  you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you 
  will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need 
  to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need 
  cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling 
  and surveys.</p>
<p><b>USE OF INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>CSG uses any information voluntarily given by our users 
  to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to 
  provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to 
  better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.</p>
<p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide 
  in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users 
  to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We 
  send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending 
  on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when 
  we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something 
  we are doing. CSG never shares newsletter mailing lists with 
  any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.</p>
<p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our 
  sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. 
  We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well 
  each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better 
  service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function 
  as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't 
  track which terms a particular user enters.</p>
<p><b>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>CSG uses the above-described information to tailor our content 
  to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our 
  audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service 
  free. We will not share information about individual users with 
  any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal 
  process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
<p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
<p>CSG operates secure data networks protected by industry 
  standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security 
  and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary 
  and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided 
  by our customers.</p>
<p><b>OPT-OUT POLICY</b></p>
<p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices 
  include:</p>
<p>Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely 
  alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information 
  from our users </p>
<p><b>YOUR CONSENT</b></p>
<p>
  By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this 
  information by CSG. If we decide to change our privacy policy, 
  we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware 
  of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances 
  we disclose it.</p>
