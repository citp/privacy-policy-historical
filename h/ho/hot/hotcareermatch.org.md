1.2 Site Membership or Registration. To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from **_Hotcareermatch.org_** , this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from **_Hotcareermatch.org_** , whether at our Website or otherwise. We collect information in certain portions of our Website, which may include your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, education, occupation, employment information, and such other information as may be requested from time to time or where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal profile information you submit to **_Hotcareermatch.org_** remains your property, but by submitting that information to **_Hotcareermatch.org_** , you grant **_Hotcareermatch.org_** , the right to use that information for marketing purposes. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** , may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event **_Hotcareermatch.org_** believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of its AUP the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if **_Hotcareermatch.org_** is sold or acquired, or when **_Hotcareermatch.org_** deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when **_Hotcareermatch.org_** , in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate. 

"Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's services, via registration at our website. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use. Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name, email address, postal address, birth date, telephone number, interests, user behavior and other demographic information. This information enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers' needs and to help our clients to promote and sell their products and services. 

1.3 Requests for Assistance or Service. Other occasions when **_Hotcareermatch.org_** obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual requests assistance through **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's customer service department, and (2) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, **_Hotcareermatch.org_** may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows **_Hotcareermatch.org_** to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's database. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites. 

(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an <img src="x"> programming function -- see [http://truste.org](http://truste.org/) for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows **_Hotcareermatch.org_** to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, **_Hotcareermatch.org_** might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's database, visits the cosmetic website, **_Hotcareermatch.org_** receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and **_Hotcareermatch.org_** would then update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is interested in cosmetics. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, **_Hotcareermatch.org_** also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's database. 

(c) New TechnologyThe use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, **_Hotcareermatch.org_** strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology. 

(d) Usage Tracking and Log Files. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites. Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage. 

(e) Optional Registration. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers. During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information. This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in **_Hotcareermatch.org_** services. 

(f) Feedback and Inquiries. You have the ability to contact **_Hotcareermatch.org_** to provide us with their feedback. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues. 

(g) IP Address. We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer this Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data. 

(h) Clear GIFs. We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user PII. 

1.5 Outside Information. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of **_Hotcareermatch.org_** including information located in public databases ("Outside Information"). 

1.6 No Information Collected from Children. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If **_Hotcareermatch.org_** obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, **_Hotcareermatch.org_** has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** is designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). 

1.7 Links to External Websites. **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's emails and websites contain links to external websites. You will be taken to external websites if you click on these links. Your information may be passed from **_Hotcareermatch.org_** 's database to the external website, and/or external database, for your convenience (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website). **_Hotcareermatch.org_** is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any external website owner.
