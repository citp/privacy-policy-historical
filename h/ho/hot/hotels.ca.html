This privacy statement covers the site hotels.ca. Your privacy is 
important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet enjoyable and 
to foster your trust in eCommerce as a whole. Because we want to demonstrate our 
commitment to our users' privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information 
practices. 
<p></p>This Privacy policy is an integral part of our website and the services 
offered to you and cannot, in any way, be separated from the User Agreement or 
from the membership, usage or transaction process. If you do not agree to our 
privacy policy in whole, you must not use our website. 
<p></p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact our <a class="all_links" href="/hotel-htdocs/ca/hotels.ca/GeneralHelpAndComments.htm">Customer Care team</a>.
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level2">Information Collected Online About You</span> 
<p></p><span class="content-header-level3">Information that you provide us:</span> 
<p></p><span class="content-header-level3">Member Registration</span><br>
When you become a hotels.ca member you provide your name, address, 
telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and 
password validation. This information is collected on the registration form for 
several reasons including: (1) personal identification; (2) to complete hotel, 
air and car reservations; (3) to allow us to contact you for customer service, 
if necessary; (4) to customize the content of our site to meet your specific 
needs; and (5) to make product improvements to hotels.ca. In addition, your 
e-mail address is collected to send you an e-mail message confirming your new 
member registration and each reservation you transact online. If you provide a 
fax number, you may receive faxes confirming your new member registration and 
each reservation that you transact online as well. As a member you will 
occasionally receive updates from us about special offers, new hotels.ca services, and other 
noteworthy news items. However, you may always decline to receive these e-mail 
and fax messages. Please see our Opt Out policy described below. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Member Profile</span><br>
Members can choose to provide hotels.ca with travel 
preferences, credit card billing information, and other personal information. 
This information is primarily used to assist members in making reservations 
quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Reservation Orders</span><br>
When you book a reservation through our site, we ask you to provide 
personally identifiable information by filling out and submitting an online 
customer profile form if you are not a hotels.ca member already. This 
information includes your name, home or work telephone number, fax number, e-mail 
address, and your credit card number, expiration date and billing address. We 
use this information to process and book your reservation and to notify you of 
your reservation status by e-mail or fax. When you return to the site and if you 
use your name and provide other key, personally identifiable information, we use 
this information to provide you with access to your reservation information. 
<p></p>We also ask you for personally identifiable information about other 
people for whom you are booking reservations. We use this information only to 
reserve the room with the hotel or other lodging, and, if you request it, to 
send each person an e-mail notification of the reservation. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level2">Information Use</span>
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Cookies</span><br>
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer tied to 
information about you. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. 
For the session ID cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie simply 
terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive 
for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following 
the Web browser help file directions. 
<p></p>hotels.ca uses cookies in several ways. We use cookies to allow you to 
login without having to type your login name each time. Instead, only your 
password is needed to access the system. We also use cookies to track usage of 
the Guest path and to serve advertisements through our advertising networks. 
Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit 
your browser options to block them in the future. If you reject the cookie, you 
may still use our website. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited 
in some areas of our website. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target 
the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. See Member 
Profile. 
<p></p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, 
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once 
we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy 
statement covers the use of cookies by hotels.ca only and does not cover 
the use of cookies by any advertisers. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Log Files</span><br>
Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes 
internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), 
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to 
analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, 
diagnose problems with our servers and gather broad demographic information for 
aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable 
information. We use a tracking utility called ATG Dynamo that uses log files to 
analyze user movement. 
<p></p>Please be aware that we have links on our site that may collect 
personally identifiable information about you. This privacy policy does not 
cover the information practices or policies of such websites. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level2">Communications from the Site</span> 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Special Offers and Updates</span><br>
We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and 
username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our 
users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. (Please 
see the Choice/Opt-out section below). 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Newsletter</span><br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact 
information such as name and e-mail address. Out of respect for our users privacy 
we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. (Please see the Choice/Opt-out section below). 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Service Announcements</span><br>
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related 
announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for 
maintenance we might send users an e-mail. Generally, users may not opt-out of 
these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these 
communications are not promotional in nature. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Customer Service</span><br>
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested 
services and in regards to issues relating to their account.  We reply via e-mail, 
fax or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level2">Sharing</span>
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Legal Disclaimer</span><br>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, hotels.ca may be required by law 
to disclose information you have provided in obtaining our travel products or 
services. hotels.ca may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to hotels.ca's interests (such as 
customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</span><br>
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and 
advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Third Party Intermediaries</span><br>
We use an outside a credit card processing company and bank cheque 
processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not 
retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any 
secondary purposes. Hotels.ca is using a third-party 
service, WebSideStory, to collect aggregate information about Web site usage. 
Please see http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/ for information about 
WebSideStory and their commitment to your privacy.
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Suppliers</span><br>
We provide information about travel either reserved or purchased on hotels.ca to the suppliers whose 
will fulfill your travel reservation. Although hotels.ca offers travel products 
from hotel, airline and car rental suppliers that are reputable companies, we 
have not placed limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your 
information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the 
information privacy practices of any travel suppliers whose products you 
purchase on hotels.ca. In addition, these 
travel suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional 
information about your confirmed reservation. 
<p></p>Hotels.ca will occasionally share 
aggregated information with our service providers. This information does not 
contain any personally identifiable information and is used to develop featured 
programs and content that will be of interest to our members and website 
visitors. 
<p></p>Hotels.ca may contract a reputable third-party to facilitate the distribution of survey, promotion, or 
sweepstakes programs. Upon completion of these projects, all information is 
returned to hotels.ca. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Affiliated Websites</span><br>
If you were referred to hotels.ca from another website, we may 
personally indentifiable information about you to the referring website. 
Although hotels.ca believes that the 
website companies from which you were referred to us are reputable companies, we 
have not placed limitations on the referring websites companies from using or 
disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you 
to review the information privacy practices of any website that referred you to 
hotels.ca. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Choice/Opt-out</span><br>
Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their 
information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point 
where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an opt-out 
mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing 
material, can keep their e-mail address and fax number off of our lists. 
<p></p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional 
communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying with unsubscribe 
in the subject line, or by contacting our <a class="all_links" href="/hotel-htdocs/ca/hotels.ca/GeneralHelpAndComments.htm">Customer Care team</a>. We also offer an opt-out mechanism on the member profile page. 
<p></p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being 
collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed 
choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an 
outside party. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Links</span><br>
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, 
Hotel Discounts, L.P., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to 
read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally 
identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
collected by this website. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Surveys and Contests</span><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or 
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and 
the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The 
requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and 
shipping address), and demographic information (such as your postal code). Contact 
information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey 
information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and 
satisfaction of this website. Users' personally identifiable information is not 
shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may 
use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' 
personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Security</span><br>
Hotels.ca takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via 
the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. 
<p></p>When our reservation order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
(such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected 
with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, 
such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as 
Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to 
un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing. 
<p></p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we 
also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our 
users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a 
specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service 
representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 
Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy 
practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or 
reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to 
ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store 
personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked 
facility. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level2">Supplementation of Information</span> 
<p></p>In order for this web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it 
is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information 
from third party sources. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</span><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information (such as postal code, phone, 
e-mail or postal address) changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we 
provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate the user's personally 
identifiable information. Members can change their personal information on the 
member profile page of our website. Members and users can all e-mail our <a class="all_links" href="/hotel-htdocs/ca/hotels.ca/GeneralHelpAndComments.htm">Customer Care</a> team or by contact us 
by telephone or postal mail using the contact information below. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Notification of Changes</span><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to 
this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so 
our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and 
under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in 
accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 
<p></p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable 
information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we 
will notify users via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we 
use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out 
of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then 
they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this 
new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy 
practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we 
will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In 
some cases where we post a notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to 
receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy 
practices. 
<p></p>
<span class="content-header-level3">Contact Information</span><br>
