**The Internet, Privacy and Hot Topic Online** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
The Internet contains a massive amount of information. Unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. Also, when you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you - without your knowledge.   
  
Hot Topic Online's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so.

  With your permission, the personal information you give us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest.

  Hot Topic Online also occasionally shares other information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we will say Hot Topic Online's audience is x percent females, and x percent males. This data is used to customize Hot Topic Online content for our users.

  There are cases where Hot Topic Online may ask you for personal information such as your name or address. We do this when you register for membership or contests/promotions or services that require registration or subscription or when you place an order.

  Hot Topic Online needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. When we intend to use personal information, we will tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. For example, we may want to post the names of contest winner's on our site or send you materials via e-mail or regular mail at your request. In case any personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you gave us.

**Links to other sites**  
Users should be aware that when you are on Hot Topic Online, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Hot Topic Online pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, or a link, the "click" takes you off the Hot Topic Online site. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware where you end up! 

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online-for example, via message boards - that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While Hot Topic Online strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. 

Hot Topic Online's policy does not extend to anything inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Hot Topic's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. 

We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
