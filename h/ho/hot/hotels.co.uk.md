This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Hotels.com U.K. site. Surveys & Contests  From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as postal code).

Security Hotels.com takes every precaution to protect our user's information. When users submit personal information via the Hotels.com U.K. site, their information is protected both online and off-line. How?  
Hotels.com encrypts (process of converting messages or data into a form that cannot be read without decrypting or deciphering it) the data sent over the internet with SSL (Secure Socket Layer).  
During the reservation process you will be asked to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected via SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom right of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, meaning the transaction is secure. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to PII. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our user's information is protected. Finally, the servers that store PII are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.   
If users have any questions about the security at our website, users can send an email to Customer Care. Supply of information In order for the Hotels.com U.K. site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third party sources. Personal Information When completing your reservation process, you will be required to supply your personal identifiable information to process the payment. Please make sure this information is correct, otherwise we will be unable to confirm your reservation. Notification of changes in the privacy statement If we decide to change our privacy statement , we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy statement under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use user's PII in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Hotels.com U.K. site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. Contact Information
