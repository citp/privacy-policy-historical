We may also collect your personal information from others who make a booking on your behalf.

We collect your personal information if you submit a review on our Website. In doing so, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected or used by other users. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in reviews and such disclosure of personal information by you is strictly voluntary.

We also deliver advertisements and provide website analytics tools on non-HotelClub websites and services, and we collect information such as page views on these third party sites as well.

When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mails from HotelClub, we may use customised links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you with more focused e-mail communications or other information.

**Use of Aggregated Information and Session Data**

We also use aggregated information (which is information recorded in any form about more than one individual) where the identity of the individual is not known and cannot be inferred from the information. We may use aggregated information to describe our User base to current or potential partners, investors and advertisers; after a survey, to understand and respond to market needs and preferences; or to make recommendations to other Users of our Website. For example, if Users of our Website who have travelled to a particular destination told us that they had positive experiences at a hotel in that destination, we might recommend that hotel.

We work with third parties to serve ads on our Website and to serve ads on sites owned or operated by other companies. Our ad servers, and those of our partners, use Cookies and Pixel Tags in order to anonymously identify your browser. Some third-party ad companies, such as ad networks, may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with activity on our Website with information obtained from other sources and/or sites. We do not use or share any personal information with any of our ad server partners, media partners or ad networks without your authorization.

We use anonymous Session Data, such as the destination of your search, in order to advertise to you on our Website and on other websites. We do not sell your Session Data to any other party in connection with our ad programs but we may use it in order to run ads on behalf of others, such as travel suppliers. For example, we may serve a hotel’s ad to you while you are on another site, on behalf of that hotel. In such cases, we use third parties to anonymously identify your browser while on another website. You can opt-out of this kind of advertising by clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). By opting out of this kind of advertising you may still receive ads from HotelClub or ads from other parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).

  * to suppliers of our Products or Services, such as hotels and accommodation service providers;

We will share with these companies only that personal information which they need to work on our behalf.
  * to collaborate with other companies to offer you additional Products or Services, for example, through promotions. If you request these Products and Services, we will share personal information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your personal information by these other companies.
