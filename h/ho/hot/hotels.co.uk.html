    We understand that booking online involves significant trust on your part. We value your trust, and make it a high priority to ensure the security
    and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. Please read this policy to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting this

    </ul>

    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">What information we collect from you</span></strong><br>
    <u>In General</u>. We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can
    identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses and billing information
    (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We may also request information about your hotel room preferences, and
    frequent flyer and car rental program information. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general most of the information we
    request from you is required in order for you reserve a hotel, register as a member; book travel; complete a traveler profile; participate in a
    survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our site.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Travel Companion Information</u>. When you make a reservation for someone else through this website, we will request personal information and
    travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information
    and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Information from Other Sources</u>. We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated
    entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may
    receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and demographic information.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Automatic Information</u>. We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit this website. For example, we will
    collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring website. We also may collect
    information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and bookings made. Our goals in collecting this automatic information include helping
    customize your user experience and inhibiting fraud. For more information, please see <u>Cookies and other technologies.</u><br>
    <br>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">How we use your information</span></strong> <br>
    We use sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the hotel
    reservations you make on our site. We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and
    services you request; to provide you with your hotel booking confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and
    providing travel notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve
    our products, services, and website; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise
    customize your experience with this website; to reward you as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit
    information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or
    illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Email Communications</u>. We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website. One way we do this
    is by sending you email messages that contain information about your hotel related interests. For example, if you search for a hotel in New York
    on our website but choose not to book a hotel, we may send you an email message telling you about our special deals for hotels in New York. We
    believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our site. Please note
    that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.<br>
    <br>
    Please review <u>"Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information"</u> below.<br>
    <br>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">With whom we share your information</span></strong><br>
    This website may share your information with the following entities:<br>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li><u>Suppliers</u> such as hotel, airline, car rental, and activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout this
      site, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of
      your personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through
      this site. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel
      reservation, or respond to a review you may submit. While we may share anonymous reviews with our hotel suppliers, we will not share reviewer
      names or contact information unless you have explicitly told us that we may. We are not responsible for the hotel deducing your identity from
      the content of your review and contacting you directly.</li>

      <li><u>Third-party vendors</u> who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics,
      customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to
      collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising
      tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not
      permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose. They are also required to follow the same data security practices that we
      ourselves adhere to.</li>

      <li><u>Business partners</u> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our
      website. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or
      with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those
      partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.</li>

      <li><u>Referring websites</u>. If you were referred to this website from another site (for example, through a link you clicked on another
      site that directed you to this one), we may share some information about you with that referring website. We have not placed limitations on the
      referring websites' use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you here.</li>

      <li><u>Companies within our corporate family</u>. We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies within the Expedia,
      Inc. family, listed at <a href="javascript:submitLink(" "http:="" businesses.expediainc.com="" phoenix.zhtml?c="190013&amp;p=businesses&quot;)">
      http://businesses.expediainc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=190013&amp;p=businesses</a>. This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products
      and services, both travel-related and other, which we believe might interest you. To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates
      have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity
      in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.</li>
    </ul>

    We also may share your information:<br>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal
      claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>

      <li>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect
      and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service
      and other agreements.</li>

      <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of
      bankruptcy.</li>
    </ul>
    Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an
    opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.<br>
    <br>
    We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our
    advertisers the number of visitors our website receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations. This information does not contain
    any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.<br>
    <br>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">How you can access your information</span></strong><br>
    You can access and update your contact information by visiting this website's Account section. You can close your account by contacting us at the
    email address listed below. Please note that after you close an account, you will not be able to sign in or access any of your personal

    information</span></strong>

      reserve the right to send you other communications, including service announcements, administrative messages, and surveys relating either to
      your account or to your transactions on this site, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</li>

      <li>You may have the opportunity on our website to provide a mobile number in order to receive your hotel confirmation details.</li>

      <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
      browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from
      this site, you will not be able to access portions of our site.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">Cookies and other technologies</span></strong><br>
    Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits). This website uses cookies for the
    following general purposes:<br>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser
      was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not
      need to log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Remember me."
      Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. Unless
      you register with us, these cookies will not contain any personal information.</li>

      <li>To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this website and on other sites across the Internet. For
      example, when you access a page on our website, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your
      browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See <u>Display
      of Advertising/Your Choices</u> for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.</li>

      <li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by
      determining which emails you open and act upon).</li>
    </ul>
    The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
    notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be
    able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as "flash cookies", on our web site. These are used to enhance
    your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with
    animated content on our website. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By
    themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable
    information that you have provided on this site, and cannot be accessed by other websites. To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable
    them, please click here: <a href='javascript:submitLink("http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html")'>

    This site may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
    in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
    within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement
    displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us
    understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the
    effectiveness of our content and other offerings.<br>

    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">Terms specific for mobile phone applications</span></strong>
    <br>
    When you use Hotels.com mobile for iOS or Android (the  “Application”) we collect and use your information in the same way and for the same
    purposes we do when you use our website. We also collect and use the following additional information automatically from your use of the
    Application:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Application enables us to track the areas you access within the Application which allows us to refine the arrangement of content.&nbsp;
      This information is collected anonymously and we cannot identify you from this. The Application also records the phone’s unique device
      identifier (called a “UUID” for iPhones and the “device ID” for Android enabled phones).&nbsp; We will only use the UUID/device ID on the first
      opening of the Application to confirm to various third parties that the Application has been downloaded and opened.</li>
      <li>When you use our ’find hotels near your current location’ feature, we use available geo-location data – provided by your phone using
      GPS or similar technologies to determine your location in order to show hotels nearby. Although this information is collected anonymously, this
      information may reveal to us your precise location. We only use this information to find and display nearby hotels. We do not collect location
      data unless you activate the ’find hotels near your current location’ feature within the Application. Sharing of location data can be switched
      off at any time in the settings menu.</li>
    </ul>
    If the Application encounters a problem and produces an error, the Application will send us information on this error so we can investigate the
    error and seek to improve the Application. These error reports tell us information about the handset type and version, the UUID/device ID, the
    time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred
    <br>
    If you do not wish us to collect and use this information via the Application in the ways set out above, please either disable this functionality
    (where the Application allows you to do so), or remove the Application from your handset and access our website.
    <br>
    We look to optimize the Application for iPhone and Android to minimize the data usage

    <u>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising.</u> The advertisements you see on this website are
    served by us or by our service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through <u>cookies
    and other technologies</u>. These third parties include (1) our corporate affiliate and partner Expedia.com; (2) business partners, who collect
    information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites; and (3) advertising networks, which collect information about
    your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information
    gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on
    our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about
    you (such as email address) on our site, nor do we share with them any personal information about you.<br>
    <br>
    Please note that we do not have access to or control over <u>cookies or other technologies</u> these third parties may use to collect information

    <u>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising.</u>Like other companies operating
    online, Hotels.com participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through <u>cookies
    and other technologies</u> and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third
    parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information
    (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site.

    We want you to feel confident about using this website to make travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect.
    While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help
    protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they
    may only do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your
    system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your
    information.<br>
    <br>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">Children's privacy</span></strong><br>
    This is a general audience website and does not offer services directed to children. Should we receive a request from a child whom we know to be
    under 13, we will use any personal information provided by the child for the sole purpose of responding once directly to that child's request and
    then will delete the personal information. If we otherwise gain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has provided any personal
    information to us, we will immediately delete this information.<br>
    <br>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">External links</span></strong><br>
    If any part of this website links you to other sites, those sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy
    statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.<br>
    <br>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">Visiting our website from outside the United States</span></strong><br>
    If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed
    in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States

    is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom
    we share it as described in this Policy. <br>
