# Hotjar – Privacy Policy

Date: 1st April 2015  
Version number: 2.0 

* * *

At Hotjar your privacy matters to us and we are committed to respect and protect your privacy and your personal information.

This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use and describes our privacy practices.

Our Privacy Policy explains the details of how Hotjar collects information from your browser and device when you access website pages. We also explain the choices we offer, making sure you are in control of your personal information at all times.

By visiting our website or by visiting one of our client's websites (which will provide you with notice of its use of Hotjar and this policy) or by signing up via our website, you acknowledge that you accept and consent to our privacy practices as outlined in this policy.

### Who and what is Hotjar?

Hotjar is a new all-in-one Analysis and Feedback tool that reveals the online behaviour and feedback of a website's visitors. By combining both A) Analysis and B) Feedback tools, Hotjar gives our clients the 'big picture' of how to improve their site's experience and its performance.

The Analysis tools allow you to measure and observe user behaviour (what users do) while the Feedback tools allow you to hear what your users say (Voice of User / Customer).

### How does Hotjar work?

By evaluating and analyzing feedback and behavioural patterns across a website's pages, through our code, software and service, our clients can improve the functionality of their websites and make them more user-friendly, more valuable and simpler for you to use.

Although this might sound scary, we ensure you that by sharing your behavioural patterns and any other information as described in this policy, with us and with our clients, you would be helping our clients provide you with a better experience and service.

Hotjar is run by Hotjar Ltd, a European startup incorporated in and headquartered in Malta. You can reach out with any questions or feedback by [contacting us here](https://web.archive.org/contact).
