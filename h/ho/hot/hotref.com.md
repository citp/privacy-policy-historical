Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site. One type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the HotRef site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the HotRef web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave HotRef. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the HotRef service, but is not linked to personally identifiable information in any way.
