# Hotel Tonight - Privacy Policy

[](https://web.archive.org/)

### Last updated: December 1, 2010

We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By using the HotelTonight mobile application (the “Application”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.**

  


### What Personal Information Do We Gather and Use?

**Personally Identifiable Information.** When you use the Application or the booking and other services available through the Application (the “Services”), you may provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, telephone number, postal address, date of birth, credit card number, expiration date, authentication code, or similar information. We may also collect personally identifiable information automatically when you use the Application or the Services. Finally, we might receive information about you from third-party sources, such as credit agencies. Some of the personally identifiable information we receive from you is needed to set up your account and transmit your reservation to a hotel. You can choose not to provide certain personally identifiable information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of the Services or other features available through the Application.

We use personally identifiable information to respond to your requests, sell you a hotel room, improve your shopping experience, customize future shopping for you, improve the Application, develop other mobile applications and Internet websites, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and to communicate with you. We also use such information to troubleshoot problems, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, enforce our agreements with you, including our License Agreement, Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law and cooperate with law enforcement activities.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information.** We also receive and store certain non-personally identifiable information, such as your mobile device type, operating system type, browser type and the like. This type of personal information does not identify you. We may also anonymize your personally identifiable information.

  


### How We Use and Share Information

We will not sell your personally identifiable information to anyone. We share personal information only as described below.

**Affiliated Businesses We Control.** Subject to applicable legal restrictions, we may share your personal information with the affiliated businesses we control to make sure that your experience with us is as seamless as possible and that you have the full benefit of our offerings. The use of such information by such controlled affiliates remains subject to this Privacy Policy.

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We work closely with hotels and other businesses that we do not control (“third party”). When you use the Application or Services to transact business with a third party, we may share your personally identifiable information with that party. Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not provide personally identifiable information to third parties for the marketing of their own products and services without your consent.

**Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. We share customer’s personally identifiable information with these agents as we deem necessary for them to perform their functions.

**Promotional Offers:** We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think may be of interest to you. In addition, we may also use personally identifiable information to notify you about important changes to our mobile applications, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your customer communication preferences.

**Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in this Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that HotelTonight is acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

  


### Children

HotelTonight does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use HotelTonight only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

  


### Updating and Correcting Information

We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Application. But you may delete the Application from your device at any time. In addition, in may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup information.

  


### Notice of Privacy Rights to California Residents.

California law requires that we provide you with a summary of your privacy rights under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (the “Act”) and the California Business and Professions Code. As required by the Act, we will provide you with the categories of Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through the Website and the categories of third party persons or entities with whom such Personally Identifiable Information may be shared for direct marketing purposes at your request. California law requires us to inform you, at your request, (1) the categories of Personally Identifiable Information we collect and what third parties we share that information with; (2) the names and addresses of those third parties; and (3) examples of the products marketed by those companies. The Act further requires us to allow you to control who you do not want us to share that information with. To obtain this information, please send a request by email or standard mail to the address found below. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what personally identifiable information you do not want us to share with affiliated businesses or third parties. The request should be sent to the attention of our legal department, and labeled “California Customer Choice Notice.” Please allow 30 days for a response. Also, please note that there is no charge for controlling the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information or requesting this notice.

  


### Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions

If you use the Application, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy, our the Apple End User License Agreement and our Terms of Service, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the State of California. If you have any concern about privacy at HotelTonight, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.
