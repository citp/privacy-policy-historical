# Privacy Policy

  


CityLine Travel respects the privacy of all of its users and is committed to protecting such privacy in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy explains CityLine Travel Inc.'s ("CityLine") treatment of your personally identifiable information collected in connection with your activities on or related to all CityLine websites referencing this Privacy Policy (the " CityLine Sites") and all services made available on the CityLine Sites (collectively, unless noted otherwise, the " CityLine Services"). This Privacy Policy also explains how you can ask questions and make suggestions about our privacy practices and review and update your personal information. 

We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully and to check back periodically as this Privacy Policy may change form time to time. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or websites which are not owned or controlled by CITYLINE. 

  


## INFORMATION COLLECTED

In the course of operating the CITYLINE Services, we may collect two types of information about our users: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.

**"Personal Information"** is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, birth date and gender. Personal Information is collected by us when you choose to provide it to us when registering for a CITYLINE Service, such as when you choose to subscribe to a CITYLINE Service, enter a CITYLINE promotion or choose to receive a CITYLINE newsletter. In addition, if you choose to contact any of our customer service representatives, we may keep a record of that correspondence so that we may fully address the subject matter. We may also receive Personal Information from our business partners and other third parties, provided that such third parties confirm to us that you have permitted them to share such information. 

Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, email address or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information. 

**"Non-Personal Information"** is information of an anonymous nature, such as an [Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)](https://web.archive.org/web/20040606185907id_/http%3A//www.destinux.com/normalpage.asp?page=467), the domain used to access a CITYLINE Service, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors and average time spent on a CITYLINE Service, is also considered Non-Personal Information. Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating the CITYLINE Services. For example, our Web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information which is provided through your browser or stored on a Cookie or through a Web Beacon when you choose to visit a CITYLINE Service. Non-Personal Information is used by CITYLINE as described here. 

  


## USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

Personal Information may be used by us for the following purposes: 

  * Providing you with the CITYLINE Services and information you have requested from us, including your use of the CITYLINE Sites. We may from time to time use your Personal Information to contact you about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to the CITYLINE Services; 

  * If you indicated that you were interested in receiving offers or information from CITYLINE or certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, CITYLINE or such sponsors or advertisers may send you email materials and other mailings about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. If at any time you would like to end your subscription to any such email materials, follow the directions posted at the bottom of the email material; 

  * If you enter a contest or other promotion offered on a CITYLINE Site, we may, under the rules of the promotion, use your name and certain other information to administer the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion; 

  * CITYLINE may also use Personal Information if it has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful when investigating a contravention of a federal, provincial or foreign law or in order to protect or defend a legal interest. 


  


## DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We will not sell or rent your Personal Information to anyone. We will only disclose your Personal Information to third parties:   


  * Where you have specifically given us your consent to disclose your Personal Information for a designated purpose; 

  * Who are acting on our behalf as our agents, suppliers or service providers, solely to enable us to more efficiently provide you with the CITYLINE Services. Such entities act under strict contractual controls, requiring them to maintain the confidentiality of all such Personal Information and to use such information solely for purposes related to the provision of the CITYLINE Services; 

  * As may be set out in the Terms and Conditions applicable to a CITYLINE Service, to facilitate the provision of such CITYLINE Service, such as fulfilling legal requirements; 

  * As required by law, including by an order of any court, institution or body with jurisdiction or authority to compel the production of information, or in order to protect or defend a legal interest; or 

  * In connection with a CITYLINE corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of the assets of CITYLINE provided that the Personal Information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information. 




## LINKS TO OTHER SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS

A CITYLINE Service may contain links to other websites and services. While we try to link only to sites and services that share our high standards and respect for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This Privacy Policy applies only to the CITYLINE Services referencing this Privacy Policy. 

The majority of the advertisements which are displayed in connection with the CITYLINE Services are served through a reputable third party advertisement serving partner. 

  


## SECURITY

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. CITYLINE takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We instruct our employees with access to your Personal Information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. 

In certain areas, such as when you provide credit card information to us, we work to help protect the security of your credit card information during transmission by using industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. 

You can help protect the security of your Personal Information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access your Account or Registration Information. Also remember to log out of your account and close your browser window when you finish using a CITYLINE Service or surfing the Web, so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information. 

  


## CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY 

CITYLINE may from time to time change its Privacy Policy as new CITYLINE Services are added or old ones changed. Changes will be effective when notice of such change is posted at a CITYLINE Site. Please check this Privacy Policy regularly for updates by checking the date of "Last Update" at the top of this document. 

  


## ADDITIONAL PRIVACY PROCEDURES 

Privacy procedures specific to a CITYLINE Service can be found on a CITYLINE Site at the location of the particular CITYLINE Service, or in additional terms referenced at such CITYLINE Site. Those procedures are an addendum to this policy, and are provided to you at the place where they will be of most use and relevance to you.

CITYLINE provides you with the means to access, update, edit or delete any Account or Registration Information you may have provided to us at any time on your own by going to the appropriate page in the Account or Registration section of the relevant CITYLINE Service, and changing or deleting such information as desired. 

If you are unsure whether we have a record containing any of your Personal Information and would like to confirm whether or not we do, please send an e-mail to our Privacy Manager at privacy@destinux.com , indicating all e-mail addresses that you may have given us.
