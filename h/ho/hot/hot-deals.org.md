**Information Collection and Use**  
  
Hot Deals Club is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Hot Deals Club collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
  
This web site contains mostly links to other sites. Please be aware that we (Hot Deals Club) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Registration**  
  
Some areas of this website may require the user to first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

**Cookies**  
  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Cookies can enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. The Hot Deals Club website does not use any cookies at this time. Users will be notified when the site begins using cookies. Our advertising business partner will use cookies on our site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Log Files**  
  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**  
  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

**Mailing List**  
  
Only invited users may subscribe to our mailing list. If an invited user wishes to subscribe to our mailing list, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. 

**Surveys & Contests**  
  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Security**  
  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

**Supplementation of Information**  
  
In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our visitors, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. In order for this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we combine information about the browsing & clicking habits of users with similar information from our partners, Hot Deals Club, and Website Network, to create a personalized user profile. When a user clicks on a link within the Hot Deals Club domain, we log the clickthroughs so we can tailor the site to our users' preferences. We will not disclose specific information (such as IP address, time & date) about our users' clicks. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service(s), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by emailing the Hot Deals Maniac. 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
  
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our mailing list has an "opt-out" mechanism so members can cancel their subscriptions at any time.   
  
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

**Notification of Changes**  
  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

**Emails**  
  
If you wish to submit a "hot deal" or talk to the author of this website, you may send email to the Hot Deals Maniac. From time to time, we may decide to share your email with the other visitors on this site. Thus, emails received by the Hot Deals Club are subject to being posting on this website, unless the sender requests that their email not be posted. If we decide to post your email letter on this website, it will be stripped of any personal information, such as your name, email address, and phone number, unless the email we received was threatening or abusive. Please note that due to a heavy amount of emails we receive, the person who responds to your email may be a privlidged member of the Hot Deals Club, not necessarilly the owner of the Hot Deals Club.
