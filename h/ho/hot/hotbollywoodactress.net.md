## Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

HotBollywoodActress.Net allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the HotBollywoodActress.Net Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the HotBollywoodActress.Net Sites.

The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the HotBollywoodActress.Net Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
