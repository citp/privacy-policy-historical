# Security and Privacy Policy Information - Hotel Chocolat

Hotel Chocolat is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and that we fully comply at all times with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.

**1\. The information we collect and how we use it**

When you order or enquire about our products we need to know your name, address, email address, and, if ordering, your credit card number and expiry date. If you have ordered products for a third party we will need to know their delivery address. We gather this information to allow us to process your registration and process any orders you may make. The relevant information is then used by us, our agents and sub-contractors to organise delivery, provide you with statements of your account and to communicate with you on any matter relating to the conduct of your account and the provision of our service.

We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our services and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any individual. From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the products and services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you by mail, email or telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our products and services.

We and our group companies may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our website or any other service or products we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please click [here](http://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/my-account/manage-your-communication-preferences).

**3\. How we protect your information**

Security is a major issue for anyone purchasing on the internet. You need to know that a website is legitimate, and transactions are secure before you buy. To address these issues, the Hotel Chocolat website uses a Digital Certificate from Comodo. Our secure server software uses the digital certificate to encrypt your credit card number. The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of code which are then securely transmitted over the internet. We also keep your information confidential. The internal procedures of Hotel Chocolat cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.

**4\. Sale of business**

If this business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.

If you wish to cancel your registration, please send an email by clicking [here](mailto:help@hotelchocolat.com), or by sending a letter to Hotel Chocolat Ltd, Mint House, Royston, Hertfordshire, SG8 5HL, England.

**6\. Your consent**

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times.
