    <br>
    <p>
        This privacy policy applies to all personal information collected by Hotfrog Group via the
        internet.</p>
    <p>
        Hotfrog Group recognises the importance of your privacy, and that you have a right to control
        how your personal information is collected and used. We know that providing personal
        information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you directly give
        us consent to do otherwise, Hotfrog Group will only collect and use your personal information
        as set out below.</p>
    <h4>
        Collection of information</h4>
    <p>
        The four main ways we collect personal information about you are:
        </p><ul>
            <li>when information about you is posted on a Hotfrog Group website, either by you or by a third
                party; </li>
            <li>when you log into a Hotfrog Group website or otherwise submit personal information to Hotfrog Group;
            </li>
            <li>when you use a Hotfrog Group website, in which case our system automatically collects information
                relating to your visit to that website, such as your IP address; and</li>
            <li>through the operation of CatchBot, Hotfrog Group's web crawler (described in more detail below).</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4>
        Third party consent</h4>
    <p>
        In addition, we may collect your personal information when you have given your consent
        to another party who holds personal information about you to allow us access to
        that personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The type of information that we collect from you may include the following: your
        name, phone number, address, email address, company position/title, credit card
        details, IP address, cookies, personal information that you include in your business
        profile or personal information that you email/send using email functionality on
        a Hotfrog Group website.</p>
    <h4>
        Our use of cookies</h4>
    <p>
        Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard
        disk for record keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. Hotfrog Group
        uses cookies to make your use of our websites and services as convenient as possible.
        Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do
        identify a user's browser. Cookies are useful to estimate our number of users and
        determine overall traffic patterns through our website.</p>
    <p>
        If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies.
        This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of Hotfrog Group's services.</p>
    <p>
        <i>Google cookies </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hotfrog Group uses Google to serve advertisements when you visit a Hotfrog Group website. Google may
        use cookies in relation to your visits to Hotfrog Group websites in order to provide advertisements
        about goods and services which may be of interest to you. If you would like more
        information about this practice and to know your choices about Google not using
        cookies in this way, <a href="http://www.google.com.au/privacy_ads.html">click here</a>.</p>
    <h4>
        Using and disclosing your personal information</h4>
    <p>
        Our purpose in collecting information about you is to:
        </p><ul>
            <li>provide you with a better service experience with content and advertising that is
                more relevant to your interests; and</li>
            <li>create a business information database and associated content for use as part of
                Hotfrog Group's online business. Whilst Hotfrog's business information database is designed to
                operate as a business directory (not a directory of individuals) it is possible
                that personal information may become included in the business information database.</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Hotfrog Group will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent, unless:
        </p><ul>
            <li>the use or disclosure is for one of the purposes described above or otherwise permitted
                by this policy;</li>
            <li>it is required or permitted by law (including by relevant privacy laws);</li>
            <li>we believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested;</li>
            <li>to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another Hotfrog Group website user,
                any member of the public or Hotfrog Group; or</li>
            <li>any of the assets and/or operations of Hotfrog Group are being transferred to another party.</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        If you do not provide requested information, Hotfrog Group may not be able to provide you
        with access to or full use of sections of the Hotfrog Group website.</p>
    <h4>
        Disclosing information</h4>
    <p>
        Sometimes, the activities described above require us to share your personal information
        with other organisations. The types of situations in which Hotfrog Group usually discloses
        personal information, and the types of organisations to which such disclosure is
        usually made, include the following:
        </p><ul>
            <li>The business information database is available via the internet to any member of
                the public. It is also disclosed in its entirety to Hotfrog Group's related entities and to
                other entities with whom Hotfrog Group has a business relationship, as part of Hotfrog Group's online
                business.</li>
            <li>Hotfrog Group discloses personal information to its service providers, advisers and other
                entities with whom Hotfrog Group has a business relationship, in the course of operating the
                Hotfrog Group websites and Hotfrog Group online business and in the course of delivering the Hotfrog Group services.</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4>
        Marketing</h4>
    <p>
        In seeking to give you the most worthwhile experience of our websites possible,
        Hotfrog Group may use your personal information to send you information and product updates
        about Hotfrog Group websites and services, or other parties’ products and services, or to
        permit other parties to send other information about products or services which
        may be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may contact you at any email or other address or contact point which we have
        collected or obtained in order to:
        </p><ul>
            <li>contact you about your business profile or other content such as reviews which you
                have posted on a Hotfrog Group website;</li>
            <li>provide you with updated information about Hotfrog Group websites; or</li>
            <li>provide you with other information about other products or services which you may
                enjoy.</li>
