We may also use your personal information for other purposes described in the “How we use your information” section below.

When you use one of your smart phone app, tablet app, or applications for other platforms (collectively “App” or “Apps” as applicable), we may also collect, for example:

Information about the functionality of the Apps you access and use. This allows us to identify those areas of the Apps that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Apps. Your device’s unique device identifier (“UID”). Each App sends us the device's UID, a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your device. We use this on the first opening of the App so that we can confirm to our advertising networks the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their respective ad banners and other marketing tools. When an email address is provided, we associate this with your current UID/cookie ID for the purposes of providing a seamless experience across your devices. Information about your current location. When you use an App’s ‘find hotels near your current location’ or similar features that suggest relevant content based on location, or otherwise provide location-based services, we use information about your current location – provided by your device using GPS or similar technologies – to show relevant content or other localized information. We do not collect location data unless you expressly use a location-based feature, and you can switch off location data collection at any time through your phone settings menu. Error reporting information. This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the App for future releases. As part of these error reports, the App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We may use this information to investigate and remediate the error and to assist you in completing an impacted booking. You have the ability to control what information an App sends to us. You can exercise this control either by changing the settings of the App under its setting menu or changing the settings of your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the App from your device entirely and access our services through our website.

If you make use of any of our social media features on our online services or otherwise through a social media provider, we may access information about you via that social media provider in accordance with their privacy policy.

Subject to your privacy settings, we access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations (“Location Data”) to provide you with relevant content. We do not store or use any data related to the friends you are connected with on a social media site.

We may also access information from social media providers about your use of an App that we run on their website. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any social media provider you use.

EU General Data Protection Regulation "GDPR"

LEXYL shall Process Personal Data only on the written instruction of its group coordinators and in accordance with our Terms of Use and applicable laws (unless LEXYL is otherwise required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, in which case LEXYL shall inform its group coordinators of such legal requirement save where prohibited to do so by applicable law), and the group coordinator confirms that its documented instructions are for LEXYL to process the Personal Data as necessary for the purposes of our Terms of Use.

LEXYL shall upon termination or expiry of the terms of use and upon the group coordinator's request, delete or return to all Personal Data save that, in the event that LEXYL is unable to destroy the Personal Data (due to backup or legal reasons), LEXYL shall continue to extend indefinitely the protections of these Requirements and immediately terminate any further Processing of the Personal Data without the group coordinator's express prior written consent, except where and to the extent required by applicable law.
