## What information is being collected?

**Personal and Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

We collect “Personal Information”, as well as non-personally identifiable information on HotCopper Sites and/or Services. “Personal Information,” as used in this Policy, is personally identifiable information, such as your first and last name, email address, IP addresses, demographics, passwords, 708 sophisticated investor status, telephone numbers and/or other online contact information. 

**Sensitive Information**

HotCopper does not collect sensitive information from users for marketing purposes. “Sensitive Information” includes information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, health or genetic information, sexual preference or information about whether an individual is a member of a professional or trade association or union.  
Sensitive information might be collected during the course of surveys or competitions administered by HotCopper or its affiliated third parties, but only if volunteered by Users with their consent.  
You can choose not to actively volunteer information to HotCopper. However if you do provide information to HotCopper when asked or prompted, including Sensitive Information, you are also providing consent for HotCopper to collect, store and use that information as necessary for the purpose of collecting it. 

## Security and Integrity

We take reasonable measures, including the implementation and maintenance of physical, electronic, and managerial procedures, in an effort to assure the security, integrity, and accuracy of all Personal Information that we collect. If we learn of a security systems breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.  
We store information on networks in Australia and Singapore and take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information from misuse, loss or unauthorised access. These reasonable steps include password access, VPNs, firewalls, and secure servers. 

## How We Use Information

Generally, we use Personal Information to establish and enhance our relationship with our Users through four main categories: 

  1. Communication
  2. Optimisation
  3. Marketing & Advertising; and
  4. Sharing Features.



Below, we provide some specific examples of how we use the information we collect.

### Communication and Responding to Requests

To provide you with customer support, share communications such as newsletters, respond to users’ requests, send newsletters and updates, send special offers and advertisements, seek your opinions and feedback, and connect users to HotCopper Sites and/or Services and to products and services of our partners and licensees.

### Optimisation

To provide, improve, and maintain our Sites and Services, to develop new products and services, to prevent abuse and fraud, to personalise and display advertisements and other content for you, and for other administrative and internal business purposes.

### Marketing & Advertising

We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined: 

  * Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers;
  * Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
  * Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, groups participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
  * Information from advertising partners and publishers such as Google, Nielsen and Roy Morgan; and 
  * Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender).



We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labelled “ads” or “sponsored.” If you take an action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. 

We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks for their advertising except for: (i) hashed or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g. profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our site or apps, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may through the use of mechanisms such as cookies determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so. 

We use data and content about Members for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services. 

### Sharing Features

Sharing features relates to the use of third party services made available to you on the HotCopper site. These features provide you with various ways to connect and share content with third parties, such as subscription research services or by posting sharing a post on your personal email, facebook or twitter services.  
By using any third party service to share links to our content, you permit us to access, use and disclose information relating to your account on each such third party service (such as your user name and profile information) if available to us through the third party service. This information is used in accordance with this privacy policy and for the delivery of the third party service requested. 

### When We Disclose Personal Information

HotCopper will not sell, license or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to third parties unless such disclosure is for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. 

## Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if we are legally bound to do so or if, in our reasonable opinion, such disclosure is necessary to prevent harm to ourselves, other users or a third party. We will notify you of such disclosure in all such instances.  
Division 3 Part 3 of the ASIC Act outlines ASIC’s power to seek these records. Most often the notice will be addressed directly to the company or to an eligible addressee, usually a director, and will order the delivery of specified books and documents. The term ‘books’, as outlined in the ASIC Act is a broad term that can be defined as any form of stored information which include personal data covered by this Privacy Policy. HotCopper is obliged to disclose all information requested by ASIC to ASIC on receiving an appropriate notice under the ASIC Act. 

### Interactive Features

Any Personal Information that you submit, display, or publish on a forum, blog, channel, bulletin board, chat room, user commenting feature or other interactive sharing or social feature offered through our Sites and/or Services, is considered publicly available and can be read, collected, used, and disclosed by other users of those features, by us and other third parties without restriction, except to the extent limited access features are available.

If you do not submit the relevant Personal information then that may limit our ability to respond to your customer support inquiry in a timely fashion or enable access to the service or competition.
