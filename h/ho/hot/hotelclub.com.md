**How we use the information**  
When you become a member of HotelClub or submit a booking request, we use the collected information in several ways: 

In addition, if you have opted to sign up for membership offered by our website, your email address will be used to send you an email message confirming your new member registration.

However, you may always unsubscribe from receiving these email messages. Please see our Opting Out policy described below.

We disclose your information to third parties (such as our hotels) only for the purpose of completing your transaction with us, providing the above services to you and for the purposes of associated administration. We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

Unless otherwise prohibited by law or our contractual obligations, we may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. Such situations may include: to perform, maintain or enforce contracts with our customers; to protect the rights or properties of Flairview Travel, our business affiliates, our customers, or others; or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing, or who may be threatening to cause, interference with or damage to our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise; or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.

Like most web sites, there is certain information we automatically track, including the URL that you just came from, the browser you are using and your IP address. This data is utilised to improve the services of HotelClub and does not include any personally identifying information.
