**Privacy Protection at Hotcouponworld**

This web site is owned and operated by Coupon Girls, LLC. (CG). In an effort to protect your privacy, the CG privacy policy was developed to explain our practices for the website domain [www.hotcouponworld.com](http://www.hotcouponworld.com/). Please read the policy carefully before sharing any personal identity information.

CG collects and tracks certain automatic, non-personal identifiers including but not limited to IP addresses, internet browsers, and information regarding traffic patterns so we can better serve our members needs. This can include, but is not limited to, transferring the information to business partners as it relates to site development. CG also employs the use of “cookies” to help you access the board. Cookies can be turned off in your own browser; however, it may interfere with certain features of the site.

CG also collects and stores optionally-provided personal identifiers which you have entered into the UserCP, or other databases upon registration, or as provided to the site by our affiliated merchants with whom you have shopped through our site. Providing CG personal identifiers constitutes authorization to collect/store the information and use the information as necessary. CG does not sell your information to third party companies without member consent, except in the instance of a sale or merger of www.hotcouponworld.com with another company. Please be aware that personal identifiers that you put out through the site on public pages, such as in forums, can be viewed by anyone and as such, the use of that information cannot be controlled by CG.

Security is important to us. We have safeguards to protect the secure information you provide us. However, due to open access of the Internet, we can make no guarantee that we can protect your information from third parties, including hackers. Your membership agreement implies your understanding of the inherent risk of the Internet as it relates to personal identifiers.

We do not intentionally collect personal identifiers about children under 13, and will delete information provided to use without parental or guardian consent.

Users can opt-out and have personal identifiers removed in conjunction with termination of their user account at [www.hotcouponworld.com](http://www.hotcouponworld.com/). Users can opt-out by contacting us at [optout@hotcouponworld.com](mailto:optout@hotcouponworld.com). It is incumbent on you to opt-out and be removed from third-party company lists with whom you previously provided personal identifiers in accordance with the policy.
