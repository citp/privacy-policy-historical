<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>HotNewDeal, LLC (herein after “HotNewDeal”) values its users on the HotNewDeal.com web site, mobile site and apps (“Properties”) and the services offered on our Properties (we will refer to the Properties and all other services collectively as the “Services”). HotNewDeal has implemented this Privacy Policy to inform users of the information that HotNewDeal collects from you and what HotNewDeal does with it after it is collected. By using the Services, you are agreeing to the practices described in this policy.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact HotNewDeal at: privacy@HotNewDeal.com.</p>
<p><strong>Does HotNewDeal.com Ever Make Changes to its Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
<p>HotNewDeal may make changes to the Privacy Policy from time to time. HotNewDeal will notify you of any changes by sending you an email, Private Message, or posting a notice on our Web site or other Properties. In such case, you should review the new Privacy Policy carefully to make sure you understand HotNewDeal new privacy practices. &nbsp;If you use the Services after we provide notice of a change, you are necessarily agreeing to the changed terms.</p>
<p><strong>What Types of Information Does HotNewDeal.com Collect From Me?</strong></p>
<p>HotNewDeal will collect the personal information you provide when you register, take a survey, sign up for notifications, register for a sweepstakes or giveaway, email us or otherwise send us your information. This information may include your name, email address and other information that can be used to identify you. You can use some of the Services without providing any personal information but some features may not be available.</p>
<p>Each time you use the Services, HotNewDeal also collects other, non-personal information from you, such as your browser type, the URL of the previous web site you visited, your ISP, operating system, and your IP Address. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device. If you receive email from us, we will track related information such as if an email is opened and whether you click on an ad or offer in the email. In addition, like the operators of most web sites, HotNewDeal uses analytic and reporting technologies to record information such as Internet domain and host names, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser software and operating system types, clickstream patterns, and the dates and times that the Properties and the other Services are accessed.</p>
<p>If you log in via a third party service like Facebook or Google, we will access the information described in the request for authorization. You should review your privacy settings with these third party services to be sure you are only sharing information you wish to share.</p>

<p><strong>What About Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>In addition, HotNewDeal uses “cookies,” a small data string our server writes to your computer, and other tracking technology to help us manage and track your interaction with the Services. These technologies collect non-personally identifiable information to improve the Services, including to keep count of return visits to the Properties or our advertisers’ or partners’ websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, save your password and login information, and display advertising or content based on your interests. HotNewDeal may also collect other data such as search criteria and results, date, time, connection speed and IP addresses.

<p><strong>Do Third Parties Gather My Information?</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Properties. These companies may use non-personal information (i.e., not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the Properties and other online properties (e.g., Web sites, mobile sites and apps) in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

<p>In addition, like millions of other websites, we use analytics services provided by third parties such as Google and Flurry.

<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, along with third-party vendors, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Double Click cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, along with third-party vendors, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Double Click cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits of our site.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may use data from Google’s Interest-based advertising or 3<sup>rd</sup>-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics to improve the ads you see online, and to give you meaningful choices over how that information is used. Google offers you several ways to control the information that’s gathered through interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads at <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" target="_blank">www.google.com/ads/preferences</a>.</p>
<p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser and opt out of certain other forms of tracking. &nbsp; If you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Properties.</p>
