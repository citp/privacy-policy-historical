Your personal information is important to us

We are subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). 

We respect the importance of your privacy, and that you have a right to make your own choices about how your personal information is collected and used. We know that when you provide personal information to us you are showing your trust and we take that seriously.

You have no obligation to provide any information requested by us.  However, if you choose to withhold your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the Services or products that depend on the collection and use of that information.

How and what personal information do we collect

We collect your personal information for the HOYTS Services in a number of ways, including:

\- directly from you through website purchases, when signing up to the HOYTS Rewards or HOYTS Insider programs, employment applications and phone calls and email correspondence.  
\-  from third parties including our partners, suppliers and public authorities.

The types of personal information we collect includes:

Our purpose in collecting this information is to assist us to provide product and service information tailored to your interests and to provide you with a customised experience across the whole range of HOYTS Services. We will also collect information in order for us to be able to assess any employment applications.

(b) Use and disclosure of your personal information

We will use or disclose your personal information for our primary purpose of providing you product and Service information tailored to your interests and to provide you with a customised experience across the whole range of HOYTS Services.

We may also use your personal information to send you marketing information and advertisements about products and Services which we think are likely to be of interest to you. If you wish to opt out of receiving any further marketing or advertising material from us, please email us at http://www.hoyts.com.au/guest_service/contact_us.aspx, or click “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the email messages we send you. 

Some advertisements displayed on our website or through the Hoyts mobile app are provided by the specialist company ROKT, and when you order our goods and services on‑line we may provide limited information about you to ROKT so that these can be personalised.  Any information collected by ROKT is subject to its privacy policy (<http://rokt.com/blog/privacy-policy/>).

From time to time, HOYTS conducts competition on its website.  When we run these competitions, we may also give you the choice of being on a mailing list to receive further contact from us.  Unless you choose to receive further communications from HOYTS, the information we collect from your entry in the competition is not used for any purposes other than for the competition. 

(c) To whom do we disclose your personal information?

We provide your personal information to a third party marketing company which aggregates and de-identifies the information and provide us with a report that assists us in marketing the HOYTS Services.  We share these transactional information reports with advertisers to ensure only relevant advertisements are provided to you.

We may also share your personal information with a service partner (such as auditors, lawyers, couriers, computer security companies, hosting services and ROKT) or a company or person related to us, for example, a related body corporate, a common shareholder or someone with whom we share some common commercial interest. To the extent that these service partners, companies or persons are located in Australia and we give them access to your personal information, they are subject to privacy legislation which prevents them from using the information for any other purposes.

We may also disclose your personal information to participating rewards program partners for the following purposes:

  1. Ensuring that you are credited with points earned with rewards program partners;
  2. Ensuring that you are able to redeem points earned with rewards program partners;
  3. To optimise the benefits available to you under rewards program partners; and
  4. To optimise offers from rewards program partners to purchase HOYTS products.



We may also disclose your personal information to our overseas service providers which have servers located in Sweden and the United States of America. We require the overseas service provider to handle your personal information in accordance with Australian privacy principles. We remain committed to safeguarding your personal information.

We will not otherwise use, disclose or share your personal information with a third party without your consent, unless:

\- required by the law;  
\- we believe on reasonable grounds that disclosure is required to prevent or lessen significant risk to the life or physical, mental or emotional health of the consumer or another person;  
\- we take appropriate action in relation to a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity, or misconduct of a serious nature, that relates to our functions or activities;  
\- disclosure is required to assist any entity, body or person to locate a person who has been reported as missing;  
\- disclosure is made for the purpose of establishing, exercising or defending a legal or equitable claim; or  
\- disclosure is made for the purposes of a confidential alternative dispute resolution process.

Cookies also enable us to offer products and Services that can be bought on line.

We use Google Analytics (including Google Remarketing) which uses both first party and third-party cookies to record standard internet traffic information such as when, and how many times, you have visited our site.  We and some third parties (including Google) also use the information from the cookies to optimize ad selection for groups of individuals based on age, gender, interests and past visits to our site.  The cookies also allow us and other third parties to evaluate your interactions with ad services on our site. We have enabled Google Analytics for Display Advertising which allows Google and other third parties to advertise to you on our site, you can opt out of this feature through Google Ads Settings.

Importantly, we do not combine the anonymous information collected through Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.

If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. However, this will mean you will not be able to take full advantage of the HOYTS Services. For example, we will not be able to personalise your website each time you visit.

You can access and correct the personal information we keep about you

Alternatively, you can access or correct your personal information by contacting us using the ‘Contact Details’ set out below.  Please provide us with as much detail as you can about the particular information you wish to access or correct, in order to help us retrieve it.  We may charge you an access fee to cover our costs of providing that information to you.  We will inform you of applicable fees before they are incurred.

In certain circumstances, such as where there is a criminal inquiry, we may refuse your request to access, or correct, your personal information.  If that is the case, we will provide you with reasons for that decision unless it is unreasonable to do so.

We take reasonable steps to make sure that personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and relevant.

For example, access to your personal information is restricted within HOYTS to employees who have specific authorisation to access such information.

We continually endeavour to improve our security safeguards. However, no data transmission over the internet is guaranteed to be perfectly secure, so we cannot absolutely promise that the information you provide to us using the internet will always be totally secure.

If you apply for employment with HOYTS, we will review all of your information for the role you've applied for and determine whether or not to make a formal offer of employment to you.  If we make an offer to you, the information you have provided to us will form part of your employee record.  If we do not make an offer to you at this stage, we will normally retain your information for a period of 3 months.  We may in the future contact you in the event that another position becomes available for which you may wish to apply.
