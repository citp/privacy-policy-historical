**Fake emails using Honda's name**  
Honda is aware of fake emails, popularly called "phishing" emails regarding job advertisements, job offers and competition award notifications. These emails use Honda’s name to pretend they are genuine and exist solely for the purpose of obtaining private information about consumers (e.g. credit card numbers or passwords). These emails have no connection with Honda and Honda does not use these methods for job advertising or competition / award winner activity. 

Unfortunately these fake emails are a growing fraud on the Internet. This practice is carried out either by the sending of a bogus email directly to a victim, or by directing them to a website where personal information is requested.

You can usually identify a fake job offer from Honda, as there will be many inconsistencies throughout the document. Recent examples have been sent from ‘Honda Motor Company UK’ (which is not a valid legal entity). The email has then directed people to make a payment to a false UK based solicitor firm, using the name ‘Clifford Chambers Solicitors’. Neither is connected to Honda in any way. 

Fake job offers tend to target overseas individuals, as they ask for money to be sent to them for UK visa purposes. Honda never requests payments details in association with any job applications or any communication related to them. If in any doubt about the validity of a recruitment offer, please contact [huk.recruitment@honda-eu.com](mailto:huk.recruitment@honda-eu.com)

Recent email award notifications have purported to be from the Honda Security Department, Honda's Lottery Department and Honda Grand Promotions UK. Honda never requests payments details in association with competition winners or any communication related to them.

Honda advises that if you receive an email using Honda’s name and asking for personal information or financial information and have concerns about its authenticity, then please treat such emails with extreme caution.
