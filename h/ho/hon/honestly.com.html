	  <div class="bd static_p">

	        <p>Unvarnished, Inc.( "Company") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy extremely seriously. </p>
	        <p>Central to the goal of open and honest community-surfaced professional reputation is the candor enabled by sharing your opinions about other professionals, without your name being publicly associated with reviews you author. To defend that candor, we are seriously committed to protecting the privacy of our users, and will never share personal information except as governed by this privacy policy or required by law. </p>

	    <p>Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.  By visiting the http://www.honestly.com website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>
	        <h2>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2>
	        <p>This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you access the Website and when you use Company’s services.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>
	        <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</h2>
	        <p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>
	        <h2>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h2>
	        <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way.  The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, reviews, review votes public profile information, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.  The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Company’s products and services, including specials and new features.</p>
	        <h2>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h2>
	        <ul class="marb10">
	        <li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services.  Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.</li>

	<li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services.  As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services.  We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</li>
	</ul>
	        <h2>E-mail Communications:</h2>
	        <p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful.  We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.  When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.</p>

	        <h2>What About Cookies?</h2>

	        <ul class="marb10">
	        <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.  We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality.</li>

We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website’s most attractive features.</li>
	<li>Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies.
