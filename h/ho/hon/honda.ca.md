## Honda Canada Customer Privacy Policy

Honda Canada Inc. (“Honda”) sells Honda and Acura brand products and services (“Products and Services”) in Canada. Honda is committed to ensuring that personal information collected from its customers is appropriately protected and that their privacy is respected.

  * **Why does Honda Collect Personal Information?**

Honda collects your personal information in order to:

(a) complete your transaction for the purchase, finance or lease of Products and Services;   
(b) maintain our records to provide you with warranty or other customer service communications;  
(c) advise you of any product recalls, customer campaigns, or customer notices regarding your vehicle;   
(d) market products and services to you;   
(e) respond to your comments or requests for information; and   
(f) meet our legal obligations and other legitimate business purposes. 

  * **What Personal Information Does Honda Collect and How Does Honda Collect It?**

Honda collects information necessary for the purposes stated above that will enable it to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number(s), type of Honda products owned, and purchase and repair history of Products and Services. Honda collects this information directly from you, our affiliates, Dealers, service providers, and onboard vehicle systems. 

  * **How Does Honda Use and Share Your Personal Information?**

Honda may share your personal information with its affiliates, Dealers or its service providers. Honda may disclose your personal information as required by law, in connection with a government inquiry, law enforcement activities or in litigation or dispute resolution. Honda will only send email, text or other electronic messages to you with your consent (unless you have directed us not to do so), if you have requested information, or if you have a service contract or existing product warranty with Honda.

  * **Honda Safeguards Your Personal Information**

Honda takes appropriate security and other measures to preserve the confidentiality of your personal information and to ensure that it is used for the intended purposes. Honda retains your personal information only as long as necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law. Honda requires that its service providers with access to your personal information keep this information strictly confidential and they are only permitted to use your personal information for the sole purpose of carrying out services for Honda.

Your personal information may be stored and/or processed or otherwise used by or on behalf of Honda both inside and outside of Canada. If a Honda service provider is located outside Canada, your personal information may be processed and stored in a country that has laws that are different from those in Canada, and where the government (e.g. the United States) may be able to obtain disclosure of your personal information under their local laws.

While Honda encourages its Dealers to fully comply with all applicable privacy legislation, each Dealership is a separate legal entity, independent from Honda, and is responsible for their own compliance with applicable law.

  * **Questions About Your Personal Information**

If you are an owner of a Honda or Acura brand product, you may contact Honda toll free at 1-888-946-6329 (from 8:30 - 5:00 EST Monday - Friday) for the purposes of accessing or correcting your personal information or to advise Honda not to use your information for sales or marketing purposes. 

If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, you can contact our Chief Privacy Officer at: 

Honda Canada Inc.
