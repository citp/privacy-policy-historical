          <p>Thank you for your interest in Honeyfund.com, Inc. (referred to herein as "we" or "us") and our website, <a href="http://www.honeyfund.com/">www.honeyfund.com</a> (the "Site"). This privacy policy was created to let you know why we  collect information from you and what we do with it. By using the Site,  you consent to the following terms.</p>
          <p>This statement discloses the privacy practices of Honeyfund.com, Inc. It covers:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the Honeyfund.com website </li>
            <li>How the information is used</li>
            <li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
            <li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information</li>
            <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>How we collect your information</h3>
          <h4>Information collected at registration</h4>
          <p>Honeyfund.com, Inc.  collects personal information when you register with us and when you  use Honeyfund services. Honeyfund.com, Inc. may combine this information  about you with information we obtain from business partners or  companies. During registration, we require members to give us basic  contact information (such as your and your future spouse's first names,  last names and e-mail addresses), wedding and honeymoon information (such as your wedding date and preferred honeymoon destination) and demographic information (such as  your zip or postal code). Registration information is  collected via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol (https).
The information requested on the  registration form may change from time to time. Although additional  demographic information may be requested at the time of registration,  only information marked "required" is necessary for registration and  utilization of our services.</p>
          <p>Users who give gifts to Honeyfund.com members are not  required to register. However, some information is collected during the  "Give a Gift" process, including first and last name and e-mail  address. This information is associated with the member's account. The e-mail  address collected during the “Give a Gift” process is kept private and not  shared with third parties. It is  used by Honeyfund.com, Inc. to communicate with the gift giver regarding their gift. </p>
          <p>We do not accept registrations  from persons under the age of 18. Honeyfund services are available only  to persons who are 18 years of age and over. If we learn that a user is  under the age of 18, we will terminate the account and delete the  user's information. Honeyfund.com, Inc. will not be liable for any content or  advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the terms of  this agreement.</p>
          <h4>Information collected through use of Honeyfund.com</h4>
          <p>In  addition to the questions you answer when you register for  Honeyfund.com membership, we collect information necessary to create  your honeymoon registry, including but not limited to at least one  registry item and a contact person. Personal information is  collected via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol (https).
When you enter this information and  publish your honeymoon registry, you agree to make it public and  accessible by visitors to Honeyfund.com.  Note you are responsible for obtaining permission to publish your contact person's information like name and telephone number.</p>
          <p>Honeyfund.com, Inc.  also collects system information such as IP addresses (in other words,  the location of your computer on the Internet) for system  administration, troubleshooting, security, and to examine overall  traffic trends. (For example, IP addresses help us determine the  percentage of people coming from various search engines, such as Google  or Yahoo!) This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for  administrative purposes. IP addresses may be linked to personal account  information for security purposes, for instance, to prevent spammers  from abusing Honeyfund.com, Inc.'s e-mail features.</p>
          <p>Honeyfund.com, Inc.  and its partners use cookies, small data files stored on your computer,  to customize portions of our site to your preferences and to analyze  traffic trends on our site.
