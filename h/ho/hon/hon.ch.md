# Health On the Net Foundation's Privacy policy

### Introduction

The Health On the Net Foundation (HON) is committed to honoring and respecting the privacy and anonymity of the individuals using its website(s) and/or services. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform the individuals about what information HON collects, why the Foundation collects this information, how it is used and how it is protected. This privacy policy applies to all the websites and services owned and/or managed by HON (listed below). 

This privacy policy is reviewed regularly to reflect HON's current practices. 

### Collection of personal information and limitations

HON collects personal information only when it is voluntarily provided for a particular service. The information collected primarily concerns communication details, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses. For the HONcode certification process, the webmaster might provide a login/password in order to access any restricted areas. While personal information is requested mainly during the HONcode certification process, it is also requested of those users submitting a complaint or giving feedback, subscribing to our newsletters, participating in a survey and/or applying for another service we provide. 

Any personal information voluntarily provided to HON by users and visitors of HON's websites is kept in the strictest confidence. This information is stored in the HON database. Only HON staff members, and only for the duration of their contracts, have access to the information stored in HON databases. Personal information provided voluntarily is used only for the purposes for which it was provided. HON asks individuals to explicitly consent to their personal information being used for any other reason than the one provided for.

### Right to verify and have your personal data deleted

You have the right to ask to have access to and verify any personal information HON may hold about you to ensure that it is accurate, as provided by law. To protect your privacy, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to, or making corrections to, your personal information. You may opt out altogether of having us collect, use, or disclose your personal information at any time, subject to reasonable notice and applicable laws. 

If you wish to withdraw from any of our services, please contact us via [https://www.hon.ch/20-years/en/contact.html](https://www.hon.ch/en/contact.html)

Please note that communication details cannot be completely deleted during HONcode certification. They can only be replaced and updated.

### Personal data storage and deletion

The information collected by HON will be removed from HON databases upon your request and when any relationship with HON through the services offered has been terminated. 

However, a copy of the personal information collected during HONcode certification will be stored and will be permanently deleted within two years after the removal of the HONcode file from the HONcode database. 

### Disclosure of information to third parties

HON does not share, rent, sell or trade any personal information with any third party. All personal information is kept confidential, unless explicitly agreed otherwise or if otherwise provided by law. No third parties have access to the HON database.

### Collection of anonymous data

HON collects anonymous data for different services and purposes. This data can be used for technical, statistical and research purposes. HON ensures that all information shared remains anonymous. The anonymous data is subject use in scientific publications. 

Anonymous data (including URL addresses and abstracts copied from certified websites and similar information) is collected for all HONcode certified websites and/or for websites that are included in a search engine managed by HON. The impersonal information collected will also be used for research purposes. 

By participating in a survey, you consent to HON collecting your personal information (if asked for). When we publish information, we do not disclose any personal information. If the publication includes any identifying details such as your name and address, we will ask for your explicit permission. 

Anonymous data is always collected when someone visits a HON website so that we might analyze how users use the website and improve our websites and services. For further information, see below under [Cookies / Google Analytics](https://www.hon.ch/en/privacy-policy.html#cookies). 

### The HONcode seal

HON has developed a dynamic and active HONcode seal which allows for the recording of a website's status in real-time according its compliance with the HONcode principles. This seal shows the last date the website was reviewed and is automatically updated after every review or audit. The seal collects only impersonal information such as your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, etc. which cannot be used to identify you personally. We do not sell, transmit, share or divulge this information to any third party and it is safely stored on the HON Web servers and used only by the HON collaborators and system manager to improve our services.

### Google Analytics

The HON website uses Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the site. This tool uses cookies - text files placed on a computer - to collect standard Internet log information as well as visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the website (including the IP address) is transmitted to Google. The information is then used to evaluate visitor's use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity. 

We will never (and will not allow any third party to ever) use this statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of the visitors of the HON site. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. We won't link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of the computer user. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any Personally Identifiable Information from any other source, unless you explicitly provide this information to us.

You can set your browser not to accept HON cookies. Disabling the cookies does not affect navigation on the HON website. 

[Learn more about Google Analytics Privacy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html).

We decided to anonymize the IP for Google Analytics, changing the last IP information in memory shortly after being sent to the Analytics Collection Network. The full IP address is never written to disk in this case.
