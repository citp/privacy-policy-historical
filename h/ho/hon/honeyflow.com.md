# BeeInventive's Privacy Policy - Flow Hive - Flow

_Last updated: February 10th 2017_

BeeInventive Pty Ltd  ACN: 161 952 941 (operator and licensee of the Flow brand, subsequently referred to as “we”) is subject to current Australian privacy legislation. We believe that the compliance with the Australian privacy legislation makes us also compliant with the EU and the US data and privacy protection rules. 

We fully respect the confidentiality of your information and take your privacy very seriously. In line with applicable legislation we explain in this privacy policy

  * why we need your personal information and what types of information we collect from you;
  * how we make sure your personal information remains safe and secure;
  * how you can contact us to find out more about your personal information.



## Why we need your personal information?

In this Privacy Policy, personal information is any information that could identify or be used to establish your identity. We collect your personal information so that we may fulfil your orders, advise you of the latest developments in our business and create a vibrant bee keeping community.

We engage in design, development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of Flow Hives and other bee keeping equipment. We mainly collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information so that we can design, manufacture and deliver our products to you.

We may use your personal information to keep you informed about the latest offers related to our products, bee keeping related activities and bee keeping educational resources. You can opt out of receiving direct marketing information from us at any time.

## What types of personal information do we collect?

We may ask for a range of personal information to assist us in delivering our products to you and collecting payments from you. The information we may request includes (but is not limited to) name, address, date of birth, contact details, email address, credit and debit card details. We gather all your personal information through the internet forms and subscribe buttons.

If you wish to remain anonymous or to use a pseudonym when dealing with us, we may be able to provide you with limited information, such as general details about our products. However, in many cases it will be impracticable for us to assist you if you wish to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym. For example, we will not be able to deliver our products to you if you do not provide us with your personal details. 

## How do we protect your personal information?

We hold your personal information in a computer storage facility and take steps to store them securely. We take a number of steps to protect personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or improper disclosure. These include instructing our staff who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of individuals.

From time to time we may share your personal information with other entities, some of them may be located, or have operations in, other countries. Such countries include the United States of America, Canada, the Netherlands and Hong Kong. We require any external organisation with whom we share your personal information to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles.

We aim to hold the personal information correct and up to date. If we believe the information we hold is incomplete or out of date, we may seek to correct or complete our records from other sources. Alternatively, you can alter the information we hold by contacting customer service department.

We may be legally required to maintain some of your records for a significant period of time. However, once we believe information is not longer needed we may remove any identifying details or destroy the records entirely.

  * seek more information about anything contained in this policy, or to request a copy of this policy in a different format;

We are permitted to refuse you access to the personal information in certain situations. Examples include where:

(ii) giving access would be likely to prejudice the taking of appropriate action in relation to the matter;

  * giving access is likely to interfere with law enforcement activities.
