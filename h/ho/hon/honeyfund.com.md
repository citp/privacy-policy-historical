During registration, we require members to give us basic contact information (such as your and your future spouse's first names, last names and e-mail addresses), wedding and honeymoon information (such as your wedding date and preferred honeymoon destination) and demographic information (such as your zip or postal code). Registration information is collected via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol (https). The information requested on the registration form may change from time to time. Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked "required" is necessary for registration and utilization of our services.

Users who give gifts to Honeyfund.com members are not required to register. However, some information is collected during the "Give a Gift" process, including first and last name and e-mail address. This information is associated with the member's account. The e-mail address collected during the “Give a Gift” process is kept private and not shared with third parties. It is used by Honeyfund.com, Inc. to communicate with the gift giver regarding their gift. 

We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of 18. Honeyfund services are available only to persons who are 18 years of age and over. If we learn that a user is under the age of 18, we will terminate the account and delete the user's information.
