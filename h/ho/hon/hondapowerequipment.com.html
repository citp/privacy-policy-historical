The DAA website allows you to opt-out of one or more interest-based advertising networks. Opt-outs are device and browser specific; therefore, you will need to set your opt-out preferences for each device and browser. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences; however, the DAA offers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/PMC" class="ui-link">browser extensions</a> that help preserve the opt-out preferences you set on the DAA's Consumer Choice Page. Please note that opt-outs only apply to interest-based advertising. You may still receive other types of online advertising.</p>

                <b>Browser Do Not Track Signals</b>
            </p>
            <p>Some browsers have a “do not track” setting that allows you to tell sites that you do not want to be tracked. At this time, our Sites do not treat browsers that send a “do not track” signal differently from browsers that do not send one. You may, however, opt-out of interest-based advertising as outlined above.</p>
