Honeybadger encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Honeybadger so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Honeybadger is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Honeybadger website.

 

## Use of your Personal Information

Honeybadger collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.

 

Honeybadger may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Honeybadger and its affiliates. Honeybadger may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

 

Honeybadger does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.

 

Honeybadger may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Honeybadger, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

 

Honeybadger may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Honeybadger, in order to determine what Honeybadger services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Honeybadger to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

## Use of Cookies

The Honeybadger website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Honeybadger pages, or register with Honeybadger site or services, a cookie helps Honeybadger to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Honeybadger website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Honeybadger features that you customized.

 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Honeybadger services or websites you visit.

 

## Security of your Personal Information

Honeybadger secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

 

## Children Under Thirteen

Honeybadger does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website.

 

## Opt-Out & Unsubscribe

We respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving announcements of certain information. Users may opt-out of receiving any or all communications from Honeybadger by contacting us at support@honeybadger.io.

 

## Changes to this Statement

Honeybadger will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Honeybadger encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Honeybadger is protecting your information.
