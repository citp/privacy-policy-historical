However, we may decline requests that are unreasonable, prohibited by law, or are not required to be honored by applicable law.

If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations. You may also send requests about your contact preferences, changes to your information including requests to opt-out of sharing your personal information with third parties by emailing [support@honeybadger.io](mailto:support@honeybadger.io).

There are many ways through which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms (for example, "Do Not Track") can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and, while we and others give you choices described in this Statement, we do not currently honor these mechanisms.

## Security of your Personal Information

Honeybadger takes reasonable steps to help secure your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, use, alteration, destruction, or disclosure.

## Transfers of Your Personal Information

Personal information we collect may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We maintain primary data centers in the United States. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Statement is processed according to the provisions of this Statement and applicable law wherever the data is located.

When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, in an effort to help ensure your rights and protections.

## For EU Users - Your European Privacy Rights

We adhere to applicable data protection laws in the European Economic Area, which, if applicable to you, includes the following rights:

  * If we are processing personal information based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent at any time for future processing;
  * You have a right to request access to, rectification, or erasure of your personal information, or to transfer or receive a copy of your personal information in a usable format;
  * You have a right to object to the processing of your personal information under certain circumstances; and
  * You have a right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.



## For EU Users - Privacy Shield

Honeybadger complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Honeybadger has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction over Honeybadger's compliance with the Privacy Shield. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

Our participation in Privacy Shield applies to personal data that is received from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. We will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles in respect of all such personal data.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss Privacy Shield Principles, Honeybadger commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first [contact us](mailto:support@honeybadger.io). Honeybadger has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-U.S. and Swiss Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism free of charge to you through [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield). Finally, you may have the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints, as described in [Annex I](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction) to the Privacy Shield Principles.

If we transfer your personal information to a third party agent or service provider for processing, we remain potentially liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if our third party agent or service provider processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and this causes you harm, unless we are able to show that we are not responsible for the event leading to that harm.

## Storage and Retention of Your Personal Information

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide services requested by you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria used to determine retention include:

  1. _How long is the personal information needed to provide applicable services?_ This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of the services, enabling system security measures, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.
  2. _Do users provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?_ In such cases, we may maintain the data until actively deleted by the user.
  3. _Is the personal information of a sensitive type?_ If so, a shortened retention time may be appropriate.
  4. _Are we subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data?_ Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.



## Changes to This Statement

Honeybadger will occasionally update this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we make any changes to this Statement, we will change the "Last Updated" date above or by providing such notice about or obtaining consent to changes as may be required by applicable law. Honeybadger encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Honeybadger is protecting your information.
