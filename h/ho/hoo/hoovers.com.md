# Hoover's Online - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**  
Hoover's, Inc., is serious about protecting your privacy -- whether you are a subscriber to our premium service or a visitor to our free information. We use information collected about you only to process orders and to make Hoover's Online a more useful and valuable service. Hoover's strives to respect the privacy of those who visit or become members of the Hoover's Online Web site. 

The policy listed below is applicable to Hoover's Online and other sites on the World Wide Web that are maintained and operated by Hoover's, Inc. (such as Hoover's IPO Central and Hoover's StockScreener).  
  
  
**Your Information: What, How, and Why?**  
 **Members**   
When you subscribe to Hoover's Online, any information sent to us via our membership form is secure. In order to process your request, we need to know basic contact information such as your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and method of payment. All required information is kept in-house and is not shared with third parties, except in cases where special promotions are offered through a Hoover's partner. Optional information that we may request is kept in-house. We request this information from subscribers so that we can add relevant features to Hoover's Online. 

**Members and Visitors**   
As a member of or visitor to a Hoover's site, you may voluntarily sign up for one of our free newsletters ([Hoover's Online: Week at a Glance](https://web.archive.org/hoov/newsletters/) or [Hoover's IPO Update](https://web.archive.org/hoov/ipo/features/survey/ipoupdate.html)). When you sign up for one of the newsletters, we ask for the usual contact information, such as your name and e-mail address. We also ask for particular demographic information, which is used to help us understand our audience so that we can continue to provide appropriate content. This information is for Hoover's use only and is not disclosed to any other party except in aggregate form. Additionally, if you decide that you do not wish to receive a newsletter or update any longer, you are given the freedom to cancel your participation. We provide the appropriate contact information in each issue. 

Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our Hoover's Online visitors. From time to time, we request your input in order to evaluate potential features and services for Hoover's Online. We might invite you to participate in a survey that is posted on the Web. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We might also e-mail a survey to you now and again, but even in this case, answering it is completely voluntary. We are able to get your e-mail address for a survey if in the past you have signed up for a service or newsletter through Hoover's Online. We do not employ special tools or try to find any e-mail addresses that are not provided to us by the individual. 

**How Do We Protect Member Information Once We Have It?**   
For members of Hoover's Online, all information is stored on a secure server. Hoover's Online uses Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server for our Web site. Browsers will encrypt the contents of the subscription form before sending it to our server. Each time you enter your user name and password, your browser will encrypt the password before it sends it to our server. Surveys sent out to members and non-members are also secure. 

Please remember that with the exception of membership to Hoover's Online, all other transactions are performed by our business partners. The technology being used for these third-party transactions is not ours. Our privacy policy and our security or common practices cannot be transferred to other companies.  
  
  
**Cookies You Can't Eat**  
 **What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?**   
A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser. Hoover's Online uses cookies to store some personal preferences for your future visits to Hoover's Online. 

If you use the "Password Saver" feature, or access Hoover's Online through a Business License, we store the information needed to grant you access in a cookie. Cookies allow Hoover's to recognize you more quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site is more personalized and productive. You'll find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Web sites in much the same way we use them here at Hoover's. 

We know of no way that our cookies could present a security risk to you. Under present technology, no Web server can get a cookie stored by another Web server. Hoover's Online currently does not use cookies to gather information about you or your movements through our site. You can learn everything there is to know about cookies on http://www.cookiecentral.com/ . 

**Will We Disclose Your Personal Information to Outside Parties?**   
It is not our current policy to sell lists containing detailed personal customer information. From time to time, however, Hoover's may offer special promotions through a partner. If you take advantage of a special offer, you are authorizing Hoover's to provide only that partner with the relevant information needed to fulfill the offer. You become a customer of that partner, and are therefore under the guidelines of that partner's privacy policy. If this is of concern to you, be sure to check the privacy policy of that particular partner before you respond to the offer. 

While visiting Hoover's Online, you may decide to purchase a product or service through one of our provider partners. Some of these partners and their products are featured in the [Purchasing Center](https://web.archive.org/store/0,1334,13_1195,00.html), and you will find others throughout the site. In these cases, even if it appears that you are still on a Hoover's branded site, please understand that you are under the guidelines of the third party's privacy policy, if they have one. We cannot in any way make guarantees or warranties as to the exact nature of a third party's use of your personal information. 

In order to make Hoover's Online a more valuable product for our subscribers and visitors, we also collect and analyze statistical information. From time to time, we share this information in aggregate with a third party. However, this data is reported only in aggregate and reveals no personal details about individual visitors to our site. This information is distributed only to help attract appropriate advertisers for the Hoover's Online site.  
  
  
**In Summary**  
Hoover's, Inc., is committed to protecting your privacy. Personal information that we collect about you stays within Hoover's, Inc., and any information distributed to third parties is reported in aggregate only. We do not give or sell your information to people who want to send you junk e-mail.  
  
  
**Your Consent**  
By using our Web site and signing up for Hoover's Online services, you consent to the collection and use of the previously mentioned information by Hoover's, Inc. This policy is subject to change.
