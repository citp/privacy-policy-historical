			<p>Hooktheory.com is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you have a positive experience on our website.  We know that you care how information about you is used and shared. We value your trust, and we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is managed carefully and sensibly.</p> 

			<p>This privacy policy describes our practices for handling both non-identifying and identifying (i.e., “personal”) information, including online and offline data. This policy applies only to the hooktheory.com website. Please note that BY VISITING HOOKTHEORY.COM, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY</p>

			<!--<h4>What non-identifying information does Hooktheory collect?</h4>



			<p>We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your domain name (but not your e-mail address), aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, computer settings or most-recently visited URL. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for example, filling out a survey or user registration form.  </p> -->

			<h2>What is "personal information"?  What personal information does Hooktheory collect?</h2>

			<p>"Personal information" is information that others, like hooktheory.com, can use to identify you.  To create your user account at hooktheory.com, you will need to provide information that identifies you so that we can ensure that others cannot access your hooktheory.com account. You will be asked to provide only your e-mail address.<!--, gender and ZIP code, and ________________. <i>[Hooktheory alter this to match the final version of the site]</i>--></p>

			<p>Please note that Hooktheory does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected such information we will delete it from our library.  Children aged 13 or older should not submit any personal information without the permission of their parents or guardians. By using hooktheory.com, you are representing that you are at least 18, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents' permission to use the service. <!--<i>[Hooktheory should include a flag for this age issue at the creation of every account, i.e., asking for client’s age, then noting this access policy.  Some sites actually require some evidence of parental consent for the 13 – 18 year olds, e.g., entering credit card or driver’s license info.  Others just use the honor system and take the risk that a parent didn’t give consent, which might result in certain transactions being voided, and possible liability for collecting information from these minors.]</i> --></p>
