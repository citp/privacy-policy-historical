**3.          _Personal Information We Share With Others_**

Hooters does not sell your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties.

Hooters may share your personal information with parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (Hooters of America Companies, or “HOA Companies”), as well as with Hooters franchisees. Hooters requires these entities to comply fully with this Privacy Policy. Subject to applicable legal restrictions, the HOA Companies may share your Personal Information with each other to make sure your experience is as seamless as possible, and you have the full benefit of what Hooters has to offer. For example, if you select a Hooters franchise as your favorite Hooters location, that franchisee may be provided with Personal Information such as your contact information and birthday, in order to make special offers to you.

Hooters may share your Personal Information with non-HOA companies that perform services on our behalf, as necessary for them to perform those services. HOA requires those non-HOA companies to have reasonable safeguards in place to protect any Personal Information they may receive in a manner consistent with applicable law. Further, Hooters may share information collected by cookies and other automated means with sites you link to from the Sites or Mobile App, or social media providers (such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+) that you visit by clicking through from our Sites or Mobile App. Please note that while Hooters does not capture or store your login information or any other personally identifiable information for Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks, their websites may store session information or cookies on your computer or wireless phone.

In Other Circumstances: Other than as noted above, we may provide Personal Information to non-HOA companies or other third parties for purposes such as:

  * Complying with court orders and other legal processes;
  * To assist with identity verification, and to prevent fraud and identity theft;
  * Selling HOA Companies’ assets, or in process of arranging for the dissolution of the HOA Companies through bankruptcy; or
  * Enforcing our agreements and property rights.



**4.          _Anonymous & Aggregate Information_**

Hooters also collects some Personal Information on an anonymous basis, and/or anonymizes the Personal Information we collect about you. We obtain aggregate data by combining anonymous data that meet certain criteria into groups. When we employ non-HOA companies to anonymize or aggregate data on our behalf, Hooters requires those non-HOA companies to protect any Personal Information they may receive in a manner consistent with this Policy. We may share aggregate or anonymous information in various formats with trusted non-HOA companies, and may work with those entities to do research and provide products and services.

**5.          _Our Online Privacy Policy for Children_**

The Sites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13, and the Mobile App is designed to be used only by persons above 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifying information from anyone under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a visitor under the age of 13, we will delete the information from our records. A child’s parent or legal guardian can request that Personal Information of their child be deleted from our records, if it has not been already. To make such a request, please contact us at the contact points provided below.

**6.          _Safeguarding Your Personal Information_**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take reasonable steps to help ensure the privacy and security of your Personal Information. We have implemented encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect Personal Information when stored or transmitted by Hooters. We require non-HOA companies acting on our behalf to have reasonable safeguards in place to protect any Personal Information they may receive in a manner consistent with applicable law.

However, you understand and agree that such steps do not guarantee that use of the Sites is invulnerable to all security breaches, and that Hooters makes no warranty, guarantee, or representation that use of any of our Sites is protected from viruses, security threats or other vulnerabilities.

There are several measures you can take to protect your Personal Information. One option is simply not to volunteer it to us. The Federal Trade Commission’s site, www.ftc.gov, also offers useful information about how to protect personally-identifiable information provided online or through mobile applications.

**7.          _Links to Other Sites_**

We may offer links to sites or to social media providers that are not operated by Hooters. If you visit one of these linked sites, or access social media from our Sites or Mobile App, you should review the privacy and other policies of those other sites.

Please note that several third-party sites have limited licenses to use Hooters’ trademarks, but that those sites are not operated by Hooters. For example, there are independent companies who sell Hooters-branded products, process Hooters job applications, take entries into Hooters sweepstakes, and/or sell Hooters gift cards. We are not responsible for the policies and practices of other companies, and any personal information you submit to those companies online is subject to their websites’ privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.

**8.          _Social Media and Personal Information_**
