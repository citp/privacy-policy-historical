HoodaMath.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. Hooda Math is intended to provide fun and educational resources for kids and teens to use under the guidance of their parents and teachers. As required by The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), we provide this privacy policy to inform parents and legal guardians (collectively, “Parents”) about our privacy practices on our site www.hoodamath.com. 
</p>
<p>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. We use this information to help us design a website that is targeted to the interests of our visitors. We do not tie any personal information to your IP address.
</p>
<p>
Hooda Math uses cookies to track game progress and level completion. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
</p>
<p>
We employ or our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
Advertisers
</p>
<p>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. In response to the new COPPA rules, HoodaMath.com has opted out of behaviorally targeted ads from all of our advertising networks, and instead only shows contextually-based ads or other carefully-selected ads which are not based on a user's browsing behavior.
</p>
<p>
We have asked all of our advertising networks to turn off all behaviorally targeted ads that would track a user or attempt to create a profile on any of our users. We have also alerted our advertising agencies that a portion of our audience is "under 13" and that they need to adhere to all COPPA rules and regulations. Hooda Math does not run behaviorally targeted ads, but, if you want to opt out of these on other websites that do, you can opt out here: <a href="http://www.iab.net/privacymatters/">http://www.iab.net/privacymatters/</a>
