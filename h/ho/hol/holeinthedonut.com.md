I disclose

This blog accepts paid advertising and sponsorships, which are clearly disclosed and identified as such.

I am not compensated to provide opinion on products, services, websites and various other topics (sometimes referred to as pay-per-post). However I do participate in press trips and familiarization (fam) trips hosted by Convention and Visitor Bureaus and/or public relations firms representing destinations, which usually provide free accommodations, food, transportation, and other travel related services. I also regularly receive free entrance to tourist attractions and other travel related entities.

If I have received a complementary product or service, or a discount on anything I write about, I will always disclose this information. In addition, I’ll always give my honest opinion about any product or service I write about, regardless of whether or not I paid for it. The receipt and acceptance of complimentary items/services received will never influence the content, topics, or posts in this blog.

The views and opinions expressed on this blog are mine and mine alone. If I claim or appear to be an expert on a certain topic or product or service area, I will only endorse products or services that I believe, based on my expertise, are worthy of such endorsement. Any product claim, statistic, quote, or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer or provider.
