## What information do we ask for?

When you have searched for prices and availability and are ready to confirm your booking, we will ask for your name, your postal address,your fax number and e-mail address. We'll also need your credit/debit card details (including card number, cardholder name and expiry date) in order to take payment and confirm the booking on-line. If you're paying by debit card we may need to take the start date and issue number of the card.   
We ask you for your telephone number in case we need to contact you urgently regarding your booking.  


## How do we protect customer information?

All the information you give us is protected by a secure server. The secure server software SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. The information is only de-encrypted when it reaches our server. You can tell our site is secure as a small locked padlock will appear in the bottom left of your browser to show that you can safely send credit card details through our site. Another indicator is that our secure pages will not display a security alert message. 

We also have Firewall security software in place to protect our internal information from the Internet.

## Will Holiday Extras use my information for direct marketing? 

Yes, and we ask you for your permission first. We will primarily send you details of the products we offer,in addition we will send one email on the run up to your holiday with links to helpful 3rd party sites.If you have signed up to a special promotional prize draw, then you may be contacted by those subsidiary partners stated at the time of sign up or entry into the competition. If you find that you'd rather not have any contact with us, apart from that which is necessary for us to give you our normal level of service please [write to us](https://web.archive.org/about-us/contact-us.html "contact us page") or [unsubscribe online](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe.html "usubscribe from Holiday Extras email")

## Will Holiday Extras disclose any information to third parties?

Holiday Extras will only disclose your name and booking details to our suppliers (see above) for operational purposes. We will not pass on your details to other companies for their marketing purposes - unless you have signed up to a special promotional prize draw, then you may be contacted by those subsidiary partners stated at the time of sign up or entry into the competition. 

We won't disclose credit/debit card numbers unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
