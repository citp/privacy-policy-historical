    Hola Networks Ltd. ("Hola")
  </h1>
  <br><br>
  Effective:  May 2013<br><br>
  Respecting your privacy is critical to our business.  Hola Networks Limited ("Hola") is concerned about your privacy and we provide this privacy notice
  ("Notice") to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and data we receive from 
  users of the website we own and operate, namely www.hola.org and the other services, features, content and applications offered by us on the website
  ("Services"). This Notice applies only to information collected through the Services.<br><br>
  By using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Notice, as such Notice may be amended from time to time.  Each time 
  you use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Notice. <br><br> 
  To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Notice, we mean information about you that is personally
  identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, billing information, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this
  personal information.  When we use the phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Notice, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your
  Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of 
  individual persons.<br><br>
  IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE SERVICES FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER REGION WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION,
  USE, AND DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM THE LAWS OF ISRAEL ("HOLA LOCALE") LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE GOVERNED 
  BY HOLA LOCALE LAW, THIS PRIVACY NOTICE, AND OUR TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO HOLA LOCALE AND YOU CONSENT TO THAT TRANSFER.
  ADDITIONALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO AND PROCESSED IN COUNTRIES  WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION
  MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN YOUR COUNTRY.
  
  <h2>Contact Hola / Abuse reports</h2>
  If you believe that your privacy has been compromised by any person, in the course of using the Services, please contact Hola at: privacy@hola.org

  <h2>The Information We Gather</h2>
  We collect information about you in a number of ways:
  <ul>
    <li><u>We collect and maintain information that you voluntarily submit to us </u>during your use of the Services. For example: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>when you register for the Services, you may provide us certain information including your name, email address, physical address, screen 
      name and/or password, billing information or other information we may require;</li>
      <li>if you elect  to register for a certain feature or function we may collect information from you; and</li>
      <li>if you purchase a product or service through the Services, we or  a third party vendor may collect payment and/or credit card information on our behalf.</li>
      <li>You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may stop you from gaining access to the Services or limit the features that you can use.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><u>You may request data deletion</u>.  You may request that any personal data we receive from you be deleted from our database.  Please review the section
      below on Your Choices for further information on data deletion. </li>
    <li><u>As you use the Services, certain information may also be passively collected</u>. Through technologies like cookies, pixels, beacons and log files, we may
      collect information about how you use the Services. Please see the sections below on Cookies and Log Data for more information. </li>
    <li><u>We may receive information from third parties.</u> For example, we may receive Personal Information about you from a social networking website.  In such a case,
      the third party will notify you that we will have access to your information and the policy that governs our use of your information (e.g., their privacy policy or ours.)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  We will use your Personal Information in the ways described below or described at the time that the information is collected.
  <ul>
    <li><u>In general, we use your Personal Information as necessary or appropriate to:</u></li>
      <ul>
        <li>provide you with customer support;</li>
	<li>register you and provide you access to the Services;</li>
	<li>perform the Services; </li>
	<li>respond to your inquiries or requests that you direct to us;</li>
	<li>send communications and administrative emails about the Services;</li>
	<li>personalize and better tailor the features, performance and support of the Services for your use;</li>
	<li>provide you with opportunities and functionality that we think would be of particular interest to you;</li>
	<li>improve the quality of the Services, and</li>
	<li>analyze, benchmark and conduct research on, user data and user interactions with the Services</li>
      </ul>
    <li><u>Log Data.</u>  When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information from your device ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include 
    information such as your computer's Internet protocol address (more commonly known as an IP address), browser type, the webpages you visit, the time 
    spent on those pages, access times and dates, and other statistics as well as the unique identifier for your computer, mobile phone or any other 
    electronic device used to access the Services. We use this information to enhance our services, to increase their functionality and user-friendliness, 
    and to better tailor them to the needs of our users and to provide better service to other users. We also use this information to verify that visitors
    to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with 
    other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information.</li>
    <li><u>Cookies:</u> Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your browser for
    record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we may utilize persistent cookies to save your registration information. Second, we
    utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate
    usage and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services
    and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by
    changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, 
    however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Services.  Any Personal Information gathered through the use of cookies is 
    subject to the same efforts to protect your privacy as outlined above.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Share and Disclose Information</h2>
  We know how important it is to keep the information you've entrusted to us confidential. We will not rent, sell or share your Personal Information with
  third parties except as specifically approved or under the circumstances described below. If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information 
  collected about you in the ways identified in this Notice, you should not use the Services.
  <ul>
  <li><u>Users.</u> Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want Hola, other Hola users, and third parties to know about you.
  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and Personal Information and we encourage you to think carefully about what Personal Information you disclose 
  in your profile pages and in any forums or any other part of the Services.</li>
  <li><u>Service Providers.</u>  We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate or enhance our Services, to provide the Services on our
  behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Services) or to assist
  us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are 
  obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. </li>
  <li><u>Affiliate Site or Service.</u>  When you access a website or communicate with or use an application (mobile or otherwise) operated by any entity
  other than us (e.g., the iTunes App Store, a social networking site like Facebook or Twitter, one of our sponsors, venues or promoters), we call that 
  website or service an Affiliate Site or Service.   Unless we clearly indicate otherwise at the time of collection, we do not share Personal Information
  with Affiliate Sites or Service.  Please be aware however that our Affiliate Sites or Service may collect information about you.  By the mere virtue of 
  your presence on the Affiliate Site or Service, the Affiliate Site or Service may be able to collect information about you and/or the way you interact 
  with the Affiliate Site or use the Affiliate Service.  These might include for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity.  There may
  be a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page.  Any Personal Information that you provide when you sign up at any co-branded page may be
  collected by, or shared with, our third party Affiliate. Please see the Affiliate Site’s privacy policy to better understand what information is collected,
  how it is used and shared, and your choices regarding control.  </li>
  <li><u>Aggregated, Anonymous Information.</u>  We may share aggregated Anonymous Information about you with third parties. Aggregated information is your
  Anonymous Information that is combined with the Anonymous Information of other users and does not allow you to be identified or contacted. Depending on the
  circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregated information, or limit the third parties' use of the aggregated information.</li>
  <li><u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</u> We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties
  as we in good faith believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to comply with applicable
  laws, to protect the property and rights of Hola, you or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we 
  may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</li>
  <li><u>Within our Company; Changes to our Company.</u>  We may share all or some of your Personal Information with any of our subsidiaries, joint ventures, 
  or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Notice.  Additionally, in the event we go through a business transition
  such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You
  acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Notice, and that any entity that acquires us, is merged with us or that acquires our assets
  may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Notice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children's Information</h2>
  The Services are not directed or intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from individuals under
  13 years of age.  No one under age 13 may provide any Personal Information to or on the Services. If you are under 13 years of age, you should not register or provide
  Personal Information through the Services.  If we later obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal
  Information from our systems. If you are the parent or guardian of a child whom you believe has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at info@hola.org 
  so that we may delete and remove such child's information from our systems.<br><br>
  We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the internet 
  and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices.<br><br>
  If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us via email at info@hola.org.  
  
  <h2>Social Media and Online Engagement </h2>
  We use a variety of technologies and social media options to communicate and interact with our users. These sites and applications include popular social networking
  and media sites, open source software communities and more. To better engage the public in ongoing dialog, we use several third-party platforms including, but not
  limited to, Facebook and Twitter. "Third-Party Websites and Applications" are Web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by us. When
  interacting with the Hola presence on those websites, you may reveal certain Personal Information to us or to third parties. 

  <h2>Ad Networks and Third Party Cookies</h2>
  We may have agreements with companies, sometimes called "Ad Networks" that serve advertising on the Services on behalf of third parties. These Ad Networks may place
  or recognize a "third party cookie," on your browser. Ad Networks use cookies to understand Web usage patterns of people who see advertisements, to control the sequence
  of advertisements you see, to provide you with the most relevant advertising, and to make sure you don't see the same ad too many times. Ad Networks may connect
  information about pages you visit through our Services with information about pages you visit on other sites and show you advertising based on this combined information.
  We do not control Ad Networks or what they do with the information they collect. Many Ad Networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and abide by NAI 
  principles, which prohibit members from connecting Personal Information to information they collect through cookies without your explicit consent. If you wish to opt out
  of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI member Ad Networks, please go to the NAI Opt-Out [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp] site
  and follow the instructions on that site. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements from NAI member Ad Networks, but the advertising will not be tailored to
  your web preferences and usage patterns.
  
  <h2>Security and Data Retention</h2>
  Hola is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from 
  unauthorized access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically 
  stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Services in the most
  expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to
  determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the Internet,
  we make commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of such information consistent with this Notice and all applicable laws and regulations. <br><br>
  We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws and your
  consent to such purpose remains valid after termination of our relationship with you.    

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  Remember, you have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Information:
  <ul>
    <li><u>Limit the Personal Data You Provide.</u> If you choose not to provide any Personal Information or limit the Personal Information you provide, you may not be 
      able to use certain Services. </li>
    <li><u>Opt-Out.</u>  When you supply us with Personal Information, from time-to-time, in our discretion, you may be asked to indicate whether you are interested in
      receiving information from us about special offers in connection with the Services, and/or our advertisers and partners. Unless you opt-out to receive such 
      communications, we may, from time to time, send you marketing communications.<br><br>
      At any time, you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by clicking on your email preferences and following the instructions to
      "manage your email alerts." You may modify your choices at any time.  Also, in any promotional email we send, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving
      such messages in the future by clicking on the link at the bottom of the email that says "unsubscribe." It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request.
      Even if you have unsubscribed from receiving promotional emails from us, we may send you other types of important e-mail communications without offering you the opportunity
      to opt out of receiving them. These may include customer service announcements, administrative notices and surveys.<br><br>
      Please note that changing information in registration account or opting out of receiving promotional email communications will affect only future communications from us.
      If we already provided your information to a third party (such as a sponsor or affiliate) before you changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to 
      change your preferences directly with that third party as well.</li>
    <li><u>Changing or Deleting Your Information.</u>  You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your profile by changing the applicable
      information in your account settings.  Keep in mind, however, that even if you delete information from your profile, we may retain your Personal Information in 
      conformance with our data retention policy and there may be residual Personal Information that remains within our databases, access logs, and other records. In 
      addition, we are not responsible for updating or removing your Personal Information contained in the lists or databases of third parties who have been provided 
      information as permitted by this Notice.</li>
   </ul>

  <h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
  In the United States, under California’s "Shine the Light" law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an
  established business relationship (1) a list of the categories of Personal Information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to
  that customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year
  for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and (2) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please email us at privacy@hola.org.

  to be your continued acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Notice, as amended. We encourage you to bookmark this Web page and review this Notice regularly.<br><br>
