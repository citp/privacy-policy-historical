## Privacy Policy And Stuff

####  Our Commitment To Privacy 

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

####  The Information We Collect 

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Hollywood Camera Work website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: Name, Address, Email address, Phone number and Credit/Debit Card Information. If you enter other people's information, such as in a Ship To field, their information is collected as well. Your Name/Address information is stored indefinitely. Your Credit Card information is stored for a few days under the highest encryption for fraud detection and credit card verification purposes, and is then automatically purged. 

####  The Way We Use Information 

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order, and for a small number of specific follow-up communications as described below. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses primarily to answer the email we receive. Your email address is not shared with any outside party. We will not send marketing emails to you except upon the launch of a new Hollywood Camera Work product, or if there's an important matter you need to be aware of, and only if you're an existing customer or if you have signed up for a specific notification. If an order is placed, our system additionally schedules a number of follow-up emails, which will be sent to your email address after a delay. Our intention is to send as little email as possible. Any unscheduled email contains a removal link that will permanently prevent any further email communication, unless you place an order, in which case, this block needs to be removed. 

####  User Tracking 

We use Google Analytics to monitor site usage, so that we may optimize the layout for ease of use and higher relevance, and fine-tune our advertising spending and search engine ranking. No personal information is collected, except if you place an order, in which case, your path prior to placing an order can be analyzed -- we use this as part of our credit card fraud detection. 

####  Our Commitment To Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We are in the process of becoming PCI Compliant, which is a Payment Card Industry certification program that requires merchants to have the highest standards of data security.
