Hola VPN Ltd. ("Hola", "we," or "us") is the owner of the website Hola.org ("the Site"), the Hola software ("the Software") and any accompanying services, features, content, and applications offered by us (collectively referred herein as "the Services"). We are concerned about your privacy and have designed this Privacy Policy in order to help you decide whether to use the Services. By accessing and using the Services, or providing information to us in other formats, you agree and accept the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time and consent to the collection and use of information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy carefully and to periodically refer to it so that you understand it and any subsequent changes made to it.  
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP USING THE SERVICES IMMEDIATELY AND UNINSTALL WHERE RELEVANT. 

### What types of information do we collect?

We collect the following types of data from you when you use the Services: 

  * Log Data: Log data may include the following information- browser type, web pages you visit, time spent on those pages, access times and dates.

The Personal Information we may collect and retain includes your IP address, your name and email address, screen name, payment and billing information or other information we may ask from time to time as will be required for the on-boarding process and services provisioning. When you create an account on the Services you are able to do so by using your credentials with a designated third party website or service ("Third Party Account") such as Gmail®. Doing so will enable you to link your account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, a Third Party Account pop-up box will appear that you will need to approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the types of information that we will obtain. This information includes your Personal Information stored on your Third Party Account, such as user-name, email address, profile picture, birth date, gender and preferences. Any Anonymous Information that is specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information, is treated by us as Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage exists.

At all times, we will abide by the terms, conditions and restrictions of the social network platform. 



### How do we use your information?

We use your information in order to provide you with the Service.
