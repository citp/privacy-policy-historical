# Holland America Line Inc. - Privacy Policy

privacy policy

The following information explains our policy regarding any personal information you may supply to us when visiting our Web site (site). By using this site, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy Policy.

1\. CONFIDENTIALITY   
Your confidential use of this site cannot be guaranteed by us. We shall not be responsible for any harm that you or any person may suffer as a result of a breach of confidentiality in respect to your use of this site.

2\. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY   
If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and your password. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You understand that you are financially responsible for all uses of this site by you and those using your login information. 

3\. USE OF IP ADDRESSES   
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Holland America collects IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, and to audit the use of our site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms and conditions or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

4\. COOKIES   
Holland America may use "cookies" to make our service more effective. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our server. It allows our server to recognize whether you have visited our site before thereby saving you the need to provide information that we have already received from you. If you would prefer not receiving cookies, most Web browsers offer menu options allowing you to disable them.

5\. SECURITY   
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information that you provide us is of great concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Holland America cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us; in other words, you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use our reasonable best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. Most information you provide to our site is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us.

6\. MONITORING   
Holland America reserves the right to monitor and review any information transmitted or received through this site and sensor, edit, remove or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any information that Holland America, in its sole discretion, deems inappropriate or a violation of these terms and conditions.

7\. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE US   
During your use of our site, you may provide us with personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information) for the purpose of making reservations, requesting information or for other reasons. Holland America does not sell the personal information of our users to third parties. Holland America may use the information it gathers for its own internal purposes and may share your information with other companies within the Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc group of companies. Holland America's goal in collecting personal information online is to continually improve the content of our site and to offer consumers products that best meet your preferences and desires. Holland America and other companies within the Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc group of companies may use the personal data you provide online to send or otherwise provide you with information about new products and services, or about offers that we feel may be of interest to you. As explained below, you may opt out of this service as to Holland America. 

8\. INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TRAVEL AGENCIES   
We may ask you to identify a travel agency that you work with. If you provide us with the name of your travel agency, we may share other information that you provided us with that agency. For example, if you told us that you were interested in a certain cruise product, we may tell your travel agency so they can discuss this directly with you. Travel agencies are not owned or controlled by Holland America. Consequently, we cannot tell you what travel agencies may do with information that we provide to them.

9\. INFORMATION GIVEN TO OTHER TRAVEL PROVIDERS   
If you use our site to purchase a travel product that is offered by another travel provider (for example, air transportation, hotels or shore excursions), we will give the other travel provider the information they require in order to process and confirm your booking. We do not place limitations on these other travel providers as to their use of this information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of other travel providers if you have questions about their use of personal information.

10\. OTHER DISCLOSURES   
In addition to the circumstances described above, Holland America may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or court order, as requested by a government agency or by law enforcement authorities, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary to protect the safety of our passengers, employees or property.

11\. RIGHTS AS TO MATERIALS YOU PROVIDE   
By uploading or submitting any suggestions, ideas, comments, questions or other materials to us, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) us a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive and assignable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute and display such materials or incorporate such materials into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout the universe. In addition, you warrant that all so-called "moral rights" in those materials have been waived.
