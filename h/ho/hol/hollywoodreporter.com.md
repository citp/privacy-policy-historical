It explains how we collect information from users of the Websites and how we use such information. Your use of the Websites constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. Please also read our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20101230100409id_/http%3A//www.hollywoodreporter.com/legal/terms), which govern the basic operation of the Websites.

###  1\. The Information We Collect and Use

###  A. Non-Personally Identifiable Information

When you visit a Website, we may collect certain data that does not tell us specifically who you are. This is "Non-Personally Identifiable Information." It includes things like your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and the last domain you visited before coming to our Website or the domain you go to when you leave. It also includes various statistical data such as which pages you visit on our Websites, how long you stay on them, and what you click.

We may place a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our "preference" cookie expires after thirty (30) days. We may use cookies to keep track of your choice of language and home page preference; to understand your exposure to certain Internet advertisements as you use the Websites, and to gather usage data that will help us generally improve the quality of the Websites. There is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept cookies. You should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features on the Websites.

We also may use a small piece of code (sometimes referred to as "1x1 clear pixel," "Web beacon" or "clear GIF") placed in the pages of the Websites to help us gather additional information about which parts of the site receive the most visitors and other user traffic patterns, and enable us to administer the site.

No Personally Identifiable Information (see below) is collected through our cookies or Web beacons.

###  B. Personally Identifiable Information

We also may collect information that can be used to identify you ("Personally Identifiable Information"). We only collect Personally Identifiable Information when you specifically provide it to us. For example, in connection with your use of certain features of the Websites you may be asked to create a user account and provide certain information including your name, email addresses, address, and telephone number. You may also provide User Uploaded Information to the Websites, as described in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20101230100409id_/http%3A//www.hollywoodreporter.com/legal/terms), or you may provide information such as your credit card number in connection with the purchase of services or content available through the Websites. When you create a user account with an Prometheus Global media website and sign in to your account on the Websites or post User Uploaded Information, you are not anonymous to us.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information to fulfill your requests, respond to your inquiries and provide other services, and to alert you to information, offers, or publications in which we think you may be interested. The emails that we send contain links that enable you to “unsubscribe” from such mailings.

We do not sell Personally Identifiable Information or other information you make available to the Websites, or share such information with third parties, except as described below.

From time to time, we may partner with unaffiliated companies or individuals for market research, product development or similar purposes. These companies or individuals may be provided with access to Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information, but we will require by contract that they agree to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information. We also may subcontract with other companies and individuals to do work on our behalf; they may be provided with access to Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally Identifiable Information, but only as needed to perform their functions.

We may share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties, who may contact you to offer products and services. At any time, you can contact Prometheus Global Media at 1-800-658-8372 and [terms@prometheusgm.com](mailto:terms@e5globalmedia.com) to request that we not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties.

We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties in connection with a corporate transaction where all or a portion of our business (e.g., a portion that includes our customer lists) is sold or transferred. We also may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if disclosure is required by law or as part of a lawsuit or government investigation or proceeding, or in order to permit us to exercise or preserve our legal rights or take action regarding potentially illegal activities or to protect the safety of any person.

###  2\. Data Security
