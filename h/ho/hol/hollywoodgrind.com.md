**Hollywood Grind Privacy Policy – Last Updated February, 2009**

To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personal information you submit on Web pages where this policy is posted.

As we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with this site as a visitor from outside the United States, you will be asked during the initial registration to consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of your personally identifiable information, which includes the use of cookies as described below.

All other information is stored on our servers to identify information you gave us in filling out our forms, or by visiting our site, and is used internally only for statistics. Hollywood Grind does not, and will not, sell, or distribute, any information obtained.

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.
