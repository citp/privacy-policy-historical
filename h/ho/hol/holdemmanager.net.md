You always have the ability to decide whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information.

  * A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for information, in that MVS would be in breach of law were it to refuse to provide such information, and it or its officers, executive or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process; or, 
  * Where such disclosure is necessary for MVS to enforce its legal rights pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction from which such information was gathered, and there is a legal basis to do so.
