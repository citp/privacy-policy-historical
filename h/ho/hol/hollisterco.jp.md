Users under the age of 18 may not be permitted to use certain features of our Websites/Apps, such as click to chat and contact us. 

#### 1\. General Browsing

We collect general information about our visitors’ experience with our Websites/Apps and this general information is not connected to personally identifiable information about individual visitors. This general information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider or your IP address) will provide us with information regarding the general use of our Websites/Apps. The information collected includes which pages our visitors are viewing on our Websites/Apps and whether visitors arrived through a link for our Websites/Apps. It also includes information on the type of browser and service provider used. For visitors using a mobile version of our Websites, this includes technical information about the device used, such as screen size, cookies supported by the device, and how images may appear. All of this information helps us provide a better experience for our visitors by being able to determine such things as how to best format our mobile Websites/Apps for various devices, our most desired pages, products and features, how to best direct visitors to our Websites/Apps, and where there might be browser or service provider connection issues.

#### 2\. Location Information

Our Website, Apps, and communications may use your IP address to determine the approximate location of your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This allows us to tailor content to you, such as a map of nearby stores. Mobile devices include your cell phone, and could include your laptop or tablet depending on the type of wireless connectivity used. If you do not consent to provide or disable location-based services, we may ask you to manually select the region where you are located, or to enter your zip code; if you chose not to provide this information some features of the Websites, Apps or communications may not be available. See the “Opt-Out” section below for the choices you have regarding collection of location information.

#### 3\. Personal Data

#### Contact Us and Click to Chat

If you complete a general "Contact Us" form on one of our Websites we may collect your name, email address, and any information that you provide in the text of your message.

If you use the Click to Chat feature on our Websites we may collect your name and any additional personal data or other information that you provide throughout the communication.

#### Sign Up for Marketing Email List

If you sign up for our marketing email list, or the marketing email list for any of our affiliate brands, you will be asked to provide your email address. Our affiliate brands are: Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids. Signing up enables you to receive information about products and offers that we provide via email. Once you sign up you will receive an email to the email address you submitted confirming you are subscribed. In some locations on our Websites/Apps you are given the opportunity to submit additional information, such as gender and date of birth, that will help us cater messaging and marketing emails we send to you. In addition, we may identify you when you click a link in an email to get to our Websites, and may personalize messaging, promotions or product recommendations. You can choose the frequency with which you receive marketing emails or unsubscribe if you no longer want to receive marketing emails from us. See the Opt Out section below for more details.

If you were on the Hollister Co. marketing email list prior to September 2014 and supply your email address on HollisterCo.jp you may receive emails catered to your location.

#### Sending Electronic Postcards or Emailing an Item to a Friend

When you send an electronic postcard, or email an item to a friend from our Websites, the designated recipient will receive your name and email address, as well as any information you entered in the message. The email address information of your recipient is not used for any marketing purposes by us or our affiliate companies unless they have already submitted it for this reason, nor is such information rented, sold or exchanged with third parties for their marketing purposes. We do not review any information provided in the message content. You should not send postcards or items to friends unless you believe your friend would be interested and want to receive the information.

#### My Account

If you are 18 years of age or older you are given the opportunity to create an account on our Websites and Apps. Creating an account requires you to enter your email address, first and last name, and to create a password, and allows you to provide postal addresses, a phone number, payment details, date of birth, gender, and favorite categories. By providing this information we are able to offer you a more personalized experience on our Websites, Apps, and in communications. In addition, we may identify you when you sign into your account and we may personalize messaging, promotions or product recommendations. Some of the features in the account section allow you to create an address book, save a wish list, subscribe to and update your marketing email frequency, access your order history, and enjoy "quick checkouts" by having us automatically enter your name, phone number, email, postal address, and payment details in the checkout process. When you create an account you will receive a welcome email that will be delivered to the email address you inserted into the email field on the create an account page. .

To request to have your account cancelled send an email to [Privacy_Policy@HollisterCo.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20170624045338id_/http%3A//www.hollisterco.jp/en_JP/Privacy_Policy@HollisterCo.com) from the email address associated with the account you wish to cancel.

#### My Account – Payment Info

If you choose to add a payment type in the account section, you will be able to access this information during checkout when you are signed in. Your preferred payment type will pre-populate during checkout, or you can pick another type by selecting from the drop down list if you choose to save several payment types. If a payment card has expired we will indicate this by highlighting it in red on the Payment Info page, and you can remove this expired payment type and insert a new one if desired. You will have the option to add a new payment type during checkout by ticking a box indicating that you want to store the newly entered payment details in your account. If you reset your account password your payment types will be deleted from your account for security purposes.

#### My Account – Address Book

If you have created an account on our Websites or Apps you may use the personal address book which allows you to save all of the different names and addresses to whom you frequently send purchases or gifts. When you want to send a purchase to someone in your address book, sign into your account and once in checkout you can choose from the saved address list.

#### My Account - Forgot Password

If you forget your password and select to reset it you will be asked to insert the email address for your account so we can send you an email. Once you receive the email click on the link provided and when you are directed to the Website, enter and submit a password that meets the requirements to reset it.

In order to proceed to your account you will be required to insert your first and last name, enter a password that meets the requirements, and agree to the legal terms as stated on this page. In addition, if you fill out the needed information on this page and submit it, and you are previously signed up to receive marketing emails, you will now receive marketing emails catered to your location.

#### Sold Out or Product Email Alert

If you provide us with your email address to contact you when a product on the site is available for purchase or to show interest in a product, the email address you submit will only be used for such purpose. The email address will not be used for any additional promotional purposes by us or our affiliate companies, and will be purged after the email(s) are sent or if there is no longer a need to maintain the data.

If you purchase merchandise through our Websites, we will gather your personal data (including your name, billing and shipping address information, email address, telephone number, banking and payment information), as well as information about your purchases on our Websites, which we may combine with your store purchase information. In addition, if you have created an account you will be able to view your order details in the account section. Some information provided in checkout may be used to personalize a future visit or communications, to cater products or offers to you or shared with affiliates or third parties for our marketing or advertising purposes.

Depending on the terms of the social media site, this information could include: your name, email address, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, date of birth, likes, education history, work history, current city, hometown, interests, relationship status, and location. Once you grant this permission, Hollister Co. will be able to continue to be linked to the permitted Personal Social Media Account and collect information without a further request for permission, which could include later revisions to existing information or new types of information that you add. If you no longer want your Personal Social Media Account(s) linked to our Websites/Apps, click on the ‘disconnect’ link located on our Websites/Apps near the corresponding social media button and we will stop collecting this information.

In the event that we, or our parent company, are acquired by a new owner, or if following a reorganization of our corporate group we become part of one of our affiliate companies, your information may be transferred to a new owner, or another of our affiliate companies, as part of our assets.

#### 1\. What Are Cookies, Pixel Tags and URL Links, and How Are These Used on Our Websites or in Our Emails?

Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may use, a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer or device. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device. The information collected when visiting our Websites may include the following: an IP address, the URL of the page from which you arrived; your browser type; other technical information about your device used to visit our Websites; the pages you view; the features you use; whether you create an account, or sign in and where you go on our Websites once signed in; whether you complete a transaction; whether you have previously completed a survey; and the time of your visit. This information allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Websites are most visited or used, what products are browsed and/or purchased, the effectiveness of the Websites, your specific interaction with our Websites, and difficulties you may experience in accessing our Websites. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on our Websites by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, personalize your experience, and resolve access difficulties. In addition, our Websites use cookies to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, whether you purchase any or all of those items, and to tell us whether you have visited one of our Websites in the past. This allows you to maintain shopping carts between visits and allows us to inquire about your continued interest in items in your shopping cart or that you viewed on one of our Websites. Our Websites also use cookies to help keep track of checkout information, other than payment method information, while you remain on our Websites. In addition, the information collected by us or our service provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.

Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may also use, Pixel Tags (also known as Web beacons, Web bugs, and Clear GIFs) on the Websites and in emails. A Pixel Tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Webpage or email message. Pixel Tags may be used to collect the same information about your visit that is collected through cookies, as noted above. We may also collect information about a search engine used, and a search engine advertisement clicked to navigate to the Websites. Pixel Tags in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails (including your interaction with our Websites as a result of receiving the email) and the time our email is viewed. This information helps us to make similar evaluations about our Websites and emails as with cookies and to determine the most desired features and information so that we can provide those features and information to you and personalize our interactions with you. This information may also be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.

In addition, our email communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on one of our Websites. By clicking on one of the URLs, you will automatically enter one of our Websites and we may collect information related to the "click-through". You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on the URL links in our email communications.

#### 2.How Third Parties Serve You Our Advertisements On Other Websites and Your Choices

We contract with third party advertising companies to serve you online display and banner advertisements on other websites. To serve this advertising, these third parties may place, use or rely on technology, such as cookies and/or Pixel Tags, to collect information about your interactions with our Websites and Apps and interactions with other websites. These advertising companies may use and share the information gathered to deliver our ads more tailored to your interests on other websites that are a part of their online advertising networks and/or search engines. We receive aggregate information from these third parties to gauge our advertising effectiveness. To opt out you can click on the icon that may appear on some of our advertising served through these technologies. We may use more than one third party company for placing this advertising, which would require you to opt out of each company.
