**Use of Cookies**

Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Holistic Healing Guide pages, or register with Holistic Healing Guide site or services, a cookie helps Holistic Healing Guide to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Holistic Healing Guide Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Holistic Healing Guide features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Holistic Healing Guide services or Web sites you visit.

**Security of your Personal Information**  
Holistic Healing Guide secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Holistic Healing Guide secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Holistic Healing Guide will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Holistic Healing Guide encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Holistic Healing Guide is protecting your information.
