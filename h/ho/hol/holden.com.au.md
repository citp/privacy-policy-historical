# Privacy Policy - Holden. Go better.

Holden complies with the National Privacy Principles. 

Holden respects the rights of individuals to determine to whom they give their personal information and how this information is used. Holden collects and uses your information in order to provide better customer service by striving to meet your needs and expectations about our cars and other products. We will not sell your information to any other organisation. 

We will be fair and open about the way we collect information about you and what we intend to do with the information. We share information about you with our affiliated companies and related companies, like General Motors, Daewoo, SAAB and contracted service providers, as well as dealers to assist them to improve the quality and standard of service they provide to you. We also provide information to industry bodies and others for the purposes of audits of our records. Our Dealers, affiliated companies and related companies share information with us about you so that we can learn more about your expectations of us and how we can meet them. Where practicable, we will collect personal information directly from you. If we receive information about you from someone else or provide information to someone else about you, like our Dealers or contractors providing services to us, wherever possible we will make sure they comply with the Privacy Act. 

We will be open with you about the kinds of personal information we hold and what we do with it. We will strive to ensure that information about you is accurate when we collect or use it. Wherever possible and appropriate we will let you see the information we hold about you and correct it if it is wrong. If we do not grant you access to your personal information we will tell you why. 

We will keep your information secure. Only properly authorised people are permitted to see or use it. We will take steps to protect your privacy if we send personal information about you outside Australia. 

When we no longer use your information we will take care to properly de-identify it or destroy it. 

If you are unhappy with the way we have collected, used or shared your information we will investigate and respond to your complaint. Please contact Holden's Customer Assistance on 1800 033 349 or email us at [customerassistance.holden@gm.com](mailto:customerassistance.holden@gm.com). 

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT HOLDEN'S USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION GENERALLY 

_(a)Holden's use and disclosure of personal information_

**Warranty**

As part of the purchase of your new Holden vehicle, you usually obtain Holden's new vehicle warranty. Holden collects personal information from your Holden dealer when you purchase your new vehicle so that Holden can ensure that any warranty claim is properly administered. 

If you withdraw your consent to Holden collecting your personal information from your dealer for this purpose, this will affect Holden's ability to process your warranty claims. 

**Product Recalls**

Holden collects personal information from your Holden Dealer when you purchase your new vehicle so that Holden can ensure that you are contacted as soon as possible in the event of a safety related product recall. 

**Holden Assist/Roadside Assistance/Extended Warranty**

Holden engages contractors to provide Holden Assist, Holden Roadside Assistance and Holden's Extended Vehicle Warranty. Holden's agreements with these contractors require them to deal with your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act. Holden Assist, Holden Roadside Assistance and Holden Extended Vehicle Warranty brochures provide you with more information about these services. 

If you withdraw your consent to Holden disclosing your personal information to these contractors, this will affect Holden's ability to deliver these services to you. 

**GM Holden MasterCard**

The GM Holden MasterCard is offered and administered by Westpac Banking Corporation. Westpac collects personal information from applicants and card holders and participating organisations, and discloses some of this information to Holden for the purposes of ensuring that card holders are able to claim their GM Holden MasterCard rebate when purchasing an eligible Holden vehicle. Please also see _"(c) How is my personal information used?"_ below for further details. 

If you withdraw your consent to Holden obtaining this information from Westpac, you will not be able to claim your GM Holden MasterCard rebate because Holden will be unable to collect or verify your entitlement to a rebate. 

**Customer and Product Surveys**

From time to time Holden surveys its customers regarding their satisfaction with Holden's products and services and the products and services provided by its Dealers and contracted services providers, such as Roadside Assistance. 

If you do not wish to participate in any survey received from Holden, please contact Holden's Customer Assistance on 1800 033 349 or email us at [customerassistance.holden@gm.com](mailto:customerassistance.holden@gm.com). Holden will note your request and respect your wish not to receive any future surveys. 

If you choose not to participate in surveys conducted by Holden, Holden is less able to improve its products and services and the products and services provided by its Dealers and contracted service providers. 

**Direct Marketing**

From time to time Holden sends marketing materials to its customers and other people who have provided Holden with personal information about products and services offered by Holden, its Dealers and its affiliates. 

If you do not wish to receive marketing materials from Holden or its affiliates, please complete the opt-out provision on the marketing information sent to you and return it to Holden (or contact Holden's Customer Assistance on 1800 033 349 or email us at [customerassistance.holden@gm.com](mailto:customerassistance.holden@gm.com)). Holden will note your request and respect your wish not to receive any marketing materials. 

If you choose not to receive any marketing materials from Holden, you may miss out on special product and service offerings and opportunities. 

**Event Data Recorders**

Holden vehicles, like other modern motor vehicles, have a number of sophisticated computer systems that monitor and control several aspects of the vehicle's performance. Holden vehicles use on-board vehicle computers to monitor emission control components to optimize fuel economy, to monitor conditions for air bag deployment and, if so equipped, to provide anti-lock braking and to help the driver control the vehicle in difficult driving situations. Some information may be stored during regular operations to facilitate repair of detected malfunctions; other information is stored only in certain collision events by computer systems, such as those commonly called event data recorders (EDR). The information from EDR's, if available, is used to improve customer and driver safety, better understand what happens to our vehicles in the event of a collision and shall be provided to the police on request. 

**Recruitment**

If you send Holden an application for a job or resume, Holden will use this information to assess your application and may disclose this information to its related companies (both in Australia and overseas) and contracted service providers for purposes such as aptitude, psychological and medical testing and human resources management activities. As part of the application process you will be asked for your specific consent for Holden to obtain information about your pre-employment medical examination (including drug and alcohol testing) and psychological and aptitude testing and the use and disclosure of the results of those tests.   
A refusal to provide any of this information, or to consent to its disclosure to Holden or to allow Holden to provide this information to the parties described above, may affect the success of your application. 

Holden may also ask you whether you agree to your personal information being provided to Holden's related companies and affiliates overseas for other positions relevant to your qualifications and experience that may arise. For example, HOLDEN's operations in: 

**\- Australia and New Zealand  
\- Asia Pacific   
\- Latin America and Middle East   
\- North America   
\- Europe
