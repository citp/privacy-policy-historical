This Privacy Notice applies to the Personal Information we collect and use when you:

Holt Renfrew may also have access to the information you share with these retailers as they utilize Holt Renfrew’s point of sale system. This Privacy Notice will apply to our use of that information.

  


##### **COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Personal Information is information about an identifiable individual. It does not include your business contact information, or anonymous or aggregate information which does not identify you.

For the most part, Holt Renfrew collects information about you when you give it directly to us. For example, when you set up a Holt Renfrew profile, make a purchase, participate in an event, promotion or contest or reach out to us. Like many companies, we automatically collect technical data when you interact with our websites and other technologies. You can learn more how we collect and use Personal Information in the following sections.

##### **DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES; CHILDREN**

##### **SECURITY AND STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us.
