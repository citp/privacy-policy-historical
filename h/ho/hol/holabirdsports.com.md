### Personally Identifiable Information

When you submit personally identifiable information through Holabird Sports, we make sure your information is protected both online and off.

Our checkout page is always secure. You can only enter personally identifiable information (credit card number, billing address, etc) on this secure page. Your information is immediately encrypted and protected using Verisign SSL — the best encryption software in the industry. You will know your page is secure by the lock icon on your web browser.

Our website also utilizes McAfee Secure which monitors our site daily to protect you from identity theft, spyware, and other online threats.

You can verify the security level of any page on our site: click the Verisign Secured Seal or McAfee Secure Seal located at the top of every page. By simply clicking on this seal an automatically updated page opens. These pages detail exactly how Holabird Sports uses VeriSign and McAfee services to help protect you.

While we use the best SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of your personally identifiable information is restricted in our offices and only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access. Our employees must use password-protected screens when they leave their desk and when they return, they must re-enter their password to gain access to your information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
