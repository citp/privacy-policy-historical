# Privacy Statement for Hobo Series- Hobotraveler.com / HoboHideOut.com etc.

Hello,  
Privacy or respect for our visitors is a major priority for the Hobo series of websites. Whether just a visitor to a webpage, or submit to a message board, or read one of newsletters we take this responsibility serious. 

E-MAIL PRIVACY  
Your e-mail has never been, and never will be available to any third party.   
( That means nobody )

E-MAIL PRIVACY ( Ugly and mis-leading tactics... Examples of we DO NOT DO)  
I, Andy the Hobo subscribe to lots of newsletters. I am always trying to limit the number of extra emails in my box. This is especially important, because I am a traveler, and work out of Internet Cafes. Extra emails take up time and can be annoying. I am not a big proponent of the crazy anti-spam attackers. I think hitting the delete button is pretty easy, and some folks out there are going overboard in their McCarthyism or Gestapo Techniques. I think this needs to end. But.... the problem has become more complicated, and LARGE WEBSITES LIKE MINE are not becoming a BIG PROBLEM. The large websites learn ways around the rules and are becoming the biggest spammers of them all. Knowledge is power in a sense, and the misuse of this knowledge and power is misguide and sometimes dangerous. So I am going to explain some ways that unethical sites collect your email, and then send advertisements to you 

BUSINESS PRACTICES.

You receive a letter with just an advertisement or the announcing a new something, that has nothing to do with the topic or the webpage of that is related to the newsletter, or associated. This is an ADVERTISEMENT.
