# Home | HobbyTown USA

## 

This policy describes how we collect information at this website (www.hobbytown.com) and what we use it for. On this page, Hobby Town Unlimited, Inc., which does business as HobbyTown® and HobbyTown USA®, will be referred to as “we” or “us” and the user of this site will be referred to as “you.”

## 

#### What information do we collect?

## 

**Information you give us.** If you tell us your name, where you live, your email address or phone number by filling out a form or sending us an e-mail, we collect that information.

## 

**Information we collect about all visitors.** Everybody who visits our site is actually telling their browser to ask us to send them our information. That’s how the World Wide Web works. Typing in our address or clicking a link to our site starts your request. That request tells us the numerical IP address of the computer or network that asked for the information and what information is being requested. Your request may also tell us information about your computer, operating system, and web browser. We may also learn what web page brought you to us, what pages you visit, and what link you clicked to leave our site.

## 

#### What do we do with the information we collect?

## 

**We do the things you ask.** Obviously, if you want us to do something with your information, we will.  If you ask for e-mail, we send it. If you tell us where to ship something, we will print out a label with your address and ship your purchase to you. If you ask us to call you, we will dial your phone number. If you put something on your “WANT” list, our site will post it to your Facebook page. 

## 

**We try to make your experience better.** We offer a “shopping cart” for your convenience, we try to identify the things you might be interested in and show them to you, and we remember your preferences for using the web site.

## 

**We try to improve our business.** We look at “analytics,” which are reports about how the web site is being used. An outside company that helps us with our web site may assist us.  We do not identify individual customers in this process.  Instead, we look at statistics about where customers are located, how they are using the site, what pages and products they are viewing, and how long they stay. We use this information to make our products, and our web site, more attractive to customers.

## 

**We may offer you additional products or services.** We may contact you with information about our products or our company that we think may interest you, using the contact information you have provided. We don’t want to waste your time or bother you, so if you tell us you don’t want to receive such information, we will do everything we reasonably can to stop further efforts to reach you. You may contact us at marketing@hobbytown.com and we will process your request. Please give us a few days to make sure we take care of all the details.

## 

**We turn over information when we are legally required to do so.** If a law, a judge or a government body requires that we provide information we have collected, and we determine we are obligated to provide it, we will turn the information over. In unusual cases, we may provide information to others if we reasonably expect to help prevent fraud or harm by doing so.

## 

#### A note about “cookies” and related files.

## 

Our site uses “cookies.” A cookie is a small computer file our website sends to your computer. That file connects your computer with information we have stored about your interaction with us. For example, your preferences about viewing our website, the contents of your shopping cart, or your login information may be identified by the cookie stored on your computer. A “flash cookie” is a similar file stored by the Flash program on your computer. It may store information related to multimedia playback, such as the volume you prefer when watching videos. You can tell your browser not to accept cookies, or to notify you when you get cookies. Please understand that doing so may prevent certain features of our website from operating as we intended.

## 

#### Do we give or sell your information to others?

## 

We do not sell or rent your information to other people. We do not share it with other companies who are going to try to sell you stuff. The people and companies who help us with our website may have access to information we collect, but we ask them not to provide that information or access it for any purpose other than making our website work.

## 

#### Do we protect your information?

## 

We use industry-standard technology to protect your information from unauthorized disclosure.  We ask our employees and the people and companies who help us to do the same.

## 

#### What about your bank or credit card information?

## 

We do not collect your financial information. You pay for purchases from our website through PayPal, which is a separate company, not related to us in any way. PayPal tells us only who paid us, how much, and when. Please refer to PayPal’s privacy policy about how they store and use information.

## 

#### What does the “do not track” setting in my browser do on your site?

## 

“Do not track” is a new feature of some browsers. The authorities that run the World Wide Web have not yet agreed on what that feature should do. Currently our site does not respond to the “do not track” setting in your browser. We do not, however, track your activities on websites other than hobbytown.com.

## 

#### Policy respecting children under 13 years old.

## 

We do not intend to collect, nor do we knowingly keep, personally identifying information for children under 13 years of age. If we learn a child under 13 years of age has given us personally identifying information, we will do everything we reasonably can to delete such information, and we will not use that information for any purpose. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us personally identifiable information, contact us at __[privacy@hobbytown.com](mailto:privacy@hobbytown.com) so we may delete the information.
