### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Intelligent Demand collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

Intelligent Demand also collects potentially personally-identifying information such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

The privacy practices set forth in this privacy policy are for this website only. If you link to other web sites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Intelligent Demand does not own or control, or to people that Intelligent Demand does not employ or manage.
