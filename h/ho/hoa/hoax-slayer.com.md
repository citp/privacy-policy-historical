# Privacy Policy

Rest assured that any personal information that you submit on this site is safe with me.

I will never sell or give away your email address, or any other personal information, for any reason what so ever. 

The Hoax-Slayer Newsletter uses a double opt-in subscription system that ensures that you really did want to subscribe. The email address that you provide when subscribing is used solely for delivering the monthly newsletter and administrative emails such as subscription and unsubscription notices. The subscription process is outlined below: 

  1. Access the simple online subscription form available on the [home page](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/) and in the left column of most other pages on the site (including this one).
  2. Enter your email address, and click the button. All being well, you will receive a confirmation email.
  3. Finalize the subscription by using the link provided in the confirmation email. When you follow this link, by clicking it or copying and pasting it into your browser address bar, your email address will be immediately added to the list of subscribers.



If you decide that you no longer wish to receive the Hoax-Slayer Newsletter, unsubscribing is a simple process. There are two ways to unsubscribe:

  1. Follow the link provided in the footer of every issue of the newsletter. When you follow this link, by clicking it or copying and pasting it into your browser address bar, your email address will be immediately removed from the list of subscribers.
  2. Visit the special [Unsubscribe Web Page](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/unsub.html) and follow the instructions. A direct link to the Unsubscribe Web Page is also included in the footer of every issue of the newsletter.



Once the unsubscription process is completed, your email address will no longer be listed in the subscriber database. You will no longer receive the newsletter or any other emails from me unless I am replying to a personal email you have sent.

Hoax-Slayer is totally anti-spam. I will never, ever send unsolicited advertising email! In fact, I have a personal policy of NEVER buying a product or service as a result of spam email, regardless of its intrinsic worth.

In order to use some services provided on the Hoax-Slayer site it might be necessary to provide information such as your name and email address. These services include the newsletter subscription form, contact forms, the Hoax-Slayer Forums and the Tell a Friend form. None of the information you provide will be used for any purpose other than that for which it was originally intended. Furthermore, all services found on the site that request you to provide information are exclusively hosted on this website. Thus, none of the information you submit is passed through any third party websites or organizations and this enhances your privacy. 

Like many other webmasters, I use a service that records raw statistical information such as the number of visitors to the Hoax-Slayer site, what pages are the most popular and system information such as the operating system and browser used by visitors. The stats service I use on this site is provided by [StatCounter.com](http://www.statcounter.com/). In order to gather this information, StatCounter may send a cookie to your computer. Any information collected is solely for statistical purposes and is not used to identify individuals in any way.

The Hoax-Slayer Newsletter and website uses advertising to generate revenue. I would never knowingly include advertisements that promote fraudulent products or companies. However, it should be understood that I am in no way responsible for the conduct or reliability of advertisers.

I also participate in a limited number of affiliate marketing programs. The site and newsletter may include reviews or recommendations for carefully chosen affiliate products. For more details, you can view the [Hoax-Slayer Affiliate Marketing Policy](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/affiliate-marketing-policy.html).

As an Internet user, online privacy is an important issue for me, in respect to both my privacy and yours. If you have any concerns, comments, or questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please email me via the [Hoax-Slayer Contact Form](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/submit-material.html).
