# HOVRS - Privacy Policy

   


Hands On Video Relay Services, Inc. ("HOVRS" or "we" or "our") strives to protect the privacy of visitors who provide information to HOVRS through its web site. The purpose of this statement is to explain to our visitors the type of information HOVRS obtains about visitors to our websites, how we gather it, and how we use and retain it.

**Information We Collect:** To gauge the effectiveness of our websites, we do collect some generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's domain name (such as .com, .edu, etc.), the web page from which a visitor enters our site, which pages a visitor visits on our site, and how much time a visitor spends on each page. We use web beacons (a.k.a. clear gifs) to track use of our site and to track what sites users came from and go to after leaving our site. We aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve our websites. We also use "cookies" to track use of the website as described further below.

HOVRS also collects personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, postal address) and/or third party personally identifiable information through its website. You may choose to provide such information to HOVRS in a number of ways through our website such as by: 

  * Ordering a product or service from us; 
  * Sending us e-mail; 
  * Registering to receive news, public policy updates; or information about our products; 
  * Applying for a job or a grant; 
  * Entering a contest. 



When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, HOVRS uses reasonable efforts to use the information for that purpose only (such as to provide the information the visitor has requested or to consider a visitor for a particular job). When visitors use our websites to order services, or to request information about them, we may use the individual information as we would use the same information obtained off-line - for example, to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. You have the right to choose not to receive this information by notifying us of your preference.

We do not sell individual information obtained on-line about our visitors, but if our company does get sold the information we have collected is an asset that would be sold along with the company . And, we will not disclose the individual information provided to us on-line to anyone outside of HOVRS unless you specifically authorize it, disclosure is necessary to provide services you have requested, the information is acquired as part of a merger or sale of the company, disclosure is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property.

If you provide individual information to us in the context of an event that HOVRS sponsors with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the information to the co-sponsor. In those circumstances, the co-sponsor's privacy policy will control, so review their information carefully. HOVRS also uses third party contractors to perform services such as website management, site design, site hosting and special promotions, and such third parties may be given access to user information in order to provide these services. 

**Email:**  
HOVRS does not send unsolicited "junk" email (spam). We may use email to communicate with our customers, to respond to visitors' emails, to confirm orders placed online, and to send information that a visitor has requested. If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can simply reply to ask not to receive future emails. HOVRS provides an unsubscribe function in its email campaigns in order for subscribers to opt out of further email communications from us.

**Use of Cookies:**  
HOVRS websites also use "cookies". They allow us to serve you better. When you use our site we send information, a cookie, to your computer and it is stored there. When you return to our site, your computer sends the cookie back to us. This allows our server to recognize your computer and any settings you created on our site. It restores those settings so you don't have to enter the same information every time you visit. For example, if you entered your zip code on a visit to our site, when you return you will see information for that zip code without typing it in again. The fact that our server recognizes your computer when it retrieves the cookies does not mean that HOVRS is actually acquiring information about you. You can set your browser to delete cookies or to tell you before you accept one. Look in your browser's Options or Preferences menu.

**Security:**  
HOVRS uses Secure Socket Layer technology with encryption for the transmission of sensitive data such as credit card information and Social Security Number.

HOVRS endeavors to safeguard the security of user information that we collect. through our websites. We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our customers and expect our partners and suppliers to do so as well.

**Compliance with Laws:**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
