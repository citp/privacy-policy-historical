# Our Privacy Policy | Bernard Hodes Group

**Mum's the word around here**  
At Bernard Hodes Group, we respect your right to keep your personally identifiable information private. That's why we will never rent or share your information with third parties. We will only collect and hold your e-mail address for the purpose of providing you with the articles, reports or newsletters you have voluntarily and specifically requested. We hate spam as much as you do, and are dedicated to ensuring you never receive any from us.

**Your e-mail is safe**  
When you give us your e-mail address in order to receive monthly newsletters, articles or reports, or enter contests, you can rest assured we will use your address only for that purpose. We will never send you any information you have not asked for. We will also never, ever, share your e-mail address with marketing people or any other third party.

**So is your friend's**  
Throughout our site, we offer you the chance to share our information with a friend. Don't be shy about using this feature--your friend's e-mail address will be completely safe. We will use your friend's e-mail address only to send him or her the information you've requested. After that, your friend will never hear from us again, unless they voluntarily request it. It is, however, up to you to ensure that when you give us your friend's e-mail address, you're absolutely sure he or she will be receptive to receiving information from us.

**You're never committed**  
As great as we think our reports and newsletters are, we realize you may not want to receive them forever. That's why we've made it easy to take your name off our list. If you decide you no longer want to receive information from us, just click on the unsubscribe link in your email. Type in the e-mail address you used to subscribe, and click the Unsubscribe button. You'll be unsubscribed automatically and you will not receive any further information from us.
