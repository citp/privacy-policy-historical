# HODINKEE Privacy Policy

**Last modified: 10/18/2018**

Welcome to Hodinkee’s Privacy Policy.  Hodinkee (“Hodinkee,” “we”, “our” or “us”) takes the privacy of your information very seriously.  We believe that you have a right to know what information we collect from you, and we want you to understand our commitment to protecting your privacy. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the “Privacy Policy”) describes the collection, use and disclosure of your information on hodinkee.com and shop.hodinkee.com (collectively, the “Site”) and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively with the Site, the “Services”).  We’ve tried to be straightforward, but we want you to understand the policy, so please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

When you use the Services, we receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your “Account”); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, so please read this carefully. 

**By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.**

Remember that your use of Hodinkee’s Services is at all times subject to the [Terms of Use](https://www.hodinkee.com/terms-of-service), which incorporates this Privacy Policy.  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the [Terms of Use](https://www.hodinkee.com/terms-of-service). 

**What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.   

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”). While we try to make sure that we work with Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.

As noted in the [Terms of Use](https://www.hodinkee.com/terms-of-service), we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 (or if you are in the EU, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 16). If you are under 13 (or under 16 in the EU), please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 (or under age 16 in the EU), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 (or under 16 in the EU) may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at contact@hodinkee.com. 

**What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?**

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services, updating the “Last Modified” date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy, or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  We collect the following types of information from our users.

_Account Information_ : 

When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your username, password and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, but only rarely when we feel such information is important. You may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings, although we, regardless, reserve the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.

_User Content_ :

Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.

_Location Information_ : 

Some of our Services may include features based on users’ actual locations and may report on users’ current locations (“Location-Based Services”).  To the extent you use any Location-Based Services, we may collect and store information about your location at the time you use those Location-Based Services (in addition to some automatically collected geolocation data as noted below). This information can come from a variety of sources depending on the device you use to access the Services; for example, a mobile phone may report its GPS location at the time Location-Based Services are used.

_Financial Information:_

We do not currently collect financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information); that information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company (the “Payment Processor”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy. Our online store is currently hosted by Shopify Inc. (“Shopify”). Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell certain merchandise to you. When you provide Personal Information in connection with a purchase on or through the Service, such Personal Information is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases, and the general Shopify application. Shopify may transfer, process or store your data outside of the United States and such data may be subject to disclosure as required by applicable law. For more information, you can read Shopify’s Terms of Service ([https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms)) or Privacy Statement ([https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy](https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy)).

_IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically_ :

  * We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your web browser or device when you interact with the Services, including your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, cookie information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on). 



Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them. _Email Communications_ :

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.

_Information Collected Using Cookies_ :

  * Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet. 
  * Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one.
  * Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.  We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services. 
  * Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you visit the Site or click on ads that appear on the Services. If you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you.   
  * This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.
  * For more information on cookies, including how to control your cookie settings and preferences, visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
  * We use the following cookies:



**Essential Cookies**

Essential cookies are required for providing you features or services that you have requested. For example, certain cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or use a shopping cart feature within our Services. Disabling these cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.

**Functionality Cookies**

Functional cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time, and recognize you when you return to our Services. These cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).

**Performance/Analytical Cookies**

Performance/analytical cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Site and Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Site, what pages visitors view on our Site, and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Site. Performance/analytical cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising.

**Retargeting/Advertising Cookies**

Retargeting/advertising cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.

_Do Not Track Policy:_

Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. When you turn on the Do Not Track function (sometimes also identified as Incognito Mode or Private Browsing) in your browser, we stop collecting the information from your browser that allows us to tailor advertisements and other content specifically to you that is based on your visits to our advertising partners’ websites.  Specifically, we stop collecting information from the unique browser cookie that links your browser to visits to third party sites.  Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked.  Remember that this is just _our_ Do Not Track policy, and we can’t and don’t make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your browser.

_Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons_ : 

To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.”  Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. 

Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services. 

To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we don’t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.

_Aggregate Information_ :

We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser.

_Information Regarding Your Social Networks_ : 

Occasionally, you can use your Account on our Services to interact with your accounts on other services, such as Facebook or Twitter.  In addition to using your third party account credentials to sign in to the Services, you can access posting and sharing tools on the Services, including a “share” button that allows you to post information to your social networks outside of the Services (“Share”). 

Please note that these tools may be operated by Third Party Services. By using these tools, you acknowledge that some third party account information may be transmitted into your Account with us, and that third party account information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.  Additionally, when you use one of these sharing tools, the Third Party Service that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser or online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own privacy policy.  Lastly, when you use these tools, some of your information from the Services (such as the reservation information you selected to Share) may be shared with the Third Party Service and others.  Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policies and other policies of the social networks you use in connection with the Services. 

**How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?**

It’s important for you to know that we never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy Policy); or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you. 

_Public Information About Your Activity on the Services_ :

Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services.

Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. Unregistered users will not have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us. 

Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it’s information you want to share with everyone. 

_IP Address Information_ :

While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy. We do this for the purposes of operating, enhancing, and improving the Services.

_Information You Elect to Share_ :

You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.

_Aggregate Information_ :

We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

_Email Communications with Us_ :

As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications relating to your Account. Communications relating to your Account will only be sent for purposes important to the Services, such as password recovery.

_User Profile Information_ : 

User profile information including your username and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other users.

Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,” if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile.  Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service. 

_Financial Information:_

As stated above, we do not currently collect financial information, as that information is collected and stored by our Payment Processor. However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial information from our Payment Processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Services, enrolling you in discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, protecting against or identifying possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.

_Information Shared with Affiliated Businesses:_

In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.

_Information Shared with Advertisers:_

We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.  Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach. 

_Information Shared with Our Agents_ : 

In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as service providers, consultants, and other agents ("Agents"), for the purposes of operating, enhancing, and improving the Services, and developing new products and services. For example, we use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.

_Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers_ : 

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

_Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others_ : 

We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.

_Information We Share With Your Consent_ : 

Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

**Is Information About Me Secure?**

Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your Account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account.

We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. 

We otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.

**What Information of Mine Can I Access?**

If you are a registered user, you can access information associated with your Account by logging into the Services. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.

The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at contact@hodinkee.com.

_California Privacy Rights_ : Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: PO Box 1210, New York, NY 10013.

**How Can I Delete My Account?**

Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing contact@hodinkee.com. If you terminate your Account, any association between your Account and information we store will no longer be accessible through your Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the public.

**What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?**

  * You can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.
  * You can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take advantage of some of our features.
  * You can delete your Account. Please note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account, and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible. 
  * Finally, keep in mind that if you choose to turn on the Do Not Track function on your browser, we may continue to use all information we collected prior to your turning that function on, in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.



**What If I Have Questions or Concerns?**

If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message to contact@hodinkee.com. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.

**EU Residents**

If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below. 

For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.  Hodinkee will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.

If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.  If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at GDPR@hodinkee.com.

We retain Personal Data with respect to Prospects of our Services for up to 4 years and Personal Data with respect to Ex-Prospects for up to 2 years.   A “Prospect” is someone who has signed up to receive marketing communications.  An “Ex-Prospect” is defined as someone who has not engaged with us for more than 4 years since the time they have signed up to receive marketing communications. Therefore, we retain Personal Data with respect to Prospects for at least 6 years. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.

**What Security Measures Do We Use?**   We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity. For example, we only work with third party technological or software platforms that have industry standard security measures to handle our data and transactions. For additional security measure, all passwords are being stored as a salted hash using industry standard methods.  While we seek to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Data. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. We do not guarantee or warrant that our industry-standard techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Data or otherwise.

**Personal Data of Children** **:   **As noted in the Terms of Use we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us.  If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at GDPR@hodinkee.com. 

**What Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Data?**   You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below.  For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email GDPR@hodinkee.com.

**Transfers of Personal Data** **:** The Services are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Hodinkee and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Hodinkee in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Hodinkee to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S. pursuant to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, the details of which are further set forth below.

Hodinkee has certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection and use of Personal Data transferred from the EU. For more information about the Privacy Shield Program, and to view Hodinkee’s certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov. Hodinkee is committed to the Privacy Shield Principles of (1) notice, (2) consent, (3) accountability for onward transfer, (4) security, (5) data integrity and purpose limitation, (6) access and (7) recourse, enforcement and liability with respect to all Personal Data received from within the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing Personal Data on our behalf fails to comply with these Privacy Shield Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage).  Hodinkee’s compliance with the Privacy Shield is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. 

Please contact us at GDPR@hodinkee.com with any questions or concerns relating to our Privacy Shield Certification.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield-related complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, you may also resolve a Privacy Shield-related complaint through JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.  You can visit https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim for more information or to file a complaint, at no cost to you.  Under certain conditions, you may also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for complaints not resolved by other means.
