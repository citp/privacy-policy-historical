### What information we collect about you

Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.

##### **Site visitors:**

When someone visits www.hopperhq.com we use third party services, Google Analytics & Mixpanel, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site and how those visitors arrived at the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will be up front about this. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with it.

##### **Information Collected Upon Registration:**

If you desire to use the Hopper HQ web and mobile tools ( e.g. app.hopperhq.com) and want access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Hopper HQ. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with.

##### **Use of Contact Information:**

In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service.

For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service.
