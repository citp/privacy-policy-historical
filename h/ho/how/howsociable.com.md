Our site grants users the ability to post information on their blog, and such users should remember that the blog is public. Content will remain anonymous under the circumstances, but also may not be protected for reasons outside of our control, including subpoenas, government action, and other actions.

Clients who pay for professional services may be prompted to enter credit card information for their transaction. In cases where a credit card is accepted as payment, this information will not be shared by any third party. Personal information also will not be shared, aside from typical business usage and transaction processing purposes. Your information will not be shared with a third party for marketing.

### Exceptions to the HowSociable Privacy Policy

Should an attorney or government agency subpoena identifying or personal information, or should a formal request be made pertaining to any pending legal action, we would share all information we possess with the party seeking the information. However, it is unlikely that HowSociable maintains any info outside of what you have willingly provided on the site.

Additionally, should our attorney request personal identifying information for a legal reason that is either current or pending, provided you are a contributor or party in the suit, we will share information provided with our attorney.
