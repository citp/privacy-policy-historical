<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HISHE’s Terms of Use Policy and Agreement is incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy. Please carefully read this Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms of Use Policy, before supplying any personal or identifying information to our Website. &nbsp;We reserve the right to update, amend, or otherwise change this Privacy Policy at any time. &nbsp;Our current Privacy Policy will always be accessible through our Website. &nbsp;Any changes are effective immediately after posting the new policy to our Website. &nbsp;If any changes are made to this policy that would affect how we use your personal information, you will have the chance to opt out of that new use or the choice to discontinue using this Website. &nbsp;For any questions regarding this policy, please contact us at the information contained below.</p>
