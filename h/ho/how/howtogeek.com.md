**Delicious Cookies**  
In accordance with the Adsense Terms of Service, we are required to let you know that all advertising programs use cookies to track visitors. This is true for pretty much every single site on the internet. In fact, most sites that allow you to login use a cookie to track the fact that you are logged in. If you are unhappy with this, feel free to disable cookies in your browser, although you won’t be able to login anywhere if you do that.

**Email Privacy**  
We will never sell your email address to any third parties, ever. If we ever sell your email address to anybody, we agree that you can beat us with a large metal object. The object must be at least 4 feet long and weigh more than 20lbs.

**More Privacy Stuff**
