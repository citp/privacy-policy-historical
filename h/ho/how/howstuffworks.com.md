# Howstuffworks "Privacy Statement for HowStuffWorks.com"

HowStuffWorks.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our online information gathering and dissemination practices. 

Our overall policy is extremely simple: If we collect information from you, we use it only for the purposes for which it was collected, and the other limited purposes outlined below. We will not sell or share your personally identifiable information with any third party (except our parent company and its other wholly owned subsidiaries; and except in a transfer of our business assets). 

With respect to the Web pages that are co-branded with LycosZone, the Lycos Privacy Policy and the LycosZone Children's Privacy Notice (both accessible at the bottom of each LycosZone page) govern all aspects of privacy on those pages. HowStuffWorks.com does not collect any personally identifiable information from those pages, and is not responsible for the data collection/usage policies or practices of Lycos. HowStuffWorks.com is also not responsible for any advertising that appears on the LycosZone pages. 

Here are the details of our privacy policies. This statement may change over time -- please review it periodically. 

Types of Information Collected; Uses of Information  
We collect some non-personally identifiable information automatically and some in our registration forms and online surveys. Non-personally identifiable information might include your IP address, the type of browser or operating system you use, the domain name from which you linked to our site, your zip code, your age, your income level and other general demographic information. We use this non-personally identifiable information to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site; and we may share it with our affiliates, or with our other business partners on an aggregated basis. 

Our site's registration form and online surveys may also request or require users to give us personally identifiable information (like their name, telephone number, home address and e-mail address). We may use the information from our registration forms and surveys to contact the user, but users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). We will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable data to any third party that is not an affiliate of HowStuffWorks.com unless: (i) we transfer of our business assets (as further described below); (ii) we first obtain permission from you; (iii) we need to share it with agents or contractors who perform services for us; or (iv) we are required by law to disclose it. 

Transfer of Business Assets  
As we continue to develop our business, we may be acquired, merge with another business, or acquire or buy other businesses or assets. In such transactions, both personally and non-personally identifiable information will likely be one of the transferred assets.

Our cookies cannot retrieve any other data from a hard drive or obtain an e-mail address.

Security  
While there is no such thing as "perfect" security on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of your personally identifiable information. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. However, we do not assume any liability for third-party usage of your personal information, whether obtained legally or illegally from our system.
