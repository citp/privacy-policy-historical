# DreamWorks account

**LAST UPDATED: July 2, 2015**

DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (“ **DreamWorks** “) and its subsidiaries are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with the DreamWorks mobile application (“ **App** “) or website through which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, as well as in connection with HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you and that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “ **Services** “). By using the Services or by providing your consent to your child’s use of the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you provide your consent to your child’s use of the Services, your child is an “eligible user.” Users who are not children are also “eligible users.” 

## Collection of Information

We and our service providers may collect the following information from users of the Services:

  * **Parent’s Email Address.** A child user may submit the email address of his or her parent or guardian. We use the email address to seek the consent of the parent or guardian to the child’s use of the Services. We may also use the email address to invite the parent or guardian to create a family account or otherwise interact with us.
  * **Device and Activity Information.** We collect persistent identifiers, including IP addresses, cookies and device identifiers, that provide us with information about how the Services are accessed and used (including browser and device type, time spent on the Services, pages visited and other data about website, game or App usage). We use this information solely to support our internal operations. For example, we may use the information to ensure that the Services function properly, to facilitate navigation, to calculate play or use levels, to diagnose problems and to administer a game, App or the Services. We may also use pixel tags (also known as web beacons or clear GIFs) in our emails to determine the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We do not track a user of our Services when he or she is on a third-party site or service.
  * **Analytics Information.**
    * We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about use of the Services anonymously and reports website trends, without identifying individual visitors. You can learn about Google's practices by going to [**www.google.com/policies/privacy/** **?** **partners/**](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and opt out of them by downloading the opt-out browser add-on available at [**https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout**](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 
    * We also use Adobe's analytics service, which uses cookies and web beacons to help us understand more about how our websites are used, so that we can continue to improve them. To learn more, go to [**http://www.adobe.com/content/dotcom/en/privacy/analytics.html**](http://www.adobe.com/content/dotcom/en/privacy/analytics.html). To learn how to opt out, go to [**http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4**](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4). 
  * **Information Collected through Adobe Flash Technology** : We may use Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects ("Flash LSOs") and other similar technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about use of the Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the [**Website Storage Settings Panel**](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the [**Global Storage Settings Panel**](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html) and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.



We and our service providers may also collect the following information from eligible users of the Services:

  * **Profile Information.** An eligible user may submit the following information to create a profile: name, email address, address, phone number, gender, preferred language and display name. We also collect a user name and password to permit an eligible user to access and interact with the Services. In addition, we may collect an adult’s payment card and related information in order to permit him or her to make purchases.
  * **Photos, Videos and Audio files.**
  * **Location Information.** If a user plays through an App or mobile site, we may collect the physical location of the user’s mobile device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals, in order to provide location-based services and content, such as to permit interactive game play with real world environments.
  * **Unique Identifier for Push Notifications.** We may collect a unique identifier assigned to the device used to play an App in order to deliver push notifications to an eligible user.



We may combine the information we collect from eligible users with information that we receive from other DreamWorks and third party online and offline sources, as permitted by law.

We use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the Services. If you wish to make a payment, your personal information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and it will be subject to the third party's own privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for this third party's collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

## Use and Disclosure

We use the information we collect from and about a user to provide the Services to him or her, including to measure and improve the Services and its features; to improve the user’s experience by delivering relevant content, including advertising and, if the user has agreed, marketing messages; to allow the user to participate in contests or other promotions; to provide the user with customer support; to respond to requests and inquiries; to evaluate an individual for job opportunities if he or she submits a résumé through our "careers" section; and to evaluate a reel or portfolio submitted by a user, which submission is governed by Section 7 of our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/dsppublic/info/terms). When the information collected from or about a user does not identify him or her, or allow contact with him or her or his or her device, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

We use and disclose the information we collect from and about users for these additional purposes:

  * **For our internal business purposes.** We use users’ information for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis; audits; fraud prevention; improving or modifying our services; identifying usage trends; determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns; and operating our business.
  * **To our service providers.** We may disclose users’ information to our service providers who assist us in providing and managing our services, such as by providing data analysis, payment processing, information technology, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other services.
  * **To contact the user.** We may periodically send notifications or reminders related to the Services to an eligible user or parent. We may also send promotional materials to an eligible user by email and/or direct mail, if he or she has agreed to receive them.
  * **To protect our rights and those others.** We may use or disclose a user’s information, consistent with applicable law, when we believe such disclosure is necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property and/or that of our affiliates, a user of the Services or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
  * **In connection with a disposition of our assets.** We may disclose a user’s information, consistent with applicable law, in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).



## Third Party Services

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link in the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.

## Security

We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your or your child’s interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the “ _Contacting Us_ ” section below.
