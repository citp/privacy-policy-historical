**Our collection of information**

You can visit the Site and access the information available on the Site without entering any personal information.  However, in order to access certain information, services or features that may be contained on the Site, we may require you to provide personal information such as your name, e-mail address, and phone number. For example, we will collect certain personal information if you choose to register on the Site, join our e-mail list, subscribe to our newsletter, participate in special offers, sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, sign up for our chat rooms, message boards or other public venues or send questions or comments to us via e-mail. ****

We may also collect certain demographic information (such as gender or age) and information about your interests and preferences (“preferences information”).  In many cases, such demographic and preferences information (besides age) is optional.  If we ever use any demographic or preferences information together with any Personal Information, then such demographic and preferences information will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Statement.
