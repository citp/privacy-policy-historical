<p class="question">Q: What kind of information is collected?</p>

<p>A: The web site asks that users enter first and last names to discover
how common or uncommon they are. The user may enter their own name, or anyone
else's name. For statistical purposes we track the number of searches and what
names were searched for by an individual user. A typical user will search
a number of different names (themselves, friends, family, celebrities) and determining
which search was their name would be difficult. However, it is conceivable that
a first and last name of a user could be discovered.</p>

<p>The web site also allows users to enter their e-mail address for the purpose
of notifying users of new features of this web site, or new web sites created
by the operator of this site.</p>

<p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous 
information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally
identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and
date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to
this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or
third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral
advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit 
<a href="http://networkadvertising.org">networkadvertising.org</a>.

</p><p class="question">Q: With whom do you share your data?</p>

<p>A: We do not share search data of individual users or e-mail addresses with anyone,
nor do we intend to start.</p>

<p>We do allow users to look at statistics based on the aggregate of all searches. Information
such as the most popular name searched for by all users is available. There is no way to single
out the information of one particular user from this data.</p>

<p class="question">Q: How long do you retain data?</p>
<p>A: Raw log files, including such data as IP address, operating system, browser type, as well as 
some information are kept for a 7 day period, at the end of which they are aggregated into a format
that makes discovering any personally identifiable information very difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<p>The search log including individual searches is processed approximately weekly. During processing
data connecting individual users to a particular search is removed.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Is this the final version of your privacy policy?</p>
<p>A: Probably not. Like most things on this site, our privacy policy is a work in progress. We will
very likely revise the privacy policy at some point. Any changes to the privacy policy will be posted
here. We do not, however, expect any changes in the core values of this privacy policy.
