Through our websites, we provide you with opportunities to register for information, to request assistance in evaluating our services and to take part in public forums and other community based activities which may form part of the services we offer. Your use of these tools may require you to register, providing us with information about you.

We also gather information from our web site server’s logs, including but not limited to your IP address, browser software versions and connectivity speed of your Internet connection.

 **How We Use Your Information**  
We use information we collect for the purpose of:

  * administering the websites, including services offered through them
  * diagnosing problems with our server
  * aggregating non-identifiable information, such as which countries our site visitors come from, in order to better understand our visitors’ preferences and improve the services offered through this site
  * providing you with information and other services which you have requested



HowToTuneAGuitar.org may deliver information via email and RSS to visitors who request it. We will not contact you via email without your permission to do so. From time to time, HowToTuneAGuitar.org may also send you announcements or other special offers which we think will be of value to you. If you do not wish to continue to recieve such offers, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions or link in the footer of the email you receive.

 **Log Files**  
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.

We also use third party advertisements on HowToTuneAGuitar.org to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
