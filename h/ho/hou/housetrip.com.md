It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

In the course of our business, we collect and process personal data in different ways. We may collect personal data you give us directly but we also collect data by logging how you interact with our services, for example by using cookies on this Website.

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

  * Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
  * With your consent.
  * Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.



**Marketing**

We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our Website. One way we do this is by sending you emails that contain information about your travel-related interests. We believe these emails will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites

You will receive marketing messages from us if you have given your consent, if you have requested them or if you purchased services from us and you have not opted out of receiving marketing messages.

Each time you receive an email of this type, you will be able to tell us if you no longer wish to receive them, or deny push notifications in the application, or change the settings of your mobile device to do so. You will be able to unsubscribe from marketing communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link that you will find at the bottom of each communication you receive from us.

Please note that we may continue to send you service communications, such as administrative messages about your account or transactional messages related to one of your bookings or your Holiday Lettings account. It is not possible to unsubscribe from these service communications.

  3. **With whom we share your personal data**



Holiday Lettings may share your information with other parties, including other group companies and third parties listed below. If we sell or divest our business or any part of it, and your personal data relates to such sold or divested part of our business, or if we merge with another business, we will share your personal data with the new owner of the business or our merger partner, respectively. If we are legally obliged to do so, we will share personal data to protect our customers, the site, as well as our company and our rights and property.

  * _Suppliers_ including, but not limited to, property managers or owners who fulfil travel bookings, and third party providers of other services such as photography (if such services are made available from time to time, and you choose to avail of them). Throughout the Website and its affiliated sites, all products and services provided by third party suppliers are described as such. Please note that these suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or your travel plans, to facilitate travel reservations or bookings or for other purposes consistent with the practices described in their privacy policies and terms of use.
  * _Payment solution providers_ (if you use such payment solution providers), whereby you agree that we may share data about you with the payment solution provider and vice versa in order to facilitate or assess your use of the online payment platform or for other internal purposes. Such data may include details of enquiries, bookings, transactions, refunds, chargebacks or other claims or events relating to advertisements and/or payments.
  * _Third party vendors_ who provide services or functions on our behalf, including business analytics, payment processing, customer service, marketing, public relations, distribution of surveys or promotions and fraud prevention. We may also authorise third party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including, for example, as necessary to operate features of our Website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.
  * _Business partners_ with whom we may offer products or services in conjunction, or whose products or services we think may be of interest to you. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear either with ours or separately. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal data, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third party business partners.
  * _Companies within our corporate family._ We may share your personal data within the TripAdvisor group of companies, as well as with our parent companies and domestic and international corporate affiliate companies and websites. This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services (both travel-related and other) which we think might interest you, and to facilitate rental bookings. To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your personal data, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.



We may also share your information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary:

  * to comply with legitimate and enforceable subpoenas, court orders or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
  * to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Holiday Lettings, our customers or others and in connection with our Owner and Traveller Terms of Use and other agreements.
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.



We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our Website receives or the most popular holiday destinations. This information does not contain any personal data and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.

  4. **How Long We Keep Your Personal Data**



We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure or your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.
