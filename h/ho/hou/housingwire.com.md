### [Privacy policy](http://www.housingwire.com/about/privacy-policy/)

Here at _Housing Wire_ , we like to keep things simple; and that goes for our privacy policy.

So, here’s the information you need to know:

  * We collect your email address, should you choose to provide it to us.
  * We use your email to send you a daily news update, to send the occassional communication from the editor, to conduct semi-regular reader surveys, and to roughly take a look at who’s actually reading _HW_.
  * We use cookies with minimal information in them. Sort of. See below for details.
  * We use [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/), which is covered by [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html).
  * We use [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/) to track feed stats and to process and send our daily emails



**Personal Information:** All of the personal information we collect is … are you ready? … your email address. Nothing more.

**Cookies:** _HW_ uses a cookie on your computer in order to check whether you are logged in or not. This cookie doesn’t actually do anything, since you don’t have to log in — but if you did, aren’t you glad to know it’s there?

If you need any clarification or further details on any part of this policy, please [contact us](emailto:editor@housingwire.com).
