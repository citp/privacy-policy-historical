	<div class="art_pubdate">Last Updated on 8/14/08</div>
	<div class="article_text membercenter">
	<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for The Courier newspaper and HoumaToday.com (the “Site”). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, 
	unless otherwise noted, all references to “The Courier” include HoumaToday.com and The Courier newspaper.  The Courier is
	part of The New York Times Regional Media Group (“NYTRMG”) – a division of The New York Times Company.</p>
	<p>Third party sites that HoumaToday.com links to are governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy
	policies of those websites or other websites to which they link.</p>
	<p>In this Privacy Policy, you will find answers to the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#1">What information do we gather about you?</a></li>
		<li><a href="#2">What do we do with the information we gather about you?</a></li>
		<li><a href="#3">What is our e-mail policy?</a></li>
		<li><a href="#4">With whom do we share the information that we gather?</a></li>
		<li><a href="#5">How do I change or update my personal information?</a></li>
		<li><a href="#6">How do I opt-out from receiving promotional offers?</a></li>
		<li><a href="#7">Is my information protected?</a></li>
		<li><a href="#8">Other information: Compliance with legal process</a></li>
		<li><a href="#9">Other information: Children's Guidelines</a></li>
		<li><a href="#10">Other information: Changes to this Privacy Policy</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="1">What information do we gather about you?</h2>
	<p>The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online
	discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.</p>
	<h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
	<h3>Registration for our Web sites</h3>
	<p>Anyone can view the Site, but a free registration process is required to access the full range of information and services we offer.</p>
	<p>HoumaToday.com requires that you supply a unique e-mail address and demographic information (zip code, age, sex, household income to register. By using 
	HoumaToday.com, you are agreeing to the terms of our <a href="/termsofservice">Member Agreement</a>).</p>
	<h3>Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers</h3>
	<p>On occasion, The Courier collects personal information from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information
	is to be shared with a third party other than The Courier, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you
	may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer. </p>
	<h3>Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research</h3>
	<p>The Courier may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web sites, on the phone
	or through the mail. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we
	notify you otherwise at the time of collection.</p>
	<h3>Mobile Messaging Service</h3>
	<p>We may elect to offer certain text messaging services (the “SMS Service”).  We use the information collected from your interaction with the SMS Service solely for the 
	purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed, except as required by law.  We will not use your
	phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about
	your SMS Service usage: their practices are governed by their own privacy policies. </p>
	<p>The Courier collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and
	The Courier. When you send a text message to The Courier or via The Courier, we log the incoming phone number, the
	wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our
	Mobile Services. The Courier uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service. </p>
	<h4>Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology</h4>
	<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
	<p>As is standard practice on many Web sites, The Courier uses “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as
	to help us understand which parts of our Web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. Users who do not accept
	cookies from the domain "HoumaToday.com" cannot access most areas of our sites.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to place a The Courier Company cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not
	see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.</p>
	<p>For detailed information about our use of cookies, see the Frequently Asked Questions area of our Member Center.</p>
	<p>NYTRMG, of which we are a part, is currently using Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our
	visitors and customers to administer our Web site and constantly improve its quality. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of HoumaToday.com is owned and used by
	The Courier or NYTRMG. The Courier reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web site visitors
	for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our
	visitors and customers. For more information about Omniture's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to 
	<a href="http://www.omniture.com/policy.html">www.omniture.com/policy.html</a></p>
	<p>We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.</p>
	<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
	<p>Advertisers on HoumaToday.com may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our Web site, and in these instances may use a software technology
	called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags/pixel tags) to better manage advertising on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
	in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users. For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing
	them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page
	and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind, we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs
	nor additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser.</p>
	<h3>IP Addresses</h3>
	<p>The Courier logs IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting 
	purposes. We use the IP address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site.</p>
	<h3>Log Files</h3>
	<p>Log data is only used in aggregate to analyze usage of our Web.</p>
	<h2 id="2">What do we do with the information we gather about you?</h2>
	<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
	<p>The Courier may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of subscribers, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for product
	development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base. We also use such information to allow advertising to be targeted, in
	aggregate, to the users for whom such advertising is most pertinent. The Courier may share personal information with NYTRMG for analysis purposes, 
	including analysis to improve customer relationships.</p>
	<h3>Products and Service Message from The Courier</h3>
	<p>From time to time, we may provide subscribers with information and offers about other products and services offered by The Courier, including
	subscriptions and other premium products and services. This information will only be shared internally. If you do not wish to receive such information and offers, you
	may opt-out. To opt-out of offers by mail please go <a href="&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;https://www.formrouter.net/forms01@NYTRM/HTC_DNM.html&#10;&#9;">here</a>.</p>
	<h3>Banner Advertising</h3> 
	<p>We may use behavioral, demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they
	are most pertinent. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be
	receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. We will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.</p>
	<h3>User Generated Content (Message Boards, Forums, Reader Reviews and Chats)</h3>
	<p>We offer message boards for readers in a number of areas throughout our Web sites. The message boards are currently hosted and managed by Grouppee, a third party
	vendor. Any information you disclose when posting to a message board, along with your message board screen name or ID, becomes public and may be used by
	The Courier for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. Chats are also currently hosted by Grouppee, and any posting to a chat
	becomes public as soon as they are published online. For more information, see the Terms of Service.</p>
	<h3>E-Mail Newsletters</h3> 
	<p>If you choose to receive them, The Courier will periodically send you e-mail newsletters or promotional e-mail about services offered by 
	The Courier and its advertisers. For details about The Courier e-mail, please see the next section, “What Is Our E-mail Policy?”.</p>
	<h2 id="3">What is our e-mail policy?</h2>
	<p>The Courier complies fully with the federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. We will not share, sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your
	e-mail address without your permission. If you feel you have received an e-mail from us in error, please contact 
	<a href="mailto:&#10;&#9;online@houmatoday.com&#10;&#9;">
	online@houmatoday.com</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Account and Service-Related E-mail:</h3>
	<p>The Courier reserves the right to send you e-mail relating to your account status. This includes order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, notices
	of credit-card problems, other transactional e-mails and notifications about major changes to the Site and/or to our Privacy Policy. If you have registered for online
	discussions or other services, you may receive e-mail specific to your participation in those activities.</p>
	<h3>E-mail Newsletters:</h3>
	<p>We offer e-mail newsletters. If you no longer wish to receive a specific newsletter, follow the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter. </p>
	<h3>Promotional E-mail:</h3>
	<p>If you chose to receive them during the registration process, we may periodically e-mail you messages about products and services that we think may
	be of interest to you. You can choose not to receive messages in the future by either (1) following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each e-mail, or
	(2) you can <a href="/section/manage/">opt-out</a>.</p>
	<p>From time to time, The Courier may obtain e-mail addresses from third party sources to be used for promotional e-mails. You can choose not to receive
	messages in the future by either (1) following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each e-mail, or (2) you can <a href="/section/manage/">opt-out</a>.</p>
	<h3>Survey E-mail:</h3>
	<p>If you have not opted out, we may send you an e-mail inviting you to participate in user surveys, asking for feedback on HoumaToday.com and existing or prospective
	products and services, as well as information to better understand our users. User surveys greatly help us to improve our Web site, and any information we obtain in such
	surveys will not be shared with third parties, except in aggregate form. </p>
	<h3>E-mails From You:</h3>
	<p>If you send us e-mails, you should be aware that information disclosed in e-mails may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available to others. We suggest that
	you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in e-mails. We will use your e-mail address to respond directly to your questions or
	comments.</p>
	<h3>E-mail This Article Feature:</h3>
	<p>HoumaToday.com readers may use this feature to send links to articles to others through e-mail. The e-mail address(es) that you supply to this service will only be
	used to send the requested article.</p>
	<h2 id="4">With whom do we share the information that we gather?</h2>
	<p>If you have registered to one of our sites, The Courier will not sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your e-mail address or any information
	that personally identifies you without your permission. We do, however, share information about our audience in aggregate form.</p>
	<p>If you are a print subscriber to The Courier and you subscribed either by mail, phone or online, we may exchange or rent your name and mailing address
	(but not your e-mail address) with other reputable companies that offer marketing information or products through direct mail. If you prefer that we do not share this
	information, you may <a href="/section/manage/">opt-out</a>.</p>
	<h3>Service Providers</h3>
	<p>We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics
	or promotions management. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. These service providers are restricted from using this
	data in any way other than to provide services for The Courier, and they may not share or resell this data.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to disclose your opt-out information to third parties so they can suppress your name from future solicitations, in accordance with applicable laws. We
	may occasionally release personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena. (For more information, see the “Compliance with legal
	process” section of this policy.)</p>

	<h2 id="8">Other Information: Compliance with Legal Process</h2>
	<p>We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with
	legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web sites; or (4) protect the personal safety or property
	of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed
