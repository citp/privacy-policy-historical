We have created this Online Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) to let you know what “personal information” we collect when you and others use this Website, how we use and share the personal information we collect, and some of the steps we take to protect your privacy.&nbsp; “Personal information” is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.&nbsp; Examples of personal information include your name, address, and email address.<br><br>Our Commitment to Transparency.&nbsp; House Party is committed to providing the information you need to make informed choices about the ways you use this Website and the personal information you share with us.&nbsp; If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us by email at privacy@houseparty.com or by writing us at Privacy Officer, House Party, Inc., One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington, NY, U.S.A. 10533.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</strong><br><br>By browsing or using this Website, you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS POLICY, YOU MAY NOT BROWSE OR USE THIS WEBSITE. <br><strong><br>Our Participation in the U.S./EU Safe Harbor Program. </strong><br><br>As part of our commitment to privacy, House Party adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and the guidelines provided in the U.S. Safe Harbor Frequently Asked Questions (together, the “U.S. Safe Harbor Framework”).&nbsp; To learn more about the U.S. Safe Harbor Program, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.<br><br>As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor Program, we participate in the Safe Harbor Privacy Dispute Resolution Program administered by the Direct Marketing Association (“DMA”).&nbsp; If you have any concerns regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework, you should contact us by email at privacy@houseparty.com or by writing us at Privacy Officer, House Party, Inc., One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington, NY, U.S.A. 10533.&nbsp; If your concern is not addressed to your satisfaction, then, at your request, the DMA will review your complaint and work with us to resolve the dispute.&nbsp; To learn more about the DMA Safe Harbor Privacy Dispute Resolution Program, click here.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><strong>This Privacy Policy is Part of Our Terms of Service. </strong><br><br>This Privacy Policy is part of the Terms of Service that govern your use of this Website.&nbsp; A link to our Terms of Service is provided on every page of this Website. <br><br><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br><br>As we add new features and functionality to this Website, we may need to update or revise this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We reserve the right to do so, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version on this Website.&nbsp; These changes will be effective as of the date we post the revised version on this Website.&nbsp; They will apply only to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised version.&nbsp; Your use of this Website following any such change constitutes your consent to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.&nbsp; For this reason, it is important to review this Privacy Policy regularly.&nbsp; If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will provide a notice at the top of this Privacy Policy for at least 30 days after the new effective date. <br><br>You may access the current version of this Privacy Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked “Privacy Policy” at the bottom of each page of this Website.&nbsp; For your convenience, we post the effective date of this Privacy Policy at the top of this page, so that you can see at a glance whether this Privacy Policy has changed since your last visit. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Privacy Notices</strong><br><br>This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by “privacy notices” posted on this Website.&nbsp; These privacy notices provide a level of detail that we cannot provide in this more general description of our privacy practices.&nbsp; For example, certain pages of this Website contain privacy notices providing details about the personal information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. <br><br><strong>Country-Specific Notices</strong><br><br>Privacy requirements vary from country to country.&nbsp; To meet these requirements we have included certain “country-specific notices” as part of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; To see if there is one for your country, click here.&nbsp; If any of the terms of a country-specific notice are different than the general terms of this policy, the terms of the country-specific notice will supplement or amend this policy, but only to the extent that the laws of that country apply to the collection of personal information through this Website. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Other Agreements</strong><br><br>Click-Through Agreements.&nbsp; When you sign up to use a special feature or password-protected area of this Website, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of the special feature or password-protected area.&nbsp; In such cases, you will be asked to expressly consent to the special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked "I agree."&nbsp; This type of agreement is known as a "click-through" agreement.&nbsp; If any of the terms of the click-through agreement are different than the terms of this policy, the terms of the click-through agreement will supplement or amend this Privacy Policy, but only with respect to the matters governed by the "click-through agreement."<br><br>Release, Waiver of Liability and Indemnity Agreement.&nbsp; When you apply to host a House Party event or use this Website to accept an invitation to attend a House Party event, you will be asked to agree to our Release, Waiver of Liability and Indemnity Agreement (the “Release”).&nbsp; The terms of the Release supplement and amend this Privacy Policy, but only with respect to the subject matter of the Release.&nbsp; Please read the Release carefully.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the terms of the Release, you may not host or attend a House Party event. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect Through This Website?</strong><br><br>We collect three types of personal information through this Website:&nbsp; the personal information you knowingly choose to provide or post when you use this Website; personal information collected from your browser or using standard Web technologies, such as cookies; and the personal information others may provide about you when they post User Generated Content on this Website.<br><br>Information You Provide. We collect the personal information you knowingly provide (using your mouse and keyboard) when you use this Website. The information we collect depends on how you use this Website. For example, if you apply to host a party, we collect the information you provide as part of the online application process. If you post photographs, comments or other User Generated Content on a party page, we collect that information also.&nbsp; All postings must comply with the requirements for User Generated Content as set forth in our Terms of Service.&nbsp; For more information about User Generated Content, click here.<br><br>House Party Store.&nbsp; The House Party Store is operated by Amazon.com.&nbsp; When you make a purchase at the House Party Store, the information you provide, including your credit card information, goes directly from your computer to a server operated by Amazon.com. To learn how Amazon.com uses the information you provide, please review Amazon.com’s Privacy Notice.&nbsp; Amazon.com does not share your personal information with us.&nbsp; Amazon.com does share certain aggregate data with us, such as statistics regarding the number of transactions or average dollar amount of transactions generated by referrals from this Website.&nbsp; The House Party Store is only availably on the English-language version of this Website.<br><br>Information Others Post on This Website.&nbsp; The User Generated Content others post on this Website may contain your personal information.&nbsp; For example, if you attend a party, someone may post photographs of you and others that were taken at the party.&nbsp; All postings must comply with the requirements for User Generated Content as set forth in our Terms of Service.&nbsp; For more information about User Generated Content, click here.<br><br>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.&nbsp; We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser.&nbsp; This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit.&nbsp; Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.&nbsp; Generally, we do not link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you by name.&nbsp; You should know, however, that when you access this Website by clicking on a link in an email or other electronic communication you receive from us, your browser tells us that someone has clicked on a particular link in a communication addressed to you.&nbsp; We collect that information to improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. <br><br>More About IP Addresses.&nbsp; An “IP address” is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet.&nbsp; It is used to identify your computer’s “location” in cyberspace, so that the information you request can be delivered to you.&nbsp; If you use a dial-up connection or a connection that assigns dynamic IP addresses, your computer will be assigned a new IP Address each time you connect to the Internet.&nbsp; If, however, your computer is permanently connected to the Internet using a static IP address, the IP address assigned to your computer will generally be the same each time you use your computer. <br><br>IP addresses do not include your name, email address or other information that identifies you personally, but in some cases, they can be used to identify you.&nbsp; For example, if you have created a user identity, for example, by joining House Party, we may link your IP address to information that identifies you personally.&nbsp; In addition, if, for example, we suspect fraud or a threat to the security of this Website, we may share our server logs – which contain visitors’ IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative authorities, who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.&nbsp; Because IP addresses can be used, under certain circumstances, to trace and identify particular individuals, House Party treats them as personal information. <br><br>Cookies and Similar Technologies.&nbsp; We use "cookies" and other Web technologies to collect information and support certain features of this Website.&nbsp; For example, we may use these technologies to<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • collect information about the ways visitors use this Website – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • to manage and determine the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • to support the features and functionality of this Website — for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits to this Websites; and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • to personalize your experience when you use this Website.<br><br>Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you personally.&nbsp; If, however, you have created a user identity, for example, by joining House Party or applying to host a party, we may link the information we collect using these Web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.<br><br>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.&nbsp; You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave this Website.&nbsp; Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit this Website, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Website. <br><br><strong>How Do We Use Your Personal Information? </strong><br>Generally.&nbsp; We use the personal information we collect through this Website<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to provide the information, services and products you request;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to process your application to host a party;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
