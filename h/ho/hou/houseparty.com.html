These Terms govern your access to and use of our Houseparty services, including our Houseparty mobile applications (“Apps”), our websites, including the website located at <a href="http://houseparty.com">http://houseparty.com</a> (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

<h2 id="1-basic-terms">1. Basic Terms</h2>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p>You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Life On Air and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</p>

<h3 id="agreement-to-terms">Agreement to Terms</h3>

<p>Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. The Services that Life On Air provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Life On Air may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p>

<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

<p>If you want to use certain features of the Services you’ll have to create an account and become a registered user (“User”). It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your account. <strong>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</strong></p>

<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. Life On Air cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not you know about them.</p>

<h3 id="advertisements">Advertisements</h3>

<p>The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the content or information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by Life On Air on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Life On Air granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Life On Air and its subsidiary, third party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.</p>

<h2 id="2-privacy">2. Privacy</h2>

<p>Any information that you provide to Life On Air is subject to our <a href="#houseparty-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Life On Air.</p>

<p>As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.</p>

<h2 id="3-using-the-services">3. Using the Services</h2>

<p>The Services enable you to participate in group video chats with and send messages to other Users. When you use the App, you will be able to join a video chat with a User with whom you are connected on the Services (each a “Connection”). You can add Connections by inviting them to connect on the Services.</p>

<p>Once you are in a video chat, your Connections and any other participants’ Connections are able to join the same video chat session. If you wish to limit your video chat to your direct Connections, you can lock your video chat session. If you do not lock your video chat session, a friend of someone with whom you are video chatting may join that current video chat session, with or without an invite from you and whether or not you know him or her. However, if a User that isn’t your Connection is about to join a video chat session you are in, you’ll receive a notice that such a participant is joining the session. The Services may also suggest that you invite a Connection that you and one or more participants in a video chat session have in common to join a video chat session.</p>

<h3 id="contacts">Contacts</h3>

<p>If you choose to import your personal contacts from your mobile device we will access your personal contacts in order to identify Users that you may know that are using the Services and to provide other Users with suggestions for potential Connections based on mutual contacts.</p>

<h3 id="invitations">Invitations</h3>

<p>We may offer you the opportunity to invite your Connections or other contacts to join your group video chats or otherwise enjoy the Services. If you choose to invite one or more of your Connections or contacts using text messaging (SMS) or another communications app we may suggest content for the message (which you may be able to edit in certain instances). You may send invitations via the messaging functionality on your device or through text messages generated by the Services. If you choose to send such invitations, you represent to Life On Air that the recipients of such invitations have consented to receive such messages from you, and that those recipients do not consider such messages unwanted or unsolicited.</p>

Unless you timely provide Life On Air with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice (as defined below in the Section titled “Your Choices”), you acknowledge and agree that you and Life On Air are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Life On Air otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section.

<h3 id="arbitration-process">Arbitration Process</h3>

<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

<h3 id="arbitration-location-and-procedure">Arbitration Location and Procedure</h3>

<p>Unless you and Life On Air otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Life On Air submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

<h3 id="arbitrators-decision">Arbitrator’s Decision</h3>

<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.

The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Life On Air will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>

<h3 id="fees">Fees</h3>

<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Life On Air will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

<h3 id="changes">Changes</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “General Terms” section below regarding changes to these Terms, if Life On Air changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:hello@houseparty.com">hello@houseparty.com</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Life On Air’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Life On Air in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

<h3 id="your-choices">Your Choices</h3>

<p>If you don’t want to settle Disputes by arbitration as described above, you will notify Life On Air by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:hello@houseparty.com">hello@houseparty.com</a>) telling us that you don’t want to use arbitration, within thirty (30) days of the date on which you agreed to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”), and consequently you agree that all Disputes will be resolved exclusively by a court located in San Francisco, California. If you don’t provide Life On Air with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except for a Small Claims Action and an IP Protection Action as set forth above.</p>

<h2 id="13-general-terms">13. General Terms</h2>

<p>The failure of Life On Air to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Life On Air’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Life On Air. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Life On Air’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Life On Air may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.

For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
These Terms and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between Life On Air and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Life On Air that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Life On Air and you regarding the Services and Content.</p>

<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time; the most current version will always be at <a href="https://houseparty.com/privacy/">https://houseparty.com/privacy/</a>. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via email to the email associated with your account or through the Services.

<h2 id="31-types-of-personal-information-we-collect">3.1 Types of Personal Information We Collect</h2>

<p>Life on Air collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective, and former clients, customers, Users, visitors, and guests (collectively “Individuals”).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Information You Provide Directly to Us.</strong> When you use the Services or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an Account with us, responding to surveys, requesting Services or information, or contacting us directly, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information:</li>
  <li><strong>Communications with Us.</strong> We may collect Personal Information from you such as name, email address, phone number or mailing address when you choose to request information about our Services, register for an account or a promotion that we may offer from time to time, request to receive customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.</li>
  <li><strong>Contacts &amp; Phone Numbers</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When you give us authorization, we will access your contacts information from your address book on your mobile device or computer (“Contacts”). We will use your Contacts in order to identify other Users that you may know and to provide you or other Users with suggestions for other Users with whom you or they may want to connect or invite to join a video chat session. We may also use your Contacts with your authorization if you choose to invite your friends to sign up for the Services.</li>
      <li>For example, the Services may indicate a Connection that you and one or more participants in a video chat session have in common which you may want to invite to join a video chat session. The Services may also suggest to another User a potential Connection based on mutual contacts.</li>
      <li>In addition, if you use your phone number to verify your account, we may use your phone number to suggest to you other Users to add as Connections or suggest you as a potential Connection to other Users based on the Contacts they upload.</li>
      <li>Note, however, that we will never share your phone number or the phone numbers of third parties in your Contacts with anyone else.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests.</strong> Occasionally, Life on Air may run sweepstakes and contests.  We ask those who enter in the sweepstakes or contests to provide contact information (e.g., an e-mail address).  If you participate in a sweepstakes or contest, your contact information may be used to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes.  In accordance with the laws of your jurisdiction, as a participant you will have the opportunity to opt-out of any communications that are not related to awarding prizes.</li>

We may collect certain information that your mobile or other device sends when you use such Services, like a device identifier, user settings, location information, mobile carrier, and the operating system of your device. Mobile and desktop versions of our Services may require that Users log in with an account. In such cases, information about use of mobile and desktop versions of the Services may be associated with accounts. In addition, we may enable Individuals to download an application, widget, or other tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices.  These tools may transmit Personal Information to us to enable Individuals to access accounts and to enable us to track use of these tools.

<h2 id="33-cookies-pixel-tags--web-beacons-analytics-information-interest-based-advertising-and-other-technologies">3.3 Cookies, Pixel Tags / Web Beacons, Analytics Information, Interest-Based Advertising, and Other Technologies</h2>

<p>We, as well as Third Parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, log data and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services, and to recognize you across devices.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device’s hard disk when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services, to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept Cookies. If you do not want cookies from Life On Air or other services, you can change your settings to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the services you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable Cookies.</li>
  <li><strong>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.</strong> A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon, web bug, or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the User’s hard drive, pixel tags are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</li>
  <li><strong>Social Media Widgets:</strong> Our Services include social media features such as, integration of Facebook friends as suggested app contacts, and sharing features native to iOS and Android devices (that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive mini-programs). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting through our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a Third Party or hosted directly through our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics.</strong> We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop website content. This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. You can opt out of Google’s collection and Processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Log Data.</strong> Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, the Users with whom you video chat, access date and time spent on features of the Services and other statistics and Cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, participate in a video chat session, or interact with our email or push notifications. Life on Air uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. For instance, Life on Air may provide you with recommendations based on your use of the Services.</li>
  <li><strong>Location Information.</strong> In addition to profile information, if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or by accessing your computer’s or mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location. We may use and store information about your location, to provide features of our Services, such as providing location specific filters, and to improve and customize the Services with Content that has been tagged near your location. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your computer or mobile device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operationally Necessary. We may use Cookies, pixel tags, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Site, Services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our Site, Services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;</li>
  <li>Performance Related. We may use Cookies, pixel tags, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Site, Services, applications and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Services, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our content, applications, services, or tools;</li>
  <li>Functionality Related. We may use Cookies, pixel tags, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Site, Services, applications, or tools. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our Services;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to opt-out of the Technologies we employ on our sites, services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits.</p>

<h2 id="34-third-party-websites-social-media-platforms-and-software-development-kits">3.4	Third-Party Websites, Social Media Platforms, and Software Development Kits</h2>

<p>The Services may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Site or other Services. We use Third-Party software development kits (“SDKs”), such as the Facebook SDK, as part of the functionality of our Services (e.g., to suggest friends from Facebook or other platforms for your addition to your app contact list). Third-Party SDKs may allow Third Parties including advertisers to collect your personal information to provide content that is more relevant to you. You may opt out of tracking by accessing the Third Party’s settings on your device and disabling the tracking function for that Third Party or by choosing not to enable such SDKs in the settings for our Services.</p>

<p>These other domains, websites and services are not controlled by us, and we do not endorse or make any representations about Third-Party websites or social media platforms. We encourage our Users to read the privacy policies of each and every website and application with which they interact. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. Visiting or connecting to these other websites, services or applications is at your own risk.</p>

<p>Our Services may contain private messaging features, links and interactive features with various social media platforms (e.g., widgets to suggest friends from Facebook or other platforms to add to your contacts). If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our Services. You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your information when interacting with a social media platform, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes.</p>

      <li>In addition to your profile, your Connections will also be able to see the last time you were online, and your Connections (including a list of recent Connections).</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify Users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.
