   <p align="justify">Welcome to <em><a href="http://www.houseparty.com" target="_blank">www.houseparty.com</a></em> (the “<u>Website</u>”) operated by House Party, Inc., a Delaware   corporation with offices at One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington,   NY&nbsp; 10533 (“<u>House Party</u>”, “<u>we</u>”, “<u>our</u>”,   or “<u>us</u>”).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is intended to inform   you about how your personally identifiable information (“<u>PII</u>”)   and other information is collected by us in operating the Website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
   <p>&nbsp;<br>
       <strong>How does the Website Work?</strong> &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">The Website offers visitors   to the Website (“<u>you</u>” or “<u>your</u>”) the opportunity   to browse and interact with certain features on the Website. &nbsp;   By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your   information by House Party as described herein.&nbsp; House Party reserves   the right to change how we handle the information we collect through   the Website at any time.&nbsp; We will update this Privacy Policy to   reflect any changes in our privacy collection and handling practices,   and will indicate that changes to this Privacy Policy have been made   by listing a new date under “Last Modified” at the end of this Agreement.&nbsp;   Such changes will take effect immediately once posted to the Website. &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify"><strong>What type of PII does   House Party collect from you and how do we use it<em>?</em></strong> </p>
   <p align="justify">&nbsp;<br>
     House Party does not require you to provide us with any personally identifiable   information (“<u>PII</u>”) in order to browse the Website.&nbsp;   However, in order to use certain interactive features of the Website,   you must provide certain PII to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, House   Party requests that hosts of parties provide us with their names, email   addresses, and other like information.&nbsp; However, unless you provide   your PII to House Party through the Website, we will not collect any   PII from you.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">House Party may provide   your PII to entities who work on our behalf or with us.&nbsp; These   entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests in connection   with the Website and to help us communicate with you about different   resources offered as part of the Website.&nbsp; For instance, we may   transfer information submitted by you, including PII, to service providers   and other third parties who assist us in running the Website. &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">House Party may also   share your PII with third parties for direct marketing purposes, and   you acknowledge that the handling of your PII by such third parties   will not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you   would rather us not share your PII with the any third party for direct   marketing purposes, please either (1) do not submit PII to House Party   through the Website or (2) indicate your desire for us not to share   your PII with third parties for direct marketing purposes by submitting   such a request in writing (an “<u>Opt-Out Request</u>”) to us at:   House Party, Inc., One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington, NY&nbsp;   10533 or by email at &lt;URL&gt;.</p>
   <p align="justify">Please note that it may   take several weeks for us to comply with your Opt-Out Request, and until   we are able to comply with such request we may continue to use your   PII as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Please note that after   receiving your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name   and other PII to help us ensure that we can honor such request, to communicate   to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct   marketing.&nbsp; </p>
   <p align="justify">Please note that if we   receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PII with a third   party for direct marketing purposes, House Party may not have the ability   to control the use of such PII by such third party (or any other party   to whom such third party may have transferred your PII), and in such   an event you agree that House Party shall not be responsible or liable,   directly or indirectly, for any damages or loss caused or alleged to   be caused by or in connection with the use of such PII by any such third   party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition.&nbsp; If you   are concerned about House Party sharing your PII with third parties   or otherwise transferring or disposing your PII, you should not provide   your PII to House Party.&nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">We may also release your   PII to third parties if we believe such release is necessary to comply   with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), to   apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property,   if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure   of such PII, or as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation,   merger, or sale of substantially all of the assets of House Party.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">Please keep in mind that   some of the content you post to the Website is publicly viewable to   all visitors to the Website or to certain third parties recipients designated   by you.&nbsp; Do not post any content to a publicly viewable portion   of the Website or send any content to a third party that you don’t   want others to see.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p><strong>What other information does   House Party collect?&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">We also may collect anonymous   and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating   the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods.&nbsp; Cookies   are small text files that identify your computer.&nbsp; We may use cookies   to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features,   identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete   transactions.&nbsp; An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage   that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor   who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer   to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes   from and the time that such webpage was viewed.&nbsp; Tags may be associated   with cookie information.&nbsp; We may also use such anonymous and aggregate   information for promotional purposes. &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">If you do not want us   to track such information about you, you can set your browser to warn   you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts   you to their presence.&nbsp; You can also adjust the settings in your   browser to refuse all cookies. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p><strong>How do we store information?</strong> &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">While we take reasonable   efforts to protect PII provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such   information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances   or by the unauthorized acts of others.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify"><strong>Does   House Party provide links to other websites? </strong>&nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">House Party&nbsp;may provide   links to other websites or resources of possible interest to&nbsp;you.&nbsp; Because   we have no control over unaffiliated websites to which we provide links,   the collection and use of your PII and other information by such websites   shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and   not this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify"><strong>What are our policies   regarding children?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">You must be eighteen   (18) years of age or older in order to enter the Website.&nbsp;&nbsp;   House Party does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under thirteen   (13) years of age.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p><strong>Do we have a mechanism to address   complaints about the handling of information that we collect?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">If you have questions   or concerns about any of our information collection or handling practices,   please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@houseparty.com">help@houseparty.com</a>. &nbsp;<br>
