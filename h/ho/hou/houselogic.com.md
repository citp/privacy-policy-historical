### PRIVACY POLICY FOR HOUSELOGIC

The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS® (NAR) recognizes the importance of protecting the personal information you provide to websites owned and/or controlled by NAR. HouseLogic (referred to as HL, we, us and our), one of the NAR sites, (Site) has its own privacy policy, which is below (Privacy Policy). This Privacy Policy explains the collection and use of Personal Identifiable information entered on our Site; what we do to secure the information; and other important matters. By using our Site, you consent to our processing your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and any amendments thereto.  For a further understanding of the rules governing the HL Site, you should also review the “Terms of Use”.

**1.     Information We Collect   **

When you access and use the Site, it may use technology to automatically collect certain information about you, including your activities over time and across third-party websites, apps or other online services. This is called “behavioral tracking.”  NAR does not respond to “do not track” signals at this time. 

Generally, two types of information are collected from Site visitors, Personal Identifiable Information and Non-identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information provided by the user, including but not limited to: your name and residential or business address, and user names and passwords assigned to you as a part of registering to use the site.         

Non-identifiable Information is tracking or browser information that may be automatically gathered when you visit the Site or open an email from HL, via cookies or otherwise, for example, IP address, browser type and the pages you visit.

**2.     How We Collect Information **

A.    Through the Registration Process: When you become a registered user of the Site, we may gather the information you provided as part of the registration process, including but not limited to, first name and your zip code. We also obtain information regarding your interests as you tell us about your plans and goals for your property through your use of the Your Binder feature which you may set up as a part of the site.  

B.    Electronically Through Cookies and Other Means: Cookies are small files that are sent and stored on your computer when you visit our Site or when you open certain emails from the Site that enable us to recognize your computer the next time you visit the Site. There are two types of cookies, Persistent Cookies and Session Cookies.

Persistent Cookie is a cookie that remains on your computer after you exit your browser and can be used by your browser on future visits to the Site or by third party vendors when you visit certain other websites in order to allow advertisers and content owners to improve your web experience. These cookies may be used to tailor ad content of other sites that you may visit in the future. They may also collect data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, and other clickstream data, none of which will include personal information about you.

Session Cookie is a cookie that is deleted from your computer once you disconnect from, or leave, our Site. The use of cookies is considered industry standard.

Web Beacons are electronic images or a web programming code included in our web page that is used for several purposes, including but not limited to, counting visitors to the Site and counting particular articles viewed. Additionally, this code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website, allowing us to collect analytics about our traffic, customize our services, and send you ads about our services. You may also disable our web beacons in our emails by turning images “off” in your email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.

Embedded Scripts are programming codes designed to collect information about your use of the Site, including links that you select. This code is only active while you are connected to the site and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

Data you provide for promotions or contests on our Site, which may be sponsored by third parties, may include information about you and how to contact you and that information could be used by us or disclosed to third parties who have sponsored or otherwise contributed to the contest or sweepstakes.
