                <li><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology:</strong> HometownQuotes.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in its database. Additionally, HometownQuotes.com may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> "Cookies" are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this website. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our website. You can disable cookies, although our website may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.</li>
                        <li><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows HometownQuotes.com to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, HometownQuotes.com may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in HometownQuotes.com’s database.</li>
                        <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> HometownQuotes.com automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Computer Profiles:</strong> HometownQuotes.com may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors.

When you provide us with Personal Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Data analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by a client of HometownQuotes.com.</li>
                        <li><strong>New Technology:</strong> The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, HometownQuotes.com strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.</li>
