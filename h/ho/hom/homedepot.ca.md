Our affiliates and service providers may have access to your personal information on a confidential basis to the extent necessary to perform their functions. In no event will these companies have the right to use your personal information for any reason other than to provide you with those specific services, except as may be permitted by law.

We may share personal information about our consumers with these service providers in order to provide you with tailored information about products and services and special offers. These service providers also have their own privacy statements that set out the manner in which they will collect, use and disclose personal information. We encourage you to review each service provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your application for such financial products.

**To provide extended warranty services.** If you purchase a The Home Depot Extended Warranty Service you will be required to provide information such as your name and address to our warranty service providers. While these service providers are limited by contract in the way they may use your information to provide The Home Depot Extended Warranty Services, we encourage you to review each service provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your personal information for such services.

**Data Sharing for Catalog Mailings.** With your consent, we may share your name, address and transactional information about products you have purchased from our catalogs with third party companies so that you may receive future catalog offerings about products and services that may be of interest to you. To opt-out of having your information shared with third party companies for this purpose, please see the section below entitled Your Privacy Preferences.

**With any successor to all or part of our business.** For example, if all or part of our business is sold we may transfer information we have about you as part of that transaction.

**If we think we have to in order to comply with the law.** For example, we and our Canadian, US and foreign affiliates and service providers may disclose information to respond to a court order or subpoena.

#### Security

When you place orders on our websites, all of your order information, including your credit card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our websites from capturing and viewing your personal information. 

While we use industry standard means to protect our websites and your information, the Internet is not 100% secure. The measures we use are appropriate for the type of information we collect. We cannot promise that your use of our websites or mobile applications will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. Online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not share your password. 

We maintain your personal information for as long as required for the purposes set out in this Privacy and Security Statement, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

#### Links

Our websites contain links to third party websites. If you click on one of those links, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This Privacy and Security Statement does not apply to the information practices of those websites. You should read the privacy policies of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for the personal information practices of third party websites.

#### Our Tracking Techniques

**Tracking Tools We Use**

We collect personal and other information about users over time and across different Web sites when you use this website or service or our applications for mobile phones, tablets or other smart devices. We also have third party service providers that collect personal information this way. We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools to collect this information. These may include browser and flash cookies. We may also use web beacons and similar technologies. We (and our third party service providers) use these tools:

  * To track visitors to our websites.
  * To recognize returning customers.
  * To learn what site referred you to our websites.
  * To store your password if you are registered on our website.
  * To personalize your experience in our website and on third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications.
  * To collect and store geographic data determined by the IP address of the visitor’s computer. 
  * To optimize and tailor our websites
  * To make product recommendations and provide you with advertising content in which we think you will be interested. As part of this customization, we may observe your behaviors on our mobile applications, our websites or on other websites. We may also get information about your browsing history from our trusted business partners and vendors.
  * So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors and mobile application users, and their respective interests.
  * To provide correct pricing and ads for the local store you select.



**Controlling Our Tracking Tools**

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) . Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings. If you configure your computer to block cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our websites. Your mobile device may not give you the ability to control cookies. If you wish to block cookies on our mobile applications, you will need to delete the application from your mobile device. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. 

**Our “Do Not Track” policy:** Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

**Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads**

We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads. This may include ads served on our websites or mobile applications. This may also include ads served on other companies’ websites. These ads may be based on information about your online activity collected by us or third parties on our websites or other third party websites. For example, information collected when you register for a website, like your zip code may be used to deliver an ad for people in your area.

To learn more about interest-based ads and to opt out of certain types of interest-based advertising, [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

#### My Account Registration and Use

My Account registration is an optional service provided by our website. You do not have to register to browse or shop online. When you register, you are asked for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and a username and password that you select. You may also optionally provide information regarding your interests and home improvement projects or register your credit cards. This information may be used to help make your online shopping quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information.
