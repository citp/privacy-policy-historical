Privacy & Security Statement

We know that your privacy is very important to you. That's why protecting any personal information, such as your name, address, email address or phone number that you provide to us is of the utmost importance to Home Depot of Canada Inc., and its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates, brands and other Home Depot companies (the "Home Depot"). As a result, we have prepared this Privacy and Security Statement to let you know about the manner in which we collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage the personal information you entrust to us at any of our Home Depot store locations (the "Stores"), through any Home Depot Call Centres (the "Call Centres"), through Home Depot websites (the "Sites"), or through our authorized service providers ("Service Providers").

When you provide personal information at our Stores, our Call Centres, our Sites and to our Service Providers, you are consenting to the manner in which Home Depot will collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage the personal information of our Canadian consumers, as set out below.

#### Shopping at The Home Depot:

When you purchase products and services at one of our Stores, you can do so anonymously when you pay with cash. If you use a credit or debit card for any of your purchases, we will collect your credit or debit card information, your signature and keep a history of your purchases. We use this information to process your orders, to ensure proper delivery, to better assist you when you visit or call us as well as to improve our product and service offerings. 

When you return previously purchased merchandise or request a refund or exchange, you may be asked to give your name, address, phone number and show information that identifies you, such as your driver's licence. We collect this information to process and track returns and to help detect and prevent fraud and otherwise administer our loss prevention program.

#### Installation Services and Tool Rentals:

When you purchase installation services you will be asked for information such as your name, address, email address and phone number. You may also be asked for your credit or debit card details along with a shipping or installation address. This information will help ensure the proper delivery of the services you order from The Home Depot and our Service Providers and to better assist you when you call us. For other services, such as truck rentals or certain equipment rentals, we may request that you present additional personal information and identification, such as a driver's licence and verification of insurance. We use this information to comply with legal requirements, to confirm the identity of our contracting parties, and to assist us in retrieving tools and other equipment not returned by customers.

#### Call Centres:

When you call one of our Call Centres about a product, delivery, an installation, a billing question or for customer service, you may be asked for information that identifies you along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question, such as your name and address and a phone number where we might contact you. We may retain this information to assist you in the future.

#### Online Registration:

Registration is an optional service provided by our Sites. You do not have to register to browse or shop online. When you register, you are asked for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, a password that you select, and optionally, your interests. Your registration information may be used to help make your online shopping quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information. When you register you will have the opportunity to sign up to receive future marketing information from Home Depot.

#### Contests, Questions or Surveys:

When you ask a question, participate in a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes at a Store, a Home Depot sponsored event or through our Sites, we may collect your name, address, phone number and email address. We use this information to administer your participation in a contest or sweepstakes. At the time you are entering a contest or sweepstakes, we may ask your permission to send you future marketing information from The Home Depot.

#### Employment at The Home Depot:

We advertise employment opportunities on our Sites. In connection with a job application or related inquiry, you may provide us with certain personal information about yourself (such as that contained in a resume, cover letter, or similar employment-related materials, or any applicable pre-screening questions). We use the personal information you provide for the purpose of processing and responding to your application.

#### Other Uses of Personal Information:

### Disclosure of Personal Information

#### Personal Information Disclosure:

The Home Depot will not trade, rent or sell your personal information, without your prior consent, except as otherwise set out herein.

#### The Home Depot Financial Products:

The Home Depot uses Service Providers to offer financial products, such as The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card. We may share personal information about Home Depot consumers with these Service Providers in order to provide you with tailored information about products and services and special offers. These Service Providers also have their own privacy statement that sets out the manner in which they will collect, use and disclose personal information. We encourage you to review each Service Provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your application for such services.

#### Extended Warranty Services:

If you purchase a Home Depot Extended Warranty Service you will be required to provide information such as your name and address to our warranty Service Provider. While these Service Providers are limited by contract in the way they may use your information to provide the Home Depot Warranty Services, we encourage you to review the Service Provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your personal information for such services.

#### Companies that Work with or on Behalf of The Home Depot:

Some of our operations, such as our call centres and the employment application section of any of our Sites, may be managed by our Canadian, US and foreign Service Providers. Also, if you purchase installation services from The Home Depot, these services may not be provided by The Home Depot Associates, but rather by reputable local or national Service Providers with which we contract to provide such services. These Service Providers may have access to your personal information on a confidential basis to the extent necessary to perform their functions. In no event will these companies have the right to use your personal information for any reason other than to provide you with those specific services, except as may be permitted by law. Information provided by you will be used by The Home Depot and its Service Providers to learn about the experiences of our customers so that we may enhance our programs and improve our level of service. For further information on the manner in which our service providers process your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer as set out under the "How to Contact Us" section below.

If your purchases are being shipped to you, we will share your shipping information on a confidential basis with our delivery Service Providers (U.S. Postal Service, Canada Post, or other delivery companies we or you select). Our delivery Service Providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than making the delivery.

#### Sale of Business:

The Home Depot reserves the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party acquirer.

#### Legal:

Please note that The Home Depot and our Service Providers must provide your personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required by law. We may also disclose personal information to assist us in collecting a debt owed by you. Your personal information may be maintained and processed on our behalf by Home Depot US and our Service Providers who may be required to disclose information in accordance with applicable US or other foreign laws.

### Access to Personal Information

As a registered user with our Sites, you can access your profile information at any time by clicking on the "Sign In" button at the top of any page on the Sites on which you are registered. 

For further instructions on accessing the personal information that Home Depot may have about you, please see the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy and Security Statement. 

### Additional Information about our Sites

#### Visiting our Sites:

In general, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or providing us with any information. However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites. We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites.

#### Cookies:

Our Sites use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our Service Providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites.

#### Tracer Tags:

Our Sites may also use a technology called "tracer tags". These may also be referred to as "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons". This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Sites. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Sites for you and other future website visitors.

#### Third Party Links:

Our Sites may include links to the websites of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your prior consent. 

The Home Depot provides links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. The inclusion of any link does not imply Home Depot's endorsement of any other company, its websites, or its products and/or services. These linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies, which we recommend you read carefully. We have no control over such websites and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose and otherwise treat your personal information.

### Security of Personal Information

We will maintain the confidentiality of all personal information collected in our Stores, our Call Centres, our Sites and from our Service Providers and will only transfer such information to employees of The Home Depot, The Home Depot US, and our Canadian, US and other foreign Service Providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Privacy and Security Statement. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control. We maintain your personal information for as long as required for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

### Security Measures on our Sites

#### Secure Shopping:

When you place orders on our Sites, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your personal information. 

The Home Depot also takes the following measures to protect your personal information online:

#### Passwords:

To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. The Home Depot will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or email messages).

#### Order Information:

Since any order information you provide to us on our Sites will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Sites. The most recent versions of Netscape NavigatorTM and Microsoft Internet Explorer® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively.

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, The Home Depot cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on our Sites. 

### Who We Are

The Home Depot is comprised of a family of companies and divisions brought together to provide you with a full suite of home or office improvement products and services.
