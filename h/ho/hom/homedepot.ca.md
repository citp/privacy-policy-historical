The Home Depot Inc.  
Privacy & Security Statement for Canada

We know that your privacy is very important to you. That's why protecting any personal information, such as your name, address, email address or phone number that you provide to us is of the utmost importance to The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates, brands and other Home Depot companies (the "Home Depot"). As a result, we have prepared this Privacy and Security Statement to let you know about the manner in which we collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage the personal information you entrust to us at any of our Home Depot store locations (the "Stores"), through any Home Depot Call Centres (the "Call Centres"), through Home Depot websites (the "Sites"), or through our authorized service providers ("Service Providers").

When you provide personal information at our Stores, our Call Centres, our Sites and to our Service Providers, you are consenting to the manner in which Home Depot will collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage your personal information, as set out below.

For purposes of this Privacy Statement, Home Depot U.S., The Home Depot Mexico and Home Decorators Collection are considered separate businesses. The Privacy Statements for these businesses may be viewed at [www.homedepot.com/privacy](http://www.homedepot.com/privacy), [www.homedepot.com.mx/privacy](http://www.homedepot.com.mx/privacy) and [www.homedecorators.com/privacy](http://www.homedecorators.com/privacy). 

We may collect personal information that you provide us when you:

  * Purchase, order, return, exchange or request certain information about our products and services;
  * Request a quote and/or purchase one of our installation services for your home or office;
  * Request warranty or product repair services;
  * Sign up or register for loyalty club membership communications or offerings;

  * Visit or register with our Sites or participate in another feature of our Sites, such as a bulletin board;
  * Enter into a contest or sweepstakes or respond to one of our surveys; or
  * Provide us with comments or suggestions.

We may also collect personal information about you from our Service Providers. 

When you purchase products and services at one of our Stores, you can do so anonymously when you pay with cash. If you use a credit or debit card for any of your purchases, we will collect your credit or debit card information and keep a history of your purchases. We use this information to process your orders, to ensure proper delivery, to better assist you when you visit or call us as well as to improve our product and service offerings. 

When you return previously purchased merchandise or request a refund or exchange, you may be asked to give your name, address, phone number and show information that identifies you, such as your driver's license. We collect this information to help prevent fraud.

When you purchase installation services you will be asked for information such as your name, address, e-mail address and phone number. You may also be asked for your credit or debit card details along with a shipping or installation address. This information will help ensure the proper delivery of the services you order from Home Depot and our Service Providers and to better assist you when you call us. For other services, such as truck rentals or certain equipment rentals, we may request that you present additional personal information and identification, such as a driver's license and verification of insurance. 

When you call one of our Call Centres about a product, delivery, an installation, a billing question or for customer service, you may be asked for information that identifies you along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question, such as your name and address and a phone number where we might contact you. We may retain this information to assist you in the future. 

Registration is an optional service provided by our Sites. You do not have to register to browse or shop online. When you register, you are asked for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, a password that you select, and optionally, your interests. Your registration information may be used to help make your online shopping quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information. When you register you will have the opportunity to sign up for future marketing information from Home Depot. 

When you ask a question, participate in a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes at a Store, a Home Depot sponsored event or through our Sites, we may collect your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We use this information to administer your participation in a contest or sweepstakes. At the time you are entering a contest or sweepstakes, we may ask your permission to send you future marketing information from Home Depot. 

Home Depot uses personal information, including information provided to us from our Service Providers, to continually assess and improve the products and services we offer. We would also like to inform you of products and services, sales and special offers that might benefit you. When you register online or participate in a survey, you will have the opportunity to sign up for e-mails about our products, services, sales and special offers. 

We may also send you mail, email or call you with information about our product and service offerings if you have provided us with your name and address, email address or phone numbers at our Stores, Call Centres or Sites. If you would like to stop receiving such promotional information from Home Depot Canada, please see the Privacy Preferences/Opt-Out section of this Privacy and Security Statement or go to [www.homedepot.ca/privacypreferences](https://web.archive.org/web/20071211081616id_/http%3A//www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PrivacyPreferencesDisplay?storeId=10051&catalogId=10051&langId=-15) for further instructions on how to register your preferences. 

We now offer an on-line privacy preference page at [www.homedepot.ca/privacypreferences](https://web.archive.org/web/20071211081616id_/http%3A//www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PrivacyPreferencesDisplay?storeId=10051&catalogId=10051&langId=-15) where you can register or change your preferences to receive or not receive marketing materials sent by phone, email and mail. You may update these preferences at any time. Please allow sufficient time for your preferences to be processed.

For purposes of this Privacy Statement, The Home Depot U.S., The Home Depot Mexico and Home Decorators Collection are considered separate businesses. If you have provided information directly to either of these businesses and want to register or change your preferences you must do so directly with that business. The Privacy Statements and privacy preference options for these businesses may be viewed at [www.homedepot.com/privacy](http://www.homedepot.com/privacy), [www.homedepot.com.mx/privacy](http://www.homedepot.com.mx/privacy) and [www.homedecorators.com/privacy](http://www.homedecorators.com/privacy). 

Information about others: At our Stores, Call Centres or on some of the pages on our Sites, you can submit information about other people and compose personalized messages to them. For example, you can order Home Depot Gift Cards and merchandise and send them directly to a friend along with a personalized message composed by you. We consider the information you submit and the content of your personalized message to be a private communication between you and the recipient. Home Depot will not use or disclose any information you provide about someone else for any purpose other than: 

  1. To ship the order and confirm delivery; 
  2. To identify or resolve technical problems or customer service issues; 
  3. As required by law and to comply with a court order or other legal process; 
  4. To respond to claims that your personalized messages violate the rights of third parties; and 
  5. To protect the rights or property of Home Depot and its affiliates. 

Your Suggestions: We use your feedback, suggestions, survey information and comments solely to monitor and/or improve the use and features of our Stores, Call Centres, our Sites and our product and service offerings.

More information for parents about our Kids Workshops can be obtained from your local Home Depot Store. We do not offer an online application for our Kids Workshops.

Disclosure of Personal Information

**Personal Information Disclosure: Home Depot will not trade, rent or sell your personal information, without your prior consent, except as otherwise set out herein.**

**Home Depot Financial Products:**

Home Depot uses Service Providers to offer financial products, such as the Home Depot credit card and home improvement loan. We may share personal information about Home Depot consumers with these Service Providers in order to provide you with tailored information about products and services and special offers. These Service Providers also have their own privacy statement that sets out the manner in which they will collect, use and disclose personal information. We encourage you to review each Service Provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your application for such services. 

**Extended Warranty Services:**

If you purchase a Home Depot Extended Warranty Service you will be required to provide information such as your name and address to our warranty Service Provider. While these Service Providers are limited by contract in the way they may use your information to provide the Home Depot Warranty Services, we encourage you to review the Service Provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your personal information for such services. 

**Companies that work with or on behalf of Home Depot:**

Some of our operations, such as our call centres, may be managed by unaffiliated companies. Also, if you purchase installation services from Home Depot, these services may not be provided by Home Depot associates, but rather by reputable local or national companies with which we contract to provide such services. These companies may have access to your personal information on a confidential basis only to the extent necessary to perform their functions. In no event will these companies have the right to use your personal information for any reason other than to provide you with those specific services. Information provided by you will be used by The Home Depot and its Service Providers to learn about the experiences of our customers so that we may enhance our programs and improve our level of service. If your purchases are being shipped to you, we will share your shipping information on a confidential basis with our delivery service providers (U.S. Postal Service, Canada Post, or other delivery companies we or you select). Our delivery service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than making the delivery. 

**Sale of Business:**

Home Depot reserves the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party acquirer. 

**Legal:**

Please note that Home Depot must provide your personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required by law. We may also disclose personal information to assist us in collecting a debt owed by you. 

  
You may request access to the personal information that we have about you. As a registered user with our Sites, you can access your profile information at any time by: 

  1. Clicking on the "Sign In" button at the top of any page on the Sites on which you registered, then 
  2. Clicking on the "Your Account" button on the page header or on the "Your Account" link under Customer Support. 

For further instructions on accessing the personal information that Home Depot may have about you, please see the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy and Security Statement. 

  
In general, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or providing us with any information. However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites. We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites. 

Our Sites use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our service providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites. 

Our Sites may also use a technology called "tracer tags". These may also be referred to as "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons". This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Sites. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Sites for you and other future website visitors.

Our Sites may include links to the websites of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your prior consent. 

Home Depot provides links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. The inclusion of any link does not imply Home Depot's endorsement of any other company, its websites, or its products and/or services. These linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies, which we recommend you read carefully. We have no control over such websites and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose and otherwise treat your personal information. 

  
We will maintain the confidentiality of all personal information collected in our Stores, our Call Centres, our Sites and from our Service Providers and will only disclose such information to employees and Service Providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Privacy and Security Statement. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control.

  
When you place orders on our Sites, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your personal information. 

Home Depot also takes the following measures to protect your personal information online:

To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. Home Depot will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages). 

Since any order information you provide to us on our Sites will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Sites. The most recent versions of Netscape NavigatorTM and Microsoft Internet Explorer® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively.

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, Home Depot cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on our Sites. 

  
Home Depot is comprised of a family of companies and divisions brought together to provide you with a full suite of home or office improvement products and services.
