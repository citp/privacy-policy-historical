### Information We Collect

We may obtain certain personal information (such as name and other contact details) through our Sites. Here are the most common types of information:

  * Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address, telephone number and fax number);
  * login and access credentials (such as username and password);
  * information about your property or mortgage loan;
  * age and gender;
  * real estate license number; and
  * responses to brief online surveys
  * comments you submit through our Sites.



We offer visitors to our Sites various services, which we may change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain personal information so we can provide you with these services.

When you visit our Sites, information may be collected through automated technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons. A "cookie" is a file that Web sites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web beacon," also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. The information collected using these tools may include your IP address, browser characteristics, operating system, the address of the web page that referred you to our Site, dates and times of Site visits, the language your system uses, and the country and time zone in which your device is located. These technologies permit the collection of "clickstream data," which may include a log of content you access while browsing a website.

On some of our Sites, we also use third-party web analytics services, such as Omniture, ForSee and Google Analytics. These services may rely upon technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us analyze how visitors reach and interact with our Sites. The information collected through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.

### Sharing of Information

In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities or regulatory agencies, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us on our Sites in a manner that is consistent with this Online Privacy Notice.

### Your Rights and Choices
