Effective on: August 1, 2006  
Last updated on: November 11, 2008 

Schering-Plough Home Again LLC ("Home Again") is committed to protecting your privacy.   Home Again offers a pet recovery service for pet safety and health, education for pet owners, and products, information and special offers from us and our carefully selected business partners that we believe you will value (the "HomeAgain® Program"). 

We will not sell or rent your information. We will share it with third parties for purposes related to the HomeAgain® Program and these third parties will only be able to use the information for marketing purposes related to pet products, safety and health. Please read this Privacy Notice to understand the ways in which we collect, use, and disclose information we receive from or about you through the HomeAgain® Program. 

**_Collection of Personal Information_** **.**   You may access and browse our Web site without disclosing any information that identifies you, such as name, address, or e-mail address ("Personal Information").  We will collect Personal Information from or about you in the following instances:

  * _Information you provide_.  We will collect and store any Personal Information you enter on our Web site or provide to us in some other manner.  For example: 

    * When you enroll in the HomeAgain® Program, we will collect your first and last names, postal and e-mail addresses, telephone number(s), and other information, including payment information (such as credit card number) and pet information, that will allow us to secure your membership in the HomeAgain® Program. 

    * If you request information, products or services from Home Again, or ask us to resolve questions or concerns, we will ask you to provide information such as your name, contact information, and other identifying information necessary to respond to a particular inquiry. 

    * If you respond to surveys, assessment tools, questionnaires, and other forms of feedback requests, we will collect information from you that you provide in such settings. 

  * _Information from outside sources_.  Other entities will collect Personal Information from or about you and provide it to Home Again if you choose to enroll in the HomeAgain® Program.  For example, you will be able to enroll in the HomeAgain® Program through veterinary clinics, animal shelters, pet stores, retailers, and other entities, which will share your enrollment information with us.  We also will obtain information about you from other sources, including commercially available sources (for example, national change of address information). 

  * _Information about others_.  We also will collect and store Personal Information about other people that you provide to us.  For example, if you list someone other than yourself as a point of contact, we will collect and store that information.  We also will collect information about your pet, such as name, microchip number and breed.

We also also will use standard Internet technology, such as Internet tags (also known as Web beacons, action tags, or GIFs) in combination with cookies at our Web site and will deploy these tags through an advertising company. These tags are placed on both online advertisements that bring users to our Web site and on different pages within our Web site. We use this technology to measure visitors' responses to our Web site and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns (including how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted). Please be assured that we do not collect or seek through these tags or cookies any Personal Information about our visitors.

In addition, we will share your Personal Information with carefully selected business partners so we may communicate with you about special offers related to the HomeAgain® Program that we hope will be of interest to you.  These business partners will only be authorized to use your Personal Information for marketing purposes related to pet products, safety and health.  We also will disclose your information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.  Also, we will disclose your information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

**_Your Choices_** **.**  You have a choice about the receipt of special e-mail offers.  If you enroll in the HomeAgain® Program through our Web site, you will be presented at that time with the option not to receive promotional emails.  If you enroll in the HomeAgain® Program through other means (such as through your veterinary clinic), you may visit our website and create an online account where you will be presented with the same options.  In either case, you can modify your promotional email preference at any time by visiting our Web site, calling 1-888-HOMEAGAIN (1-888-466-3242), or by sending an email to _customerservice@homeagain.com._  We also will provide instructions on how to unsubscribe from special e-mail offers within any such e-mail we send to you.
