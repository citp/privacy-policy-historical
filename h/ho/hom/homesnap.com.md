Users may view active listings on our site and review the entire site’s content without providing any personal information. If a user wishes to set up email alerts or view sold and “under contract” listings, registration is required. Registration consists of providing an email address and creating a password, which information is kept private consistent with this policy.

Our web server automatically recognizes only the user’s domain name, unless the user has previously chosen to register, in which case it will also recognize the user’s email address. In order to improve our services and enhance the user’s experience on our site, we collect information about what pages consumers access or visit.

We use “cookies” in a manner similar to most other Web sites. A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual and to remember information about your preferences, which can enhance and improve your user experience. For this reason, most web browsers automatically accept cookies, however you typically may modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.

Various brokers/agents, lenders and escrow/settlement companies to whom we may refer you each may have their own privacy policies governing how they handle any of your personally identifiable information. Homesnap accepts no responsibility or liability for third party privacy policies or the actions of any third party with respect to your personally identifiable information.
