| The Home Decorating Company understands your concerns about online security and the security and privacy of your personal information. Because we share your concerns, we have built a highly secure ordering environment – so you can shop with confidence.  
  
**Safe, 100% Secure Online Ordering**

The Home Decorating Company's web site uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology, the industry standard, which encrypts sensitive information including your name and address, email address and highly confidential information, such as a credit card number.  When you are using a security-enabled browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, the information you send us while on a secure page is encrypted. You will always encounter a "secure page" when you enter the checkout process. Encryption safeguards the information so it cannot be read by unauthorized parties. 

When you are on a secure page during the checkout process, here is how you will know: Your browser's location address will begin with **https://**. In addition you will see a lock icon at the bottom of your browser window that may look something like this:  (This varies according to the type of browser you have.)

Product description pages and other store information pages may not have the lock or https://. This is normal. The only pages used to transmit personal details (billing address, email address, and credit card information) are in the account area and checkout, and those pages will always be secure. 

But that's not all we do to ensure you we use COMODO software and digital certificates which allows your computer to confirm that it is communicating with The Home Decorating Company website (www.home-decorating-co.com). You can click on the COMODO logo at right to verify that www.home-decorating-co.com is a secure site. For your security, the verification process happens in the background every time you place an order on our site. |

**Privacy Policy - We Keep Your Information Private, Period**

Our privacy policy is short, because we keep your private information private, period. We value you as a customer, and know that protecting your privacy is important. Your personal details and email address will not be shared, rented, or sold to 3rd parties -- ever.
