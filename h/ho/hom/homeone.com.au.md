#### With whom do we disclose your personal information?

Not linked to personally identifiable information, an aggregate of IP addresses are used to analyze user visitation trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Information that is not personally identifiable may be shared with site visitors, clients, content providers, advertisers, and affiliates. For example, we may share the total value of the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, any advertising over a given period.

We forward your Get Quote, Ask a Question or Contact us form to Advertisers you intend to communicate with. In that circumstance, We forward Your personal information voluntarily submitted in the form by you to those Advertisers in order to meet Your request for goods or services. 

Our forum support members and Admin can view Member IP's and email addresses for the primary purpose of preventing and managing forum abuse and breaches of the Forum Terms of Use.

Payment information inputted at our Site is collected and processed by a contracted third-party merchant gateway, Payway, and stored on their server/s. See [PayWay](https://www.payway.com.au/) website to read their Privacy Policy.

Unless otherwise authorised to do so with Your consent, homeone® does not sell, share, or rent personally identifiable information to third parties other than those contracted by homeone®.

Other than the above, personal information may be disclosed in special situations where homeone® has reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with Our rights or property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, homeone® may disclose personal information when We believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure. 

**Change of ownership**  
In the event homeone.com.au were to merge or be acquired by another company, the new entity would comply with this Privacy Policy. Should this Privacy Policy be amended as a result of new ownership whereby your personal information will be handled differently, you will receive notification of any changes to a forthcoming Privacy Policy.

#### How do we protect your personal information?

We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to homeone® sites, and We review and update Our security measures in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.

We will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information You may transmit to Us or from Our online products and services. Once We do receive Your transmission, homeone® will also make Our best efforts to ensure its security on Our systems.

In addition, homeone® employees and the contractors who provide services related to Our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. However, We will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to Your personal information.

All forms associated with any purchase from homeone® pass Your financial details through a secure server using the latest 128-bit SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption technology. If You have an questions regarding Our security policy, please contact Us on 1300 HOME1.

Users may be able to draw connections to personally identify you in association with your Member account should you include enough personal information in the content you post publicly, such as street name, photos of your home, or even based on similar usernames and / or avatars (aka Profile Photos) utilised on other third-party sites that potentially reveals more personal information about you. 

In support of your privacy, We allow pseudonyms as usernames, and in fact, encourage use of never-used-before pseudonyms and avatars.

Private messages you send or receive using our Service remain private to the degree that both sender and receiver commits to keeping the messages private. For example, if you send a message to another Member, that Member in question may choose to publicly post your private message.

Again, in support of your privacy, we strongly advise you avoid disclosing personally identifiable information in private messages.
