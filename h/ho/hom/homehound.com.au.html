<h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
<p>This statement has been produced with reference to the guidelines set out by the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner, Australia. For more information visit: <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au">www.privacy.gov.au </a>. </p>
<p>homehound.com.au is committed to providing its customers and clients with the highest possible standards of product and service. As part of that commitment we have produced the following Privacy Policy statement to help you better understand the privacy issues that arise as a result of the use of our website products and services. </p>
<p>This policy statement will address the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The types of information we collect </li>
  <li>How we use or disclose the information we collect </li>
  <li>The quality and security of the information we hold </li>
  <li>Your access to the information we hold </li>
  <li>Transborder (interstate and international) data movement </li>
  <li>Your participation on our website </li>
  <li>Links to other websites </li>
  <li>Our policy on children's privacy protection </li>
  <li>How to contact us for more information </li>
</ul>
<h2>The types of information we collect </h2>
<p>In general, when you visit homehound.com.au you do not have to tell us who you are, or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. Unless you specifically agree to tell us, we will never know who you are, and you are able to interact with homehound.com.au in a relatively anonymous way. </p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is defined as any specific data that could disclose you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number, billing and shipping information, credit card information or e-mail address. </p>
<p>When you visit homehound.com.au our servers automatically record basic information about your usage, such as the type of internet browser and operating system you are using, the date, time and duration of your visit and the pages you viewed. This information is anonymous and does not identify you as an individual, nor will we combine it with information that does identify you as an individual. This information is collected and analysed to provide us with a greater understanding of how you use homehound.com.au. </p>
<p>Where necessary we collect personally identifiable information on certain areas of homehound.com.au, for example, if you enter a competition or subscribe to an e-mail newsletter. The personally identifiable information collected may consist of a username or unique user ID and contact information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone and fax numbers. You may have the opportunity to make purchases on homehound.com.au, in which case we would need to collect your order information, credit card details and delivery instructions in order to facilitate payment and shipment. </p>
<p>From time to time we may invite you to answer survey questions and provide certain demographic information, such as your age, sex, income bracket, country of access, and location of connection, (e.g. home or work). Your response to these types of surveys is entirely voluntary and you should feel no obligation to participate. </p>
<p>At times we may use a feature of your browser (called a "cookie") to automatically assign you a unique user ID or a session ID. A cookie, by itself, cannot be used to find out your identity, it merely identifies your computer to our servers when you visit homehound.com.au. We will not combine your user ID or session ID with information that does identify you as an individual. You may, at anytime, set your browser to allow, notify you or refuse altogether the use of cookies. </p>
<h2>How we use or disclose the information we collect </h2>
<p>In general, the information we collect is used for our own analysis aimed at improving our products and services. We may use personally identifiable information to perform other functions including, demographic analysis of site usage (who is visiting homehound.com.au and what they are interested in), customising advertising and content seen by our users, and improving our marketing and promotional efforts. </p>
<p>We will not intentionally disclose any personally identifiable information and we do not sell, trade or rent such information to third parties (such as advertisers or telemarketers). </p>
<p>Any personally identifiable information you provide will only be provided to third parties if: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You consent to such a disclosure </li>
  <li>We are compelled or authorised to do so by law </li>
  <li>We reasonably believe there is a threat to someone's life or health </li>
  <li>Our website or business is sold to, or merged with another entity </li>
</ul>
<h2>The quality and security of the information we hold </h2>
<p>Any information you provide to us is stored and held under generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Only authorised personnel are provided access to personally identifiable information and these personnel are required to treat this information as confidential. Despite these precautions, we cannot guarantee absolutely that any and all unauthorised access to your personally identifiable information will be prevented. </p>
<h2>Your access to the information we hold </h2>
<p>If you would like to access, correct, update or deactivate any information you have submitted, please send a request to <a href="mailto:info@homehound.com.au">info@homehound.com.au </a>. We will modify or deactivate any information that could be used to identify you as soon as practicable after your request, unless we are required or authorised by law not to do so. Once deactivated your data will not be accessible, however, due to system backups to various types of data storage media, your data may in some circumstances remain on these types of data storage media. </p>
