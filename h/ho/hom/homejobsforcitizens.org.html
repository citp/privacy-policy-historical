      <p><strong>What  information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?</strong> <br>

When a visitor requests a  page from any Web site within the <strong>Home Jobs For Citizens </strong>Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's  domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing  personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our  site.

To make such a request, please send an  e-mail to our customer privacy care center at <a href="mailto:support@GettingAmericaBackToWork.org">support@HomeJobsForCitizens.org</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Data  Security</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Home Jobs For Citizens </strong>is committed to  doing its best to maintain the security of information collected on our site. </p>
      <p>        While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we  have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to put in  place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to  safeguard and secure the information we collect.&nbsp; When you place orders  for purchased products or access your payment information, we use industry  standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology to protect the storage  and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties. Encryption is a process by  which a message or information is scrambled while it is in transit to our  website SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server,  rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. In  addition to our online security efforts, we take steps to protect your personal  data offline, as well. All sensitive information and/or systems that house that  information (i.e., computers or filing cabinet) have physically restricted  access in our offices. Employees are granted access on a need-to-know basis  pursuant to specific job function requirements (for example, a billing clerk or  a customer service representative). Furthermore, ALL employees are kept  up-to-date on our security and privacy practices through periodic training  sessions in an effort to keep security awareness levels high.</p>
      <p><strong>Changes  to the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Home Jobs For Citizens </strong>will  occasionally update this Privacy Policy in response to changing business  circumstances and legal developments. If there are material changes to this  Policy or in how <strong>Home Jobs For Citizens </strong>uses  your personally identifiable information, <strong>Home Jobs For Citizens </strong>will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the  change. <strong>Home Jobs For Citizens </strong>encourages  you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are protecting  your information. &nbsp;&nbsp;This Policy is current as of April 10, 2007. </p>
      <p><strong>Information  About Children</strong></p>
      <p>        We are committed to protecting the privacy and rights of children online. We  believe that children should be able to use the Internet in a safe, productive,  and efficient manner and should be afforded the highest protection available with  respect to their personal information. The Children's Online Privacy Protection  Act ("COPPA") took effect on April 21, 2000 and imposes certain  requirements on Web sites directed toward children under 13 that collect  information on those children, or on Web sites that know they are collecting  information on children under the age of 13. It currently is <strong>Home Jobs For Citizens’</strong> policy not to  collect personal information on any person under 13. To learn more about COPPA,  consult the Federal Trade Commission’s COPPA Web Site <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">www.ftc.gov</a> or you may call 202/FTC-HELP.</p>
