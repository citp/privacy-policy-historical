                    you about our policies with respect to the collection of information 
                    from you and how it is used at Homesite. The information you 
                    provide us is primarily used to enhance your relationship 
                    with us and to better serve the collective needs of our visitors 
                    and customers. We also recognize that this information belongs

                    applies to www.homesite.com and all other sites on the World 
                    Wide Web owned and operated by Homesite Group Inc.</font></p>

                    of Personal and Non-personal Information</b><br>
                    At Homesite, we collect two kinds of information about our 
                    on-line visitors: personal and non-personal. Visitors are 
                    not required to register to access the public pages of Homesite's 
                    sites; however, non-personal information is collected to track 
                    the total number of guests visiting Homesite sites and the 
                    portions of the site most commonly visited. This information 
                    helps guide our efforts to improve our site. The non-personal 
                    visitor information we monitor includes the browser type and 
                    operating system being used; areas of our sites visited; date 
                    and time of access; host or service-provider information, 
                    and identification of the referring site. This information 
                    is used for our internal purposes and is not disclosed to 
                    any non-affiliated third parties.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                    Personal information that can identify a visitor, such as 
                    name, address or information about your home, is collected 
                    only when voluntarily offered and solely for purposes that 
                    are clearly identified on our site. Personal information acquired 
                    through registration or requests for quotes is kept confidential, 
                    but we may share the personal information you provide us with 
                    third parties, as permitted by law, in connection with applications, 
                    claims, or other routine transactions relating to your insurance 
                    with Homesite.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                    you request a quote or apply for a policy, Homesite may also 
                    collect personal information from sources other than you or 
                    someone else named in your application. We may disclose this 
                    information, or information that we collect later in connection 
                    with your Homesite insurance policy, to third parties without 
                    your authorization in certain circumstances, as permitted 
                    by law. You have a right to request access to the information 
                    in our files, and a right to request that we correct, amend, 
                    or delete personal information in our records. Further details

                  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Security</b><br>
                    The importance of security for all personally identifiable 
                    information associated with our guests is of utmost concern 
                    to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet 
                    can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we 
                    strive to protect your personal information, Homesite cannot 
                    ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit 
                    to us or from our online applications, products or services, 
                    and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, 
                    we make our best effort to ensure its security on our internal 
                    systems.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Use 
                    of Cookies</b><br>
                    Homesite may place an electronic "cookie" in the browser files 
                    of a guest's computer. Cookies are pieces of information that 
                    a web site transfers to your browser, which can then be stored 
                    on an individual's computer hard drive for record-keeping 
                    purposes or to provide you with tailored information. Cookies 
                    themselves do not enable us to access any personal information 
                    about our visitors; however, they do allow Homesite to analyze 
                    guests' use of our sites. This analysis helps us better understand 
                    which areas of our site are most useful and popular so we 
                    can plan improvements and updates accordingly. Homesite does 
                    not use cookies to retrieve information from a visitor's computer 
                    that was not originally sent in a cookie. Homesite will never 
                    save passwords, credit card or other sensitive information 
                    in cookies. You may set your browser to notify you when you 
                    receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether 
                    or not to accept it. For more information on cookies and their 
                    use, please refer to the Help facility within your browser. 
                    Use of IP Addresses An IP address is a number that's automatically 
                    assigned to your computer whenever you are connected to the 
                    Internet and surfing the Web. Web pages automatically identify 
                    your computer by its IP address. Homesite collects IP addresses 
                    for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate 
                    information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our 
                    site. When guests request pages from Homesite, our servers 
                    log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses 
                    to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's 
                    session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to 
                    us. We will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel 
                    it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules 
                    or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers 
                    or others.</font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>
			Business Transfers</b><br>
			As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. 
			In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred 
                  business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Homesite, or substantially 
                  all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the
                  transferred assets. </font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Children's 
                    Guidelines</b><br>
                    Homesite encourages parents and guardians to spend time online 
                    with their children. No information should be submitted to 
                    Homesite by guests under 18 (eighteen) years of age without 
                    the consent of their parent or guardian. Whenever possible, 
                    Homesite will not collect online contact information or personally 
                    identifiable offline contact information of individuals under 
                    18 (eighteen) years of age without prior parental consent. 
                    Homesite will not give the ability to publicly post or otherwise 
                    distribute personally identifiable contact information of

                    sites, you might be directed to other sites that we do not
