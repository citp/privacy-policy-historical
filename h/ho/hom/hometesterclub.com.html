  <p><strong>TERMS OF USE</strong><br>
    Your use of this Site is also subject to the   Terms of Use posted on this Site ("Terms of Use").</p>
  <p><strong>COLLECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
    We collect   personal information about you (i.e. information which may identify you in some   way, such as your name, address, age other contact details such as telephone   number, email address etc. and passwords) through this website only when you   voluntarily submit it. This may be when you register on the website, request   information, submit comments or participate in some game, promotion, survey or   other feature of the website. Providing personal information is up to you. If   you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it. If   you choose not to give personal information to us, we may not be able to provide   you with access to some or all of the pages on this Site or our other products   and services. Occasionally, we may ask you for personal information about other   people - for example, your family or other authorized representatives. If you   give us this information, we rely on you to tell those people that you are   giving their personal information to us and to make them aware of this Privacy   Policy.</p>
  <p><strong>USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
    We may use your personal   information as follows:<br>
    To respond to your questions and requests, to provide   you with access to certain areas, features, promotions and games and to   communicate with you about your activities on this website.</p>
  <p>To share it with our Related Parties as required to perform functions on our   behalf in connection with the Site (such as delivery of merchandise,   administration of the website or promotions or other features on it, marketing,   data analysis or customer services). To do so, it may be necessary for us to   transmit your personal information to outside the above Jurisdiction and you   agree to this transfer. Further use or disclosure of the information by them for   other purposes is not permitted. <br>
    To provide you with product information or   promotional and other offers from us or our Related Parties*.</p>
  <p>* However, at the point of collection of your information we will provide you   either an "opt in" or "opt-out" mechanism depending on the requirements of the   Site's Jurisdiction and the Site. An "opt-in" mechanism will provide you the   opportunity to positively indicate that you would like or do not object to our   sending you such further communications and we will not send you any unless you   have "opted-in". An "opt-out" mechanism will provide you the opportunity to   indicate that you do not want us to send you such further communications, and if   you "opt-out" we will not send you any.</p>
  <p>* Either way, opting-in or opting-out will be up to you and, in addition, if   you do not want us to use your personal information for a particular purpose or   disclose it to a third party, you may "opt out" at any time by contacting us as   provided above.<br>
    * Specific opt-outs may also be provided at the point of   collection or along with the communications to you.</p>
  <p>* Please note though, by opting-out, you may not be able to participate in   certain activities on the Site.</p>
  <p>For other purposes set out when your information is collected or in any   additional terms and conditions applicable to the particular feature of the Site <br>
    For disclosures required by law, regulation or court order.</p>
  <p>For the purpose of or in connection with legal proceedings or necessary for   establishing, defending or exercising legal rights.</p>
  <p>In an emergency to protect the health or safety of Site users or the general   public or in the interests of national security.</p>
  <p>Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal   information to any third parties without your specific consent.</p>
  <p><strong>CHECKING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
    If you wish to verify,   correct, access or update any of your personal information collected through   this Site, contact us at the above "Contact" address, telephone number or   e-mail.</p>

Without such consent, though, the child may not   be able to participate in certain activities.
