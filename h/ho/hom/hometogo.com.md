We do so in order to provide you with information about products from our offerings that may interest you based on your recent searches.

If you do not want to receive product recommendations from us, you can let us know at any time. You can find our contact details under section 2. Naturally, you will also find an unsubscribe link in every email.

3.5.3. Interest-based advertising

In order for you to receive information that is likely to be of interest to you, we categorize your user profile. To do so, we use information about your searches to customize the newsletter articles and promotional emails we send you. The goal is to send you advertising that is oriented towards your actual needs and to avoid sending unnecessary advertising.

The legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Processing existing customer data this way for advertising purposes is deemed to be a legitimate interest.

3.5.4 Push notifications

In our application we offer the possibility to activate push notifications which include short information on relevant topics and news about our services and may be displayed even if you are not using the application. If you allow or activate push notifications, a token will be assigned to your device. The token is an encrypted identifier and is used for the technical implementation of push notifications. We use the services of Accengage S.A., 31 rue du 4 Septembre, 75 002 Paris, France, to send and control push notifications. Data is collected and transmitted (push ID, IP address, access times, advertising identifier if applicable, location data if applicable). In addition, data about the use of the push notifications (such as opening rate or display duration) is collected and stored for improvement and customization of our services. Accengage will only receive the relevant data with your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. You can activate or deactivate push notifications at any time in the settings of your device. Further details and information can be found in the Accengage Privacy Policy at <https://www.accengage.com/privacy-policy/>.

The legal basis for the processing of your data in the context of push notifications is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR, for the analysis for customized services it is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Your data will only be stored for the duration of the use of the push notification services.

To do so, you need only send an email to_[ _info@hometogo.com_](mailto:info@hometogo.com) _or send a letter to the HomeToGo address mentioned in section 2 above._

In the event that you object, the relevant contact address will be blocked for further promotional processing. We point out that, in exceptional cases, advertising material may temporarily continue to be sent to you even after your objection has been received. This is due to technical reasons related to the lead time required for advertisements and does not mean that your objection will not be observed by us. Thank you for your understanding.

3.6. Cookies – general information 

We use cookies on our website on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our interest in optimizing our website is deemed to be legitimate within the meaning of the aforementioned provision.

Cookies are small files that your browser automatically creates and that are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our website or use our app. Cookies do not harm your device, do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malicious software. The information stored in the cookie is tied to the specific device used. However, this does not mean that we are immediately aware of your identity. In part, cookies are used to make the use of our service more pleasant for you. For example, we use what are known as session cookies to detect that you have already visited individual pages on our website or that you have already logged in to your user account. These are automatically deleted after you leave our website. In addition, to ensure user-friendliness we also use temporary cookies, which are stored on your device for a specific period of time. If you visit our website again to use our services, it is automatically detected that you have already visited us, as well as what information you entered and the settings you used, so that you do not have to reenter them.

If you already have an account and are logged in or activate the "Stay logged in" feature, the information stored in cookies will be added to your user account.

On the other hand, we use cookies to statistically record the use of our website, to optimize our services, and to display information tailored to your specific needs. These cookies enable us to automatically detect that you have previously visited us when you return to our website. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined period of time. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or to make sure that a message always appears before a new cookie is created. However, disabling cookies completely may mean that you will not be able to use all the features of our website. The storage period of cookies depends on their purpose and therefore varies.

3.7. Analytical tools

In order to customize and continuously optimize our websites in line with users’ needs, we deploy tools on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR which permit us to analyze the use of our website.

3.7.1. Google Analytics

is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. Google complies with the Privacy Policy of the US Privacy Shield and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's US Privacy Shield Program. In addition, we have entered into a data processing agreement for the use of Google Analytics. Under this agreement, Google assures that Google processes data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and ensures the protection of the data subject's rights.

The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on the activity on the website, and to provide other services related to the use of the website and internet usage for the purposes of market research and to customize the design of these websites in line with the needs of users. This information may also be transferred to third parties if required by law or if third parties are contracted to process this data. Under no circumstances will your IP address be combined with any other data from Google. The IP addresses are anonymized, which means that it is not possible to identify specific individuals (“IP masking”).

3.7.2. New Relic

To perform accessibility and performance monitoring for our servers, we use the "New Relic" web analytics service provided by New Relic Inc., 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA.

3.7.4. Adjust

In our app, we use the analytics service of Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37A, 10405 Berlin, Germany. The analytics service is implemented in our app via a development environment (SDK - Software Developer Kit). The information generated by the development environment, e.g.

  * hashed (anonymized) IP address

You can object to tracking by Adjust at any time within the "Opt-out" section of Adjust's Privacy Policy. To do this, you must select the device for which you do not want Adjust to perform tracking and specify your Device Identifier. Behavior tracking from apps that use Adjust will then be immediately removed on your device.

3.7.5. Videobeat

We use the Videobeat analytics software by Videobeat Networks GmbH, Rathausstr. 4, 20095 Hamburg, Germany, for the analysis of television and online marketing activities. Traffic on our website is monitored via a tracking pixel.

Pixels, also known as tracking pixels, are small 1x1-pixel GIF files that can be hidden e.g. in graphics or in e-mails when visiting a website. Pixels do not damage your device and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malware.

Through the pixel, IP addresses already collected anonymously are stored together with other data (e.g., operating system or device) in a database. Neither we, nor Videobeat can use that data to identify a concrete person . The information in the database is for the purpose of analysis and evaluation for the production of media plans.

Videobeat’s Privacy Policy can be found here: <https://www.videobeat.net/us/data-privacy-policy/>. You can object to the collection of your data by Videobeat at any time by clicking here: [https://pa.videobeat.net/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en](https://pa.videobeat.net/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en).

3.7.6. Matomo

Additionally, we use the Matomo (formerly Piwik) open source web analytics service provided by InnoCraft Ltd., 150 Willis St, 6011 Wellington, New Zealand (“Matomo”). For this, cookies are used to enable analysis the use of our website. From this data, pseudonymized user profiles can be created and analyzed. The information generated by the cookie, such as your browser and pseudonymized IP address, is processed on our servers. The information generated by the cookie in the pseudonymous user profile is not used to personally identify you and is not combined with your personal data.

More information on data protection when using Matomo can be found here: <https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/>. There you can object to website tracking via “Opt-out“.

3.8. Targeting

The targeting measures listed below and used by us are implemented on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Targeting is used to perform targeted advertising. Through the targeting measures we use, we want to make sure that advertisements which are geared to your interests are displayed on your devices.

3.8.1. Double Click

On our website, information used for the optimization of advertisements is collected and evaluated using cookies (see section 3.6.). To do this, we use Google's targeting technologies (Double Click). These technologies enable us to provide you with customized, interest-based advertising. The cookies used provide e.g. information regarding which of our products you are interested in. Based on this information, we can also display services on third-party websites that are specifically oriented towards your interests you have shown through your previous user behavior. The collection and evaluation of your user behavior takes place exclusively in pseudonymized manner and does not enable us to identify you. In particular, the information is not combined with personally identifiable information about you.

The cookie is automatically deleted after 30 days.

You can also set preferences for the display of interest-based advertising through the Google Ads Settings Manager (<https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl>).

For more information and the privacy policy regarding advertising and Google, please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (<https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl>).

3.8.2. Google AdWords

HomeToGo uses Google's AdWords service, which uses conversion tracking to measure the effectiveness of individual ads, offers and features. For this, a cookie is set as soon as you click on a Google ad. This cookie does not personally identify you, but rather makes it possible to determine whether you return to the page with the specific offer during the 30-day period in which the cookie is valid.

Each AdWords advertiser receives a different cookie. As a result, cookies cannot be tracked via the website of AdWords advertisers. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. We track the total number of users who have clicked on an ad and were redirected to the website with a conversion-tracking tag.

You can permanently prevent the storage of the Google conversion cookie by setting your browser software accordingly. Google's privacy policy on conversion tracking can be found here: <https://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html>.

3.8.3. Google Dynamic Remarketing

We use the features of Google Dynamic Remarketing with the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick.

This feature allows us to link the advertising audiences created with Google Dynamic Remarketing to the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been customized for you based on your past usage and browsing behavior on a device (e.g., smartphone) may also be displayed on another device you use (e.g., tablet or PC).

If you have given the appropriate consent to Google, Google will link your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, the same personalized advertising messages can appear on any device you use to sign in to your Google Account.

To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users who are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.

You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account. To do so, follow this link: <https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl>.

For more information, as well as the provisions regarding data privacy, please see the Google Privacy Policy at <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl>.

3.8.4. Google AdSense

On our website, we use Google AdSense for displaying advertisements. In this way we can show you advertisements that may be of interest to you. These advertisements can be recognized by the reference "Google Ads". To do this, Google uses web beacons and cookies (see section 3.6.). The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the use of the website (including your IP address) and delivery of advertising formats is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. Google may share this information with third parties.

We have enabled third-party Google AdSense ads. The data may be transferred to third parties (named at <https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/94149>).

You can prevent Google AdSense from installing cookies by disabling interest-based ads on Google via the link <https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl>.

For more information, as well as the provisions regarding data privacy, please see the Google Privacy Policy at <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl>.

3.8.5. Google AdMob

We use Google AdMob to display ads in the HomeToGo app. Google uses the Apple "Advertising Identifier" (hereafter “Apple Ad-ID”) for advertising control in the app. A pseudonymized user profile is created under the Apple Ad-ID so that the user can be matched to different advertising segments on the Apple advertising platform in order to be able to display interest-based advertising.

The Apple Ad-ID is a pseudonym that prevents personal plain data from being disclosed to Google. The Apple Ad-ID is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there.

You can prevent the use of the Apple Ad-ID by clicking on "No Ad-Tracking" under "Privacy/Advertising" in your system settings. Alternatively, you can also click “Reset Ad ID” to generate a new, randomly chosen Apple Ad ID and thus prevent a profile from being generated.

3.8.6. Criteo

Pixel technologies (see section 3.7.5.) from Criteo SA, 32 Rue Blanche, 75009 Paris, France ("Criteo") collect and store data for marketing and optimization purposes. Together with Criteo, we determine the purposes and means of processing and are therefore jointly responsible for processing.

The pixels send your IP address, the Referrer URL of the visited website, the time when the pixel was viewed, the browser used and previously set cookie information to a web server. This data can be used to create usage profiles under a pseudonym.

Criteo's pixel technologies allow us to evaluate our advertising campaigns and advertising content. Using an algorithm, Criteo analyzes surfing behavior and can then display targeted product recommendations as personalized advertising banners on other websites (“publishers”). You can find more information about Criteo’s technology in Criteo’s Privacy Policy (<https://www.criteo.com/privacy/>).

Using Criteo will load additional pixels from contractual partners with whom Criteo works. An overview of all publishers and networks that load pixels can be found at <https://www.criteo.com/privacy/criteo-works-with-the-following-platforms/>. The data collected with Criteo technology will not be used to determine the personal identity of the website visitor unless agreed to separately by the data subject. Any use of data other than that described above or transfer to third parties is excluded.

Most browsers accept pixels automatically. You can use the appropriate tools or browser add-ons to prevent the use of pixels on our website (for example, by using the "AdBlock" add-on for the Firefox browser).

You can also object to the pseudonymous analysis of your surfing behavior by us at any time. For instructions on disabling Criteo's service, please visit the following Criteo link: <https://www.criteo.com/privacy/>.

Please note that if you opt out of displaying personalized ads from Criteo and other affiliates, you will still receive advertisements, however these will be less tailored to your interests/browsing habits.

3.8.7. Bing Ads

We use Bing Universal Event Tracking (UET) from Microsoft Bing Ads. This is a service of Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, USA ("Microsoft"). This allows us to track user activity on our website when users reach our website through advertisements from Bing Ads.

If you reach our website via a Bing Ads advertisement, a cookie will be placed on your computer (see section 3.6.). A Bing UET tag is integrated into our website.

3.8.8. Outbrain

On our website, we use technology from the service provider Outbrain Inc., 39 West 13th Street, New York, NY 10011, USA (Outbrain, Outbrain Widgets, Outbrain Pixel). This technology enables us to use pixels (see section 3.7.5.) and cookies (see section 3.6.) to offer further content that may also be of interest to you within our website or on third-party websites ("retargeting"). The recommendations integrated by Outbrain are determined on the basis of your previously read content. The content is technically controlled and delivered by Outbrain automatically.

3.8.9. Taboola

Our website uses technologies from Taboola Inc., 28 West 23rd St., New York, NY 10010, USA ("Taboola"). Taboola uses cookies (see section 3.6.) that determine which content you use and which of our pages you visit (conversion tracking). The cookie enables us to create pseudonymous usage profiles by collecting device-related data as well as log data, and enables us to recommend content that matches your personal interests.

If you belong to the target group, we will show you relevant ads on Facebook. You will not be personally identified by us or by Facebook as part of this process.

You may object to the use of the Custom Audiences service on the Facebook website (<https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences>). After logging in to your Facebook account, you will be taken to the settings for Facebook ads.
