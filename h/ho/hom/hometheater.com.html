	<p><i><b>Personal Information.</b></i>  We collect personally identifiable information, such as names, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, demographic information, and similar information in a variety of situations, including but not limited to the following: (i) when you subscribe to one of our magazines or place an order (see the section below for more information on subscriptions and orders); (ii) when you register at one of our web sites in connection with the purchase of a product, publication, or service; (iii) when you enter personal information on one of our web sites as a condition of participating in contests, promotions, or sweepstakes offered via these web sites; or (iv) when you wish to have a product or service fulfilled by a fulfillment partner who can meet the continuing needs of our customers.    
	</p><p>Some of our sites may collect credit card and related financial information if you wish to purchase a product or subscribe to any publication or service offered via these sites.  If you wish to subscribe to one of our publications or place an order for products or services online, you must generally establish a credit card account with us or our vendors.  Some of our sites also may collect social security numbers from consumers if such consumers use one of our automotive-related web sites and wish to receive a quote from an automotive lender that is part of the site's automotive lender network.  In such instances, we collect social security numbers only to fulfill consumers' requests to receive quotes or other financial offers from a lender in the site's automotive lender network.
	</p><p><i><b>Information Collected Automatically.</b></i>  Our web sites automatically collect certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring website address.  This helps facilitate your online experience at our web sites.  See Sections IV and V of this Privacy Policy for more detail on cookies, web beacons, and other information collected automatically by our web sites.

    <td align="left" valign="top"><b>HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">
	<p>We share your personal information only as described below.
	</p><p><i><b>Sharing Within the Source Corporate Family.</b></i>  
	We may share your personal information with any parent company, subsidiary, or affiliate in the Source corporate family.  All entities within the Source corporate family may have access to your personal information as well as anonymous, aggregate demographic data.
	</p><p><i><b>Source's Service Providers.</b></i>  
	Source may decide to share your personal information with companies that work on behalf of or with Source.  These companies may use your personal information to inform you about Source's products and services, to provide you with information about other exciting products and services, or otherwise to assist Source in serving its customers, understanding its consumer market, or devising effective marketing strategies to reach more consumers.  
	</p><p><i><b>Lead Purchasers.</b></i>  
	Source may decide to share your personal information with third parties who purchase leads from Source, such as automotive dealers and banks.  Some of our web sites require users to disclose personal information as a condition of receiving quotes or offers from fulfillment partners (as described more fully below), such as automotive dealers or banks, who can provide services or products to users that Source does not directly provide.  In these instances, your personal information will be provided to third parties who compensate Source for leads delivered to such third parties.   
	</p><p><i><b>Participating Vendors.</b></i>  
	Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors.  On sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we will also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the information related to the order.  Participating vendors may use that information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they provide.  
	</p><p><i><b>Credit Card Companies; Third Party Payment Services; Third Party Promotional Sites.</b></i>  
	As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost.  Source will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company.  In some cases, we use third party payment and transaction services to facilitate your transactions and process your orders.  In such cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with the third party payment services solely for the purpose of completing the transaction or processing your order.  In some cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with third parties who may offer you a gift or promotional offer as a result of your purchase or subscription to a Source product or publication.  
	</p><p><i><b>Fulfillment Partners.</b></i> 
	Some of our web sites are intended to facilitate transactions between you and a third party.  To do so, we collect and share additional personal information, like credit information, so such third parties can provide the product or service you request.  As our fulfillment partners may keep and use your information whether or not you purchase their products or use their services, your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies.  
	</p><p><i><b>Other Third Parties.</b></i>  
	We may share your personal information with third parties, such as advertisers, sponsors, and other promotional and business partners, only when you have not opted out of receiving communications from third parties.  If you wish to opt-out of receiving third party communications, you may exercise this right by following the opt-out procedures contained in any e-mail or written communication Source sends to you or by following the procedures set forth in Section VII of this Privacy Policy.  
	</p><p><i><b>Public Postings.</b></i>  
	You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through Source's web sites or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others.  Accordingly, you should use caution when sharing any personal information with others in any community area (whether through Source's web sites or any other service available online).  
	</p><p><i><b>Required Disclosures of Information.</b></i> 
	We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our sites and our property and assure adherence to our terms of use; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation or process.  
	</p><p><i><b>Changes in Corporate Structure.</b></i>  
	In developing our business, we might sell certain assets, or the company, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred.  In such transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.

<tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">
	<p>A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line.  Source employs a variety of these technologies, including web beacons (see below), web analytics techniques, and other behavior marketing technologies, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers.  Many of these technologies are provided to Source via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior.  In the course of using these behavioral marketing technologies, we automatically collect non-personal information from you, including but not limited to the following types of information: Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login, e-mail address; computer and connection information such as browser type and related browser data; content viewed; and purchase history, which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.
	</p><p>Some of our web pages, promotional e-mail messages, and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs.  Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of our web sites and to track the number of users who have opened and acted up our promotional e-mail messages.  Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.
