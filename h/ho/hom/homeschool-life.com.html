<h2>
	<strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong></h2>
<p>
	Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and our terms of service is at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>
<h2>
	<strong>The Information We Collect:</strong></h2>
<p>
	This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Homeschool-Life.com website. On some pages, you can request membership registration in your respective Homeschool group web site. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:</p>

<h2>
	<strong>The Way We Use Information:</strong></h2>
<p>
	We use the information you provide about yourself when placing a membership registration only to complete your registration into your respective homeschool group. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the membership registration</p>
<p>
	Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>

<p>
	Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.

Collecting children information is solely the responsibility of the web site administrator for each respective homeschool group.</p>
<h2>
	<strong>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</strong></h2>
<p>
	You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by using your secure login that each members sets up to login into their own personal profile account that is maintained by each member. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.</p>
<p>
	You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by updating that information yourself; each member has access to update their own family information.</p>
