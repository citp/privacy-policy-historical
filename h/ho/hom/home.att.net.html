<h2 id="privacy">AT&amp;T's Online Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
Protecting privacy is not a new endeavor for AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T has a 
long-standing tradition of recognizing and protecting the privacy of 
customers who use its telecommunications networks. The company maintains 
strict customer information privacy policies and uses state of the art 
technologies to safeguard customer information and communications from 
unauthorized intrusions.
</p>

<p>
AT&amp;T recognizes that the growth of online services, including 
Internet services, has created additional privacy concerns, particularly 
for consumers.
</p>

<p>
Online privacy concerns focus primarily on the protection of 
"customer identifiable" information which an individual or other customer 
reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, 
"customer identifiable" information is information that, when 
associated with an individual identifies that individual,  for 
example, a customer's name, address,  telephone number, and e-mail address.
</p>
 
<p>
Some Internet users may also wish to know who can learn about what 
they do on the Internet, even when that online behavior is not 
directly linked to any information that identifies an individual. 
For example, advertisers may observe whether visitors to a Web site 
see or respond to online advertising without knowing who those visitors are.
</p>

<p>
It is common practice and often a necessity for companies, governments, 
or other organizations to collect customer identifiable information 
in order to conduct business and offer services. For example, a 
telecommunications provider may collect customer identifiable 
information, such as name, address, telephone number, and a variety 
of other information in the course of billing and providing telephone 
service to a customer.
</p>
 
<p>
Some activities on the Internet follow very familiar patterns. Consumers 
signing up for an Internet access service, for example, are usually 
asked to provide name, address, telephone number and credit card and 
other information that is typical when the consumer orders a product 
or service. Similarly, business Web sites may ask visitors to supply 
information about themselves, particularly when information, services 
or merchandise are requested, but often simply to be able to better 
target the company's services to the customer's interests and requirements.

<h2 id="choice">AT&amp;T's Online Privacy Policy: Informed Choice</h2>

<p>
AT&amp;T has put in place the following Online Privacy Policy. 
This policy covers AT&amp;T and its subsidiaries, except 
AT&amp;T Wireless Services (www.attws.com), now a separate company,
and Advanced American Telephones (www.telephones.att.com) which 
licenses the AT&amp;T Brand to sell telephone equipment. 

AT&amp;T will continue to 
protect customer information derived from its local, long distance, 
cable and wireless services consistent with federal laws and with 
federal regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</p>

<h2 id="protects">How AT&amp;T Protects Your Privacy Online</h2>

<p>
<strong>Collection and Use:</strong> AT&amp;T will collect and use 
customer identifiable information for billing purposes, to provide 
and change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your 
service, or to create and inform you of products and services that 
better meet your needs. This means that AT&amp;T may use your customer 
identifiable information, in conjunction with information available 
from other sources, to market new services to you that we think will 
be of interest to you, but we will not disclose your customer 
identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you.
</p>

<p>
When you access the Internet, the computers that host Web sites you 
visit (Web servers) automatically receive some anonymous information. 
This "usage data" may include a record of which pages a Web browser 
has visited. AT&amp;T servers receive usage data when customers 
visit AT&amp;T Web sites, and when AT&amp;T WorldNet members visit 
other sites as well. AT&amp;T may use usage data to provide advertising 
about goods and services that may be of interest to AT&amp;T customers, 
or to provide customized features and services.  AT&amp;T will not use 
information about your activities on the Internet together with any 
information that identifies you without your consent.
</p>

<p>
AT&amp;T and its advertisers may use various kinds of software devices 
to collect information about Internet use. Small files called "cookies" 
may be attached to your Web browser.  These files identify your browser 
and save information such as passwords so that Web sites can recognize 
you.  You can set your browser to disable cookies, but some AT&amp;T 
Web sites (and other Web sites) may not work properly if you do this.  
<a href="http://care.att.net/bulletins/cookies.html">More information 
about cookies</a>.
</p>

<p>
In addition, on some Web sites, AT&amp;T and its advertisers may use 
small bits of code called "one-pixel gifs," or "clear gifs" embedded 
in some Web pages, to make cookies more effective.   AT&amp;T will not 
associate the information these software devices collect with your name 
or email address.
</p>

<p>
AT&amp;T uses advertising companies to deliver ads on some 
AT&amp;T Web sites.  The advertising companies may also receive 
some anonymous information about ad viewing by Internet users on 
AT&amp;T Web sites and other Internet sites. This information may 
be associated with a customer's Web browser, but cannot be 
associated with a name or e-mail address without the customer's 
permission.  (This means that advertising companies may know where 
your computer goes on the Internet, but they don't know who you 
are unless you tell them.) AT&amp;T does not supply customer 
identifiable information to advertising companies or to individual 
advertisers or other third parties. If you go to another Web site, 
including an advertiser's Web site (for example by clicking on an ad), 
and request information or enter a contest, be aware that you may be 
authorizing another company, including an advertising company, to 
use information you supply. 

<a href="advertising.html">Find out more</a>
about the advertising companies that deliver ads on 
AT&amp;T Web sites, read their privacy policies, and choose
whether to let them collect information about what you do on 
the Internet. 
</p>  

<p>
<strong>Disclosure:</strong> AT&amp;T will not sell, trade, or disclose 
to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the 
registration for or use of an AT&amp;T online service -- including 
customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer 
(except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process 
or in the case of imminent physical harm to the customer or others). 
When AT&amp;T uses other agents, contractors or companies to perform 
services on its behalf, AT&amp;T will ensure that the company protects 
your customer identifiable information consistent with this Policy. 
If AT&amp;T includes your name and any other customer identifiable 
information in a directory that AT&amp;T creates from information we 
receive as an online service provider, the company will give you the 
opportunity to have your information excluded from that directory. 
Business directories that AT&amp;T creates may, however, contain 
information obtained from other sources.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Customer Choice:</strong> A customer may choose not to receive 
direct marketing communications from AT&amp;T in connection with AT&amp;T 
online services. Upon such choice, AT&amp;T (a) will not contact that 
customer directly with marketing messages about AT&amp;T online services, 
and (b) will not use customer identifiable information obtained from 
that customer's registration for or use of an online service to contact 
that customer with marketing messages about any AT&amp;T products or 
services. A customer may choose not to receive such messages by e-mail, 
by mail, or by telephone.

<p>
Customer-identifiable information which a visitor volunteers at one 
of the AT&amp;T Web Sites to order AT&amp;T services other than online 
services will be protected just as if the information had been provided 
under more traditional ways of ordering that service.
</p>
 
<p>
<strong>Security:</strong> AT&amp;T has implemented technology and 
security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy 
of your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or 
improper use, and we will continue to enhance our security procedures 
as new technology becomes available.
</p>
 
<p>
<strong>E-mail Contents:</strong> The company will not read or disclose 
to third parties private e-mail communications that are transmitted 
using AT&amp;T services except as required to operate the service or 
as otherwise authorized by law.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Improper Conduct:</strong> AT&amp;T may also use customer 
identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially 
unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise 
violates the customer agreement for that service.
</p>
 
<p>
<strong>Account Information:</strong> AT&amp;T honors requests from 
customers to review all customer identifiable information maintained 
in reasonably retrievable form, which currently consists of your name, 
address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or billing information, 
and will correct any such information which may be inaccurate. 
Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have been made.

<h2 id="children">Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet</h2>

<p>
AT&amp;T joins the industry in recognizing that children, including 
young teens, may not be able to make informed choices about personal 
information requested online.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, AT&amp;T does not target children or teenagers 
(younger than eighteen years of age) for collection of information 
online. AT&amp;T does not solicit or collect customer identifiable 
information targeted at children and teenagers under eighteen and 
does not allow anyone else to do so on an AT&amp;T Web site. In 
addition, the editorial content of AT&amp;T Web sites designed for 
children will not knowingly promote or link to any third party Web 
site that collects customer identifiable information unless that Web 
site publishes a privacy policy that is easily accessible.
</p>
 
<p>
In addition, on all of its online services and AT&amp;T Web sites, 
AT&amp;T will encourage children to seek the consent of their parents 
before providing any information about themselves or their households 
to anyone on the Internet.
</p>
 
<p>
AT&amp;T encourages parents to take an active role to protect the privacy 
and security of their children and to prevent the inappropriate use of 
information about their children. AT&amp;T supports the development of 
technologies that help parents to control the collection and use of 
personal information from children who use online services in their 
households.
</p>

<p>
Finally, AT&amp;T complies with all Federal laws and regulations, including 
the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA), which requires the consent of 
a parent or guardian for the collection of personally identifiable information 
from children under 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian. 
</p>

<h2 id="cpni">Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)</h2>

<p>
Under federal law you have a right, and AT&amp;T has a duty, to protect
the confidentiality of CPNI. AT&amp;T is currently permitted to use CPNI,
without further action by you or by AT&amp;T, to offer additional services
of the type you already purchase from AT&amp;T. We would like to use your
CPNI to offer you new and different communications-related products and
services. Before we can do that, AT&amp;T is required to provide this
notice and an opportunity for you to deny AT&amp;T's use of your CPNI.
Except as required by law, AT&amp;T will not sell, trade or share your CPNI
with anyone outside of AT&amp;T other than its duly authorized agents and
affiliates.
</p>

<p>
CPNI is information that relates to the telecommunications services you
buy from AT&amp;T, including the types of services, how much you use them,
how they are provided and related calling and billing records. CPNI does
not include your telephone number, name, and address.
</p>

<p>
We will not use your CPNI until 33 days after a notice is sent to you.
If at any time you would prefer that AT&amp;T not use your CPNI to offer
you other communications-related products and services, you only need to
call AT&amp;T at <span class="phone">+1 (800) 645-6309</span> from your home phone. If you receive
separate bills for additional telephone numbers, you will need to call from
each such billed telephone number should you prefer that AT&amp;T not use
your CPNI for that telephone number. Any approval or denial of approval,
for the use of your CPNI is valid until you affirmatively revoke such
approval or denial. Denial of approval will not affect the services that
AT&amp;T provides you or the manner in which the services are provided.
