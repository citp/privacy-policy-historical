We do not collect your name or email address. No information we collect in this way is directly or indirectly traceable back to a specific person. 

We use this information for general statistical modeling, in order to measure the number of visitors to different pages on our site and to modify the site in order to make the site more helpful. We also use this information to monitor network traffic and to identify unauthorized access or unusual activity on the site. Third parties may help us use this information as described. However, we do not sell this information to third party companies for any purpose.

We may use this information to send an answer to your question or deliver requested information to you. We may use your contact information in order to provide you information in which we believe you will be interested. At any time you may request that we no longer contact you. We also may use information that you provide to measure general statistics about visits to our site and interest in particular areas. We do not sell this information to third party companies. We may disclose information from website visitors to third parties, such as contractors, consultants and other service providers, so that the third party can provide a business, professional or technical support function for the website visitor or for Freddie Mac. By sending an email or making a request or inquiry, you agree to permit Freddie Mac to keep and use the information you have given us consistent with this policy.

The calculator's functions are performed by your computer. The results are displayed in your browser and viewable only by you. 

If you enter information in an online form to register as a Freddie Mac supplier or to use business tools, we may keep this information. We may use the business information that you provide in the registration in order to verify your eligibility as a supplier or to use the business tool that you wish to use, or to provide you access to a service.

We do not sell the information you provide in this manner to third party companies. Except as described in this paragraph, this website privacy policy statement does not apply to information provided to us by suppliers or any other business entities, even if the information is transmitted to us through this website.
