                <strong>What Information We Collect</strong><br>
                <br>
                When you shop with us, we collect the personal information you provide us in connection with your purchase transaction, such as your name and telephone number.

                <br>
                We and some of our third-party service providers use cookies. A cookie is a small text file written by an Internet server to a website user's browser where information is exchanged between them, and which is stored on a computer's hard drive to allow us to recognize and track users on our Website to assist us in providing our customers with a productive online experience. Cookies enable us to store information about your use of our Website such as the areas you visit and the length of your stay. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies and can be reset by using the "Help" portion of the toolbar to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

                <br>
                <strong>How We Use the Information We Collect</strong><br>
                <br>
                When we do collect information from you, we may use it for a number of purposes, including to:
            </p><ul>
              <li>process and complete your purchase 
                transaction; 
   
     </li><li>identify your product and service 
                preferences so that we can notify you of new or additional 
                products, services and promotions relating to the TJX Businesses 
                that might be of interest to you; 
   
      </li><li>improve merchandise selections and 
                customer service; 
   
          </li><li>notify you about new services, features,

                think you will find valuable; 
   
          </li><li>respond to your inquiries; 
   
         </li><li>administer your participation in 
                promotions, contests and sweepstakes in which you have chosen to 
                participate; 
   
        </li><li>measure the advertising effectiveness of 
                our online and other advertisements and offers; 
   
        </li><li>help us understand Website activity and 
                improve your use of our Website; and 
   
        </li><li>help us prevent fraud, and minimize credit risk.</li>
            </ul>
            In order for us to maintain the accuracy of your personal information and improve our communication with you, we may also combine the information we collect with other public demographic information. On rare occasions we may also be required to disclose your information as is required by law pursuant to lawful requests such as subpoenas, court or agency orders, or as we may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to avert harm to persons or property, or to enforce our Website Terms of Use or this Privacy and Security Policy.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Those With Whom We Share Your Information</strong><br>
              <br>
              We may share your personal information among the TJX Businesses (which are affiliates owned by TJX, including HomeGoods, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, A.J. Wright, Bob's Stores, Winners, HomeSense, and T.K. Maxx). They may use this information to offer products and services to you consistent with the purposes identified in this statement. Your information may also be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any transfers made as a part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of the TJX Businesses or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in corporate control.<br>
              <br>
              If a contest, sweepstakes or promotion is jointly sponsored by us and one or more other sponsors, your information may be shared with such sponsors. We do not control other sponsors' use of your personal information, and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to participate in such jointly sponsored contests, sweepstakes or promotions. Such promotions may also be subject to additional rules and regulations governing your participation.<br>
              <br>
              We may also share certain personal information we collect about you with third parties who perform services for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy and Security Policy. For example, we may use third parties to host our Website, operate certain of its features, send e-mails, print or send mailings, run our sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, authorize and process your payments, and analyze data and our advertising effectiveness. These third-party service providers are given the information that they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information for their own or any others' marketing purposes.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Policies for Children </strong><br>
              <br>
              We do not seek nor will we knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Links</strong><br>
              <br>
              When you use our Website, you may discover that it may contain links to other sites that are not owned or operated by the TJX Businesses. Also, links to our Website may be featured on other websites on which we advertise. These links are not intended to be referrals or endorsements of the linked or host sites, and the TJX Businesses do not warrant, represent or assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy, security, completeness or operation of any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site) or any host site, or the practices or privacy and other policies contained in any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site) or any host site. We advise you to familiarize yourself, therefore, with the specific legal, privacy and security information contained in any such linked or host sites.<br>
              <br>
              Our Website also contains links to other websites operated by the other TJX Businesses. We advise you to review the legal, privacy and security information for each such site to which you link, as the terms and conditions of use and the personal information you provide may vary from website to website. <br>
              <br>
              We may use third parties to serve our advertisements on other websites. These companies may use online tools such as pixel tags to report certain information (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our Website and the websites which advertise and feature links to our Website, in order to measure the advertising effectiveness of our ads. We contractually restrict these companies from using your personally identifiable information for their own or any others' marketing purposes, or from sharing your personal information with anyone other than the TJX Businesses.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong><br>
              <br>
              We employ various security measures designed to help protect the personal information that we collect from you online. We have instituted software firewalls to protect our servers and network. Unfortunately, no collection or transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information.<br>

              <br>
              YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong><br>              <a name="CA"></a>
              <br>
              If you are a California resident, California law provides that you be given the opportunity to opt-out of our sharing your personal information with third parties which would use such personal information for direct marketing. Absent such an opt-out, we may share your information with other TJX Businesses (which are affiliates owned by TJX, including HomeGoods, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, A.J. Wright, and Bob's Stores), to provide you with information about their products, services or promotions that we think may be of interest to you; or your information could be transferred to a successor to HomeGoods in the event of a merger, sale or corporate reorganization involving HomeGoods. Accordingly, per California law, we provide a way for you to opt-out if you do not want us to share your information in this manner.<br>
              <br>
              California residents can opt-out of our sharing your information as described above by contacting Customer Service, Monday - Friday 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) at the following toll-free number: 1-800-888-0776, and requesting that you would like to opt-out from receiving all marketing communications from HomeGoods and all other TJX Businesses. If you have already received communications from us, it will expedite the opt-out process if you are prepared to provide us with the exact name, and e-mail and/or postal mail addresses under which you have been receiving communications from us. Please note that it may take us up to thirty (30) days to fully process your opt-out request.<br>
