**YOUR PRIVACY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY**

At Home Box, we respect your privacy and protecting it is our responsibility. Like all other websites, we may collect certain information from you either voluntarily or involuntarily. For more information, read on.

**BROWSING**

This Web site  does not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.

We collect the HTTP request header information to make our Web site function correctly and to see how we can tune it to serve you better. We may also use this information for statistical analysis like time spent, geographic location and systems and programs used to access the Website and may publish such analyses from time to time.
