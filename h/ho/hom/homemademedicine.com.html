                          <p>Personal Information<br>
                            The HMM may collect personally identifiable information 
                            such as name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail 
                            address, institution affiliation, credit card number, 
                            checking account number, or date of birth through 
                            various activities of the Society. This personal information 
                            is collected and used by HMM staff for the purpose 
                            of facilitating a relationship or business transaction. 
                          </p>
                          <p>The HMM website resides behind a firewall and uses 
                            SSL (Secure Sockets Layer, the industry-standard security 
                            protocol used to communicate with browsers) to transmit 
                            personal information. Data is strongly encrypted during 
                            transmission to ensure that personal and payment information 
                            is secure. Industry-standard data encryption techniques 
                            are used to protect personal information on HMM computers. 
                            SSL-capable browsers typically have a symbol on the 
                            browser window to indicate when they are in a secure 
                            mode. In addition, the URL will begin with "https:" 
                            for all browsers.</p>
                          <p>E-mail<br>
                            The HMM does not sell or rent e-mail addresses to 
                            other organizations. Certain e-mail addresses may 
                            be published in both print and electronic HMM publications 
                            including the HMM website. The HMM may generate e-mail 
                            for the following types of communication: <br>
                            Notification e-mail to which the individual may subscribe 
                            and unsubscribe. <br>
                            Transactional e-mail, which is the result of a business 
                            transaction initiated with the HMM. <br>
                            Relationship e-mail, which is sent as an informational 
                            service because of a relationship with the HMM. <br>
                            Commercial e-mail, which is sent to promote an HMM 
                            product or service (You may opt not to receive this 
                            type of e-mail). <br>
                            Correspondence from HMM staff as a result of a communication 
                            initiated by a member or customer. <br>
                            E-mail that has a provision for opt-out will include 
                            instructions on how to do so. All inquiries regarding 
                            subscription-based e-mails should be directed to the 
                            HMM Member and Customer Services Department (see HMM 
                            Contact Information below). </p>
                          <p>Mailing Lists<br>
                            Postal mailing list’s, comprised of full name and 
                            postal address, may be sold to other organizations 
                            (e.g. professional societies and/or commercial publishers) 
                            for one-time promotional or informational use. Promotional 
                            or informational materials are subject to HMM approval 
                            prior to the rental. E-mail addresses are not included 
                            in mailing lists.</p>
                          <p>The HMM may occasionally send informational or promotional 
                            materials to members and customers. You may choose 
                            to exclude yourself from all, none, or only non-HMM 
                            mailings by contacting the Member and Customer Services 
                            Department (see HMM Contact Information).</p>
                          <p>Third-party Agents <br>
                            The HMM uses third-party agents for several business 
                            purposes, including credit card validation, hotel 
                            registration, and shipping. These agents are permitted 
                            to use your personal information only to provide the 
                            HMM with a specific service and not for any other 
                            purpose. Please contact the HMM Member and Customer 
                            Service Department (see HMM Contact Information) if 
                            you believe this policy has been violated.</p>
                          <p>The HMM makes every effort to preserve your privacy, 
                            but we may need to disclose personal information when 
                            required by law. The HMM may also disclose personal 
                            information if it believes in good faith that such 
                            action is necessary.</p>
                          <p>Non-personal Information <br>
                            Non-personal information is collected behind the scenes 
                            by the HMM web server and is used to compile general 
                            website usage statistics or facilitate access to restricted 
                            website services. Such information includes:</p>
                          <p>IP address of computer <br>
                            Browser-related information <br>
                            Locations visited on the website <br>
                            HTTP cookies <br>
                            IP address<br>
                            IP address is used to verify access rights of licensed 
                            subscribers to HMM products that require license agreements, 
                            such as HMM Electronic Journals. They also aid in 
                            the general administration of the website.</p>
                          <p>HTTP Cookies<br>
                            A HTTP Cookie is a piece of data that is stored by 
                            your browser in either your computer’s memory or on 
                            your computer’s hard drive. The HMM uses cookies to 
                            keep track of user session identity on the website, 
                            such as tracking items in a bookstore shopping cart 
                            or maintaining access to restricted website services 
                            via the HMM Web Account. Cookies are also used to 
                            track the effectiveness of various services provided 
                            on the HMM website. Browsers generally allow you to 
                            disable cookies. Services on the HMM website that 
                            require a login to an HMM web account require that 
                            cookies are enabled.</p>
                          <p>Public Forums<br>
                            Several public forums are hosted on the HMM website. 
                            The inherent public nature of these forums dictates 
                            that the HMM assumes no responsibility for protecting 
                            the information disclosed on them by users. Please 
                            exercise caution when disclosing personal information 
                            in public forums.</p>
                          <p>External Links<br>
                            The only domain covered by the HMM privacy policy 
                            is HMM.com. The HMM website may contain links to other 
                            sites, however, and the HMM is not responsible for 
                            the privacy practices or content of those external
