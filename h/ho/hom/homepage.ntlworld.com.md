# ntl.com | Privacy Policy

  


## 1\. Introduction

We take the security and privacy of customer information seriously, and we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. As a business, **ntl** is built on the bedrock of building long term relationships with customers.

If you leave, we have failed. So we make every effort not to breach privacy and risk customer offence for short-term financial gain. Your data is about you, **ntl** , and how we work together. This guide describes how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide us with when you use our online services.

Personal data is the information you supply that identifies you, for example, your name and address. Anonymous data is information that does not identify you personally, for example, the average length of visit to one of our sites is 10 minutes.

 **ntl** 's primary reason for collecting personal data is to provide you with a more enjoyable and personalised service. We also collect data so that we can understand and identify our customers' needs and habits, with the aim of making each online experience a better one. Personalisation is designed to save you time and effort, by providing a service tailored to your individual requirements. Understanding your needs means we are in a better position to meet them, and we can do this by looking at how you use our services.

Please take a moment to read our Privacy Policy, so you know what choices you have about the information we may ask you for. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

## 2\. What Information Do We Hold and Where Do We Get It From?

 **Information about your visits to our services:**  
 **ntl** may gather data about what pages you visit within the service, how long you stayed on a page, and the route you took to navigate through the pages. This information helps us monitor the accessibility of our service, and what your needs might be. It also helps us to develop and improve our service generally, in direct response to customer requirements.

 **Purchase history:**  
 **ntl** may collect information about your online purchases, in order to suggest other products and services which may be of interest.

 **Personal details:**  
When you register with **ntl** we collect personal details from you, including information such as your name and address. This helps us to build a customer profile, from which we can provide a personalised service, unique to you. The greater the information we have from you, the more personalised service we can provide.

We may also ask you for personal details at other times, for example, if we run a market research questionnaire, competition, sweepstake or promotion. However, the majority of this data collection, is not compulsory.

Your personal information may be obtained in any of the following ways:

  * Online registration
  * Online forms from time to time
  * By telephone recording (Interactive Voice Response, IVR)
  * By email or telephone
  * When dealing with an **ntl** customer services executive
  * Automatically by your internet browser
  * On Customer agreements
  * By post



 **Cookies:**

 ** _Use of Cookies on our site_**  
Like most major websites, **ntl** uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience. Cookies allow **ntl** to arrange content to match your preferred interests. The following information explains how **ntl** uses cookies on our websites.

 ** _What is a cookie?_**  
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.

We use the following types of cookies on our websites.

 _Session Cookies_  
These are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site. We use these cookies:

  * To allow information to carry across pages of our site and avoid you having to re-enter information
  * To allow you to maintain a shopping basket
  * Within registration to allow you to access stored information



 _Persistent cookies_  
These cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. We use these cookies:

  * To help us recognise you as a unique visitor (just a number) when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests
  * To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way.



 _Third Party Cookies_  
We also allow third parties to serve cookies via this site. These are used for the following purposes:

  * To count the number of anonymous users of our site and allow us to better understand user activity
  * To tailor content to your preferences
  * To serve advertisements on our site and track whether these advertisements are clicked on by users
  * To control how often you are shown a particular advertisement
  * To tailor content to your preferences
  * To provide security within shopping baskets or transactions



 ** _Advertising_**  
Internet advertisements on the **ntl** web sites are served through 24/7 Real Media Open AdStream technology. 24/7 Real Media does not collect personal identifiable information (such as name, address, phone number and email address) that may be used to identify **ntl** users. Only anonymous information about your Internet browser and Web surfing is collected and used to better determine which ads to show you and to prevent repetitive ads being delivered to the same user. 24/7 Real Media and **ntl** are firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering consumer confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing.

 ** _Web Beacons_**  
Some of our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes known as clear gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited these pages. Web beacons collect only limited information which usually includes a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. We may also carry web beacons placed by third party advertisers. These beacons do not carry any personally identifiable information and are only used to track the effectiveness of a particular campaign.

 ** _Your preferences / Disabling cookies_**  
To ensure you get the best from our websites, we advise that users keep cookies active on their machine whilst visiting **ntl** websites. You can manually disable and enable cookies on your PC. The process will depend on your browser and is usually part of your 'Security Settings'. For further information about managing and disabling cookies, you can refer to your browser's help section or user guide. Alternatively, the Interactive Advertising Bureau has produced a series of web pages (see www.allaboutcookies.org) which explain to users how cookies work and can be managed.

 ** _What happens if I use a link from this site to another site?_**

Please be aware that our site may provide access to other web sites by linking to them. We are not responsible for the data policies (including data protection and cookies), content or security of these linked web sites.

 **Preferences:**  
 **ntl** may ask you for information about your leisure interests and lifestyle. Again this is in an effort to provide a more personalised service for you, and the greater the information we have, the more able we are to do this.

## 3\. What Does **ntl** Do With Your Personal Information?

 **Your Personal Information:**  
 **ntl** will combine the different types of data held to create a membership profile for each customer. This helps us to provide you with a personalised service, most accurately suited to your needs. This is a continuing process as you continue to use our services, and is in direct response to the amount of information we are supplied with by you. The more information we have, the better service we can provide.

When you apply for **ntl** 's products and services, you agree to the following:

 **ntl** may search the files of credit reference agencies which may keep a record of that search. Details of how you conduct your account may also be disclosed to such agencies. We will check your details with fraud detection agencies and if you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this. We and other organisations may use and search these records to:- help make decisions about credit and credit related services, for you and other members of your household; help make decisions on motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims, for you and other members of your household; trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud, and to manage your accounts or insurance policies; check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you furnish us with other satisfactory proof of your identity. If you want to receive details of those fraud prevention agencies from whom we obtain and with whom we record information about you, please send your request to **ntl** 's Group Compliance Officer, **ntl** , Bartley Wood Business Park, Hook, Hampshire, RG27 9UP or email to [privacy@ **ntl**.com](mailto:privacy@ntl.com). You have a legal right to these details.

 **ntl** may use your personal information for the purposes of administering your account, providing you with the services you have requested and providing you with information about these services. **ntl** may use your personal information for training purposes. **ntl** may disclose your personal information to other members of the **ntl** group of companies and its sub-contractors for these purposes

 **ntl** may analyse your call, billing, viewing and interactive data from time to time to help us identify and tell you of savings or services that we think will be of interest to you. If you do not wish us to do this, please contact **ntl** Customer Services. From time to time, **ntl** may also send you information, including discounts and special offers on **ntl** products and services. If you do not wish to receive this information by post, telephone or electronic mail, please contact **ntl** Customer Services. You also agree that, from time to time, **ntl** may pass your details on to carefully selected reputable companies so that they can send you information on their products and services, including discounts and special offers which we think will be of interest to you, or we may send this information to you on their behalf. If you do not wish to receive this information on other companies products and services by post, telephone or electronic mail, please contract **ntl** Customer Services. 

**Anonymous aggregate reports:**  
 **ntl** may provide reports to third parties, for example content partners and advertisers, as well as to **ntl** management to enhance the service. These reports will be anonymous summaries used to monitor the success of our content and advertising, and to help us develop a service in line with customer need. From our aggregate reports we can provide general information about our service, for example, '10,000 people clicked on an advertisement yesterday', or '20% of our customers are over 40 years old'.

## 4\. Who Else Gets To See your information?

We won't pass on personal information to third parties unless we have your consent, or where we are required by law to disclose that information.

With your consent, **ntl** may give your details to third party organisations so they can contact you with recommendations for products and services. **ntl** may sometimes hold promotions with other companies. In this case, some of the data collected at this time would be shared with the sponsor. If so, you will be told about this before your data is collected.

If you request additional information from an advertiser or sponsor you will in effect be giving **ntl** consent to provide them with the personal details needed for them to fulfil your request.

We may offer you the choice of saving your credit card details on a secure site, instead of providing them every time you make a purchase online. This information is encrypted and made secure, but may be accessed by **ntl** , on behalf of **ntl** partners, when making a secure transaction.

From time to time, **ntl** may also ask you questions about your tastes and preferences. With your consent we might pass this information to **ntl** partners so they can customise their online services to meet your needs.

## 5\. What choices do you have?

You have the right to object to your personal details being used by us to send you direct marketing by post or to contact you by telephone or email for these purposes. You may also object to us analysing your call, billing, viewing and interactive data from time to time to help us to identify and tell you of savings or services that we think will be of interest to you. You can also object to us providing your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes. 

You can make these choices during the registration/application process simply by ticking the relevant boxes provided, or by contacting us at any time.

You may set your PC to refuse cookies or ask your browser to show you when a cookie is being set up. Please refer to section 2 for more details on cookies.

## 6\. Protecting Children’s Privacy

Safeguarding the personal information of children is very important to **ntl**.

Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission before sending personal information to anyone online, and, at **ntl** , we encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. Where **ntl** have reasons to believe that a user is under 18, we try to collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary for the effective operation of the service. **ntl** also endeavours not to share with third parties any personal information supplied by users believed to be aged under 18.

In addition, **ntl** aims not to send direct email offers to users who indicate they are aged under 18. No information should be submitted to, or posted on, **ntl** services by visitors under the age of 18 without the consent of their parent or guardian.

## 7\. Looking After Your Data

 **ntl** is committed to data security. We have implemented technical, managerial, and operational security, rules, procedures and measures, to ensure that your personal information is held within operating environments that are not available to the public. We take steps to guard against unauthorised access, improper use, alteration, destruction, and accidental loss of personal data. This includes rules for all **ntl** staff with access to the servers or databases that hold your personal information. Although we make every effort to create a secure environment for your personal information, **ntl** cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information you transmit to **ntl** online.

In any event, we will not ask you for your **ntl** identification and authentication passwords or PIN numbers in an unsolicited phone call or unsolicited email. You should not disclose your password or PIN to anyone.

## 8\. When does the **ntl** privacy policy not apply?

Please note that this policy only applies to the collection and use of data by **ntl** and not to other companies, individuals, and organisations to which we provide links through our interactive services.

This privacy policy does not cover advertisers and content partners within our service who may also collect your personal details. These companies should have their own privacy policies.

If you place any of your personal details on any services we might develop for chat, bulletin boards, emails, your personal home page or public profile page or any other publicly accessible page, then under these circumstances data will not be covered by this privacy policy.

 **ntl** advises its customers to be cautious of providing their personal information, such as contact information like email address, postal address, telephone or name, to organisations on the open web. Customers are advised always to read a web site's privacy policy before submitting personal information.
