<h2>  HomeOwnersHub.com  Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us by visiting our <a title=" HomeOwnersHub.com  Contact Page" href="/contact.php">contact form page </a></p>
<p>At <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>, the privacy of our visitors is of extreme importance to us. This privacy policy document outlines what type of personal information is collected and stored by <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> and how it is used.
</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
Like most website operators, <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>'s visitors use its website. From time to time, <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
<p></p> 

<p>
<em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> forums. <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
</p>

<p>
</p><h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
Certain visitors to <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>'s websites choose to interact with <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> in ways that require <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a forum user account at <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> to provide a username and email address as well as, <u>optionally</u>, the first and last name. Those who engage in transactions with <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> - by purchasing a product or service, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>. <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
<p></p>

<p>
</p><h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
<p></p>

<p>
</p><h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>'s behalf or to provide services available at <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>'s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>'s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em>, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> website and have supplied your email address, <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> and our products. We expect to keep this type of email communication to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. <em> HomeOwnersHub.com </em> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
