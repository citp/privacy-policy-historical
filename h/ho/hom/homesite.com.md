# Homesite Insurance - Privacy Statement

**Homesite's Privacy Policies**

At Homesite, we respect the privacy of our customers and our web site visitors. This policy statement is intended to inform you about our policies with respect to the collection of information from you and how it is used at Homesite. The information you provide us is primarily used to enhance your relationship with us and to better serve the collective needs of our visitors and customers. We also recognize that this information belongs to you and that we must treat it accordingly. This policy applies to www.homesite.com and all other sites on the World Wide Web owned and operated by Homesite Group Inc.

**Use of Personal and Non-personal Information**  
At Homesite, we collect two kinds of information about our on-line visitors: personal and non-personal. Visitors are not required to register to access the public pages of Homesite's sites; however, non-personal information is collected to track the total number of guests visiting Homesite sites and the portions of the site most commonly visited. This information helps guide our efforts to improve our site. The non-personal visitor information we monitor includes the browser type and operating system being used; areas of our sites visited; date and time of access; host or service-provider information, and identification of the referring site. This information is used for our internal purposes and is not disclosed to any non-affiliated third parties.

Personal information that can identify a visitor, such as name, address or information about your home, is collected only when voluntarily offered and solely for purposes that are clearly identified on our site. Personal information acquired through registration or requests for quotes is kept confidential, but we may share the personal information you provide us with third parties, as permitted by law, in connection with applications, claims, or other routine transactions relating to your insurance with Homesite.

When you request a quote or apply for a policy, Homesite may also collect personal information from sources other than you or someone else named in your application. We may disclose this information, or information that we collect later in connection with your Homesite insurance policy, to third parties without your authorization in certain circumstances, as permitted by law. You have a right to request access to the information in our files, and a right to request that we correct, amend, or delete personal information in our records. Further details of Homesite's information practices are available as part of the quote or application process.

**Security**  
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Homesite cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online applications, products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our internal systems.

**Use of Cookies**  
Homesite may place an electronic "cookie" in the browser files of a guest's computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your browser, which can then be stored on an individual's computer hard drive for record-keeping purposes or to provide you with tailored information. Cookies themselves do not enable us to access any personal information about our visitors; however, they do allow Homesite to analyze guests' use of our sites. This analysis helps us better understand which areas of our site are most useful and popular so we can plan improvements and updates accordingly. Homesite does not use cookies to retrieve information from a visitor's computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Homesite will never save passwords, credit card or other sensitive information in cookies. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. For more information on cookies and their use, please refer to the Help facility within your browser. Use of IP Addresses An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are connected to the Internet and surfing the Web. Web pages automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Homesite collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from Homesite, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

**Business Transfers**  
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Homesite, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

**Children's Guidelines**  
Homesite encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. No information should be submitted to Homesite by guests under 18 (eighteen) years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. Whenever possible, Homesite will not collect online contact information or personally identifiable offline contact information of individuals under 18 (eighteen) years of age without prior parental consent. Homesite will not give the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information of individuals under 18 (eighteen) years of age without prior parental consent.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Guests should be aware that when you are visiting any of Homesite's sites, you might be directed to other sites that we do not control. This may include public information sites, partners, advertisers and sponsors. These sites may have their own policies regarding privacy, the collection of personal information and use of cookies. Homesite is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other web sites.
