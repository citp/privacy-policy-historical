# Homesite - Home Insurance

**Your Rights**

**Use of Consumer Reports**

Homesite Group Incorporated uses information from consumer reporting agencies such as your credit, claims, and insurance history. This helps us to fairly determine eligibility for our programs and ensure accurate rates for all policies.

**Insurance Claims History**

We obtain information about insurance claims history from A-PLUS. For information or to dispute any report regarding your insurance claims history, contact the A-PLUS Consumer Inquiry Center at 1-800-709-8842. Note: to protect your privacy, only you can discuss your claims history with A-PLUS (an agent won’t be able to do it for you).

**Insurance Credit Score**

_All states (excluding California and Maryland)_  
We obtain information from Trans Union Corporation to determine your insurance credit score. This inquiry will not affect your credit score, as it is considered a “soft hit”. Trans Union can provide a free copy of your credit report, and if you believe that report is inaccurate, they can respond to disputed items, but Trans Union cannot comment on your insurance application.

_Virginia_  
In connection with this application for insurance, we shall review your credit report or obtain or use an insurance credit score based on the information contained in that credit report. We may use a third party in connection with the development of your insurance credit score. You may request that your credit information be updated and if you question the accuracy of the credit information, we will, upon your request, reevaluate you based on corrected credit information from a consumer reporting agency.

_Extraordinary circumstances (CT, IA, KS, KY, MI, MT, NJ, NV, RI, NH)_  
If your credit information has been adversely impacted by an extraordinary life circumstance that has occurred within the last 3 years, you may request in writing that we consider this when using your credit information. These extraordinary life circumstances include:

  * Catastrophic event, as declared by the federal or any state government (IA, KS, KY, MI, NV, RI, NH)
  * Serious illness or injury to the consumer or the consumer’s immediate family
  * Death of a spouse, child or parent of the insured
  * Divorce (IA, KS, KY, MI, NJ, NV, RI, CT)
  * Identity theft
  * Interruption of alimony/support payments (NH)
  * Temporary loss of employment
  * Military deployment overseas (IA, KS, KY, MI, MT, NJ, NV, RI)
  * Total or other loss that makes your home uninhabitable (CT)



If you believe any of these apply to you and has impacted your credit, you may request in writing that this be taken into consideration. We will require you to provide specific documentation of this circumstance and demonstrate how it has negatively affected your credit. The request must be made no more than 60 days from the date of the application for insurance or the policy renewal. Details about how to make this request will be included with the policy documents you will receive after purchase.

**Colorado Only**

COLORADO HOMEOWNER’S, RENTER’S, AND CONDOMINIUM OWNER’S DISCLOSURE FORM

This disclosure form is a basic guide to the major coverages and exclusions in your policy. It is only a general description and not a contract or a policy of any kind. All coverages are subject to the terms, conditions, special limits, and exclusions of your policy and all applicable endorsements.

**PLEASE READ YOUR POLICY FOR DETAILS! This disclosure form shall not be construed to replace any provision of the policy itself. In the event of any conflict between the policy and this disclosure form, the provisions of the policy shall prevail.**

This disclosure form also provides some guidelines on cancellation, nonrenewal, increase in premium, and changes in coverage. These factors are general in nature and do not represent the only reasons a policy may be terminated or changed. Please contact your agent or company for further information.

  1. BASIC COVERAGES-HOMEOWNERS



Homeowners policies include two basic sections. The first section provides protection for your home and your personal property. The second section provides protection for you when you’re legally responsible (at fault) for an accident you have caused. It also includes medical payments coverage for persons, other than you or members of your household, who are injured in an accident that happens on your property. Homeowners policies do not cover automobiles.

  1. HOMEOWNERS-PROPERTY



WHAT IS COVERED:

Your policy will pay for loss or damage to your house, your furniture, and other personal belongings when caused by the losses shown in the attached chart. Only limited coverage is provided for jewelry, silverware, furs, business property, and other valuables.

Most policies have a deductible. The deductible is the amount of the loss that you, the policyholder, are responsible for paying. Your insurer will pay for the rest of the covered loss up to the policy limits.

Your policy also will pay for additional living expenses if a covered loss renders your home uninhabitable and you must temporarily live elsewhere. This coverage pays, for a specified period, for reasonable and necessary extra living expenses you incur over what you would have normally spent to maintain your standard of living if no loss had occurred.

EXCLUSIONS-WHAT IS NOT COVERED:

The policy does not provide coverage for all possible losses. The following are examples of some of the losses that are NOT covered:

  1. Loss or damage that an insured intentionally causes;


  2. Flooding, earth movement, settling, cracking, bulging, shrinking, or expanding of the structure, other structures, or of pavements, driveways, or sidewalks;


  3. Pollution and contamination;


  4. Birds, vermin, or house pets;


  5. Wear and tear.


  1. HOMEOWNERS-PERSONAL LIABILITY



WHAT IS COVERED:

Your policy pays for bodily injury and property damage to another’s property for which you or a member of your household is legally responsible (at fault). This includes the cost of defending you or a member of your household in a liability lawsuit.

EXCLUSIONS-WHAT IS NOT COVERED:

The following are examples of some of the liability exclusions:

  1. Any loss that an insured intends or should expect to happen;


  2. Bodily injury to an insured person or property damage to an insured person’s property;


  3. Damage which results from the ownership or use of an automobile and other types of motorized land vehicles, aircraft, or certain watercraft;


  4. Liability resulting from transmission or exposure of a communicable disease or sexual molestation.


  1. BASIC COVERAGES-RENTER’S AND CONDOMINIUM OWNER’S POLICIES


  1. Renter’s Policy



A renter’s (tenant’s) policy provides coverage for your personal property and for your personal liability in the same way that a homeowners policy does. The general coverages for the causes of loss shown in the attached chart are the same under a renter’s policy, however, the building you live in is not covered. The amount of protection you choose will depend upon the value of the personal property you wish to insure.

  1. Condominium Unit Owner’s Policy



A Condominium Unit Owner’s Policy is similar to a renter’s policy in that it provides coverage for your personal property and personal liability. It differs, however, in that it also provides coverage for building items, including additions and alterations you make to your unit, that are your insurance responsibility under the governing rules of the condominium association. A limited amount of coverage for loss assessments levied on the unit owners by the condominium association is also provided.

III. CANCELLATION, NONRENEWAL, INCREASE IN PREMIUM, AND CHANGES IN COVERAGE

  1. **Cancellation and Nonrenewal**



You may cancel your policy at any time by writing to your company and indicating the date the cancellation is to take effect.

Your company may choose to cancel or nonrenew your policy. If your policy is canceled or nonrenewed, you will receive advance notice. Some examples of reasons for cancellation and nonrenewal include, but are not limited to:

  1. Failure to pay your premium when it is due;
  2. Knowingly making a false statement or a material misrepresentation on your application for your policy;
  3. An unacceptable number of claims;
  4. A substantial change in the use or occupancy of the premises.


  1. **Increase in Premium**



Conditions that may increase your premium include, but are not limited to:

  1. Change of use of your home or premises;


  2. A general rate increase. This results from the loss experience of a large group of policyholders rather than from a loss suffered by an individual policyholder. A general rate increase applies to many persons in the group, not just those who had losses.


  3. Adjustment for inflation. Some companies include inflation coverage in their policies. This coverage can automatically increase the amount of your insurance coverages as inflation pushes up the cost of replacing your home. The increases may be based on a construction cost index and may be reflected in the premium on each renewal date.


  1. **Changes in Coverage**



A number of situations may change the insurance coverage you have. For example, you may choose to change the type of coverage you have, increase or reduce your limits or deductibles, or add optional coverages.

These factors are general in nature and do not represent the only reasons a policy may be changed.

**Please contact your agent or company with any questions about changes in coverage that you wish to make or about changes that your company has made.**

  1. LOWERING YOUR COSTS



Although the general classifications used by insurance companies to set rates may be beyond your control, it is possible to reduce the cost of your homeowners insurance without giving up necessary protection. Here are some tips:

Take the Highest or Broadest Deductible You Can Afford

Insurance should protect you from major losses. Choosing a higher deductible may result in lower premiums.

Check With Your Insurance Agent Before You Buy or Rent a New Home.

Insurance rates are higher for some types of buildings.

Ask If You Are Eligible for Discounts

Some companies may offer discounts for characteristics which make your property subject to less chance of a loss. These may include discounts or credits for a new home, if you have had no recent losses, if you are over a certain age, or if your home has smoke alarms, automatic fire sprinkler systems, and/or burglar alarms.

Compare Coverages, Premiums, and Service When You Shop for Insurance.
