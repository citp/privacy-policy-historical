**HomeServe Group Privacy Notice**

Here at the HomeServe Group we know how important it is to keep your personal data safe, that’s why we’re committed to making sure that you receive the service you’d expect and that your privacy is protected every step of the way.

In this notice you’ll discover exactly what information we collect from you and how we then use this to deliver our services, as well as your rights. It might not be something you’re interested in, but it’s really important you have a read and of course, let us know if you have any questions.

The HomeServe Group ('we' and 'us') means HomeServe plc, together with any entity in which HomeServe plc directly or indirectly has at least a 50% shareholding. HomeServe plc uses a variety of well-known brand and trading names including (but not limited to): HomeServe Membership Ltd, Checkatrade, Help-Link, HomeServe Heating, HomeServe Connect and HomeServe Labs. We may transfer your personal information among the members of the HomeServe Group for the purposes contemplated in this privacy notice.

**So, how do we use your information?**

When you buy a product or service through us, we’ll collect some of your personal details, to make sure you have everything you need to make the most of our services. Please rest assured that we’ll only use this for administering your contract and to support the delivery of the services or products you’ve asked for.

Examples of the types of personal information we usually collect are:

  * Name 
  * Address
  * Telephone number (including mobile)
  * Email address
  * Date of birth
  * Payment details (Direct Debit, credit/debit card number) 
  * Property type (flat, house etc.)
  * Boiler details (make and model) 
  * Any additional requirements such as large print or Braille documentation
  * Details of any additional authorised parties who can manage your requirements on your behalf
  * I.P. address for your device (if visiting our website or using our app)



The information requested during the application process is required to complete the sale of the product on offer and forms part of your contract with us. Unless otherwise stated, the information you provide will never be used for any other purpose without your permission. If any of the data is missing from the application form or is incorrect, we may not be able to process your request.

**Using information provided by third parties**

We sometimes use data from third parties or publicly available sources such as Experian, the edited electoral roll or the deceased preference service. Using this data helps us to ensure that our records are accurate and up to date by filling in any gaps on an address or clarifying vanity addresses and house numbers. It also allows us to remove anyone from our mailings that has passed away.

We also use data for marketing purposes. Any data we use in this way is thoroughly checked by both the supplier and our own internal teams to ensure that the correct marketing permissions are in place and that the data is being used fairly.

**Keeping and storing your data**

If you’re a current or past customer, we’ll keep a copy of your personal details for no longer than 6 years, from the time your active relationship with us ends. Holding on to data allows us to keep accurate records for tax purposes and to handle any future complaints. All other personal data used for prospecting and quotation requests is kept for a maximum of 90 days, unless otherwise required by law.

Some of the data that we collect may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'), for example some of our IT systems are run on servers hosted in the USA. We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable privacy laws.

**Sharing your data with third parties**

We often work with a number of carefully selected third parties, who introduce us to their customers, so we can promote the products and services we offer.

If you’ve been introduced to us through one of our partners, we may share details of the products and services you’ve purchased with them. Sharing data in this way helps us resolve individual complaints and helps us ensure that we’re offering the right products, to the right people.

We respect your privacy and that’s why we don’t give your data to any third parties for marketing purposes. However, on occasion and in addition to the above, we may pass your information to a limited number of third parties for the following reasons:

  * To deliver the services you’ve asked for, which might include giving information to members of your family, household, or other people who have an interest in the property, for instance, landlords or letting agents
  * For legal or regulatory purposes including fraud prevention
  * If we buy or sell any business or company assets



**We’ll always keep you in the loop**

Whenever we collect your personal information we’ll give you the opportunity to let us know how you’d like us to get in touch in the future. We promise not to inundate you with marketing messages, but we also understand if you’d prefer not to receive anything from us.

If you’ve asked us to send you marketing material, you can change your mind at any time by contacting us using the details in the Contact Us section. You’ll also find an unsubscribe link at the bottom of every marketing email we send to you. 

If you’ve given us an email address you may receive messages related to the management of your policy via email, which include policy and renewal documents. If you’d prefer not to receive these messages in this way, just let us know and we’ll be happy to provide them in paper form instead.

**Your rights matter**

If you’d like to see the personal information that we hold about you, you can request a copy any time. If you find that this information is incorrect you can ask for it to be updated. Or, if you believe the information is being processed without a legal basis, you can ask us to stop or request that it’s deleted from our systems.

To action any of the above, send an email to: [Privacy@homeserve.com](mailto:Privacy@homeserve.com) or alternatively you can write to us at:

We won’t ever charge you for a copy of your personal data but we may ask you for proof of your identity before we disclose any information. Once we’ve seen this, we’ll send you a copy of the personal data we hold within 30 days. In addition, if you decide to move away from us for any reason, you can also request for your personal data to be transferred to a new provider on your behalf. 

**Customer profiles**

We carry out something called ‘profiling’ so we can understand the needs, behaviours and socio-demographic characteristics of our customers. This helps us make sure that we‘re offering the right products and services to the right people, for example, not offering gas products to people without a gas supply or products to people living in sheltered accommodation, who don’t need our services. Profiling also means we can tailor our offerings to current customers, enhancing the potential benefits of being a customer.
