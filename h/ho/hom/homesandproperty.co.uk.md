**Privacy Policy**

Data Protection and Privacy   


Your trust is our most important asset. You should be aware that this policy applies only to Associated New Media's ("Associated") web sites and not to the other web sites to which we provide links. If we ask for information about you, we take all possible steps to keep it safe.  


At Associated we are very serious about protecting your privacy. If we ask for information about you, we take all possible steps to keep it safe.  


We may use this information to tell you of changes to the site (and any changes to this policy will be posted here).  


We may also use the information to communicate with you and to let you know about products and services in which you may be interested, from Associated, from other Daily Mail & General Trust companies and from reputable and trustworthy third parties. This will only be done with your consent.  


With your consent, we may supply personal information to third parties. We may also provide them with overall statistics about customers and visitors to our site. The latter will not include information that could personally identify you.  


We reserve the right to access and to disclose personal information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly or to protect either ourselves or our users.   


We guarantee this for all Assocaited web sites - This is Travel, femail.co.uk, This is Money and This is London. This may not be the case for other sites we link to.  


What information do we need?  


1 To provide the services you want, we need to know your interests. We find out by asking you, by reading your comments and by looking at which are the most popular areas of the site. This may involve the use of cookies - small snippets of data stored on your computer by your web browser. Cookies help us deliver a more personal service when you visit us again.   


2 If you enter a contest or promotion we ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can run the contest effectively and tell you if you have won.   


3 If you order a product or services from us, including subscribing to the Subscription Areas, we will need you to input your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number to be forwarded to the couriers who may deliver your order. These details allow us to process your orders efficiently.   


4 If you use our "e-mail a friend" service, we ask for the friend's name and email address. We then send an automatic, one-time e-mail inviting your friend to visit us. Details of this transaction are stored only to send that one-time e-mail or to track complaints of mischievous use. Your friend may email privacy@anm.co.uk to ask that it be deleted.  


5 We use some of the information collected about you to personalise your visits to our web site so that the site appeals to your interests and offers goods or services to you that you may want. We can also use the information to help us develop the design and style of our web site to improve our service to you.   


6 Occasionally, we will use your personal information to inform you about the latest changes to our web site, and products or services that you might find interesting.  


7\. We will send your our newsletter if you have signed up for it. You may unsubscribe at any time using the link provided at the bottom of the newsletter.  


Correcting or updating your information  


Should your personal information change (e.g. your postcode), or if you no longer want services you have signed up for, email privacy@anm.co.uk requesting that we correct, update or remove the data you provided.

If you choose not to receive our cookies, we cannot guarantee that your experience with our web site will be as quick or responsive as if you do receive cookies.
