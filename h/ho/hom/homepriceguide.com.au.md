In this Privacy Policy, **Domain Group** , **us** , **we** or **our** means Domain and its related bodies corporate, partnerships and joint venture entities. Domain Group is the operator of the network (which includes our website and apps) and the data controller for the personal data collected and processed via the network.

This Privacy Policy sets out:

  * what is considered personal information;
  * what personal information we collect and hold;
  * how we collect, hold, use or disclose personal information;

We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth) ( **Privacy Act** ) (subject to exemptions that apply to us under that Act) and any other applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation ( **GDPR** ). However, due to the nature of some of our business activities, from time to time, we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption in the Privacy Act where appropriate. Where we do so, we will ensure that we comply with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards. We may also rely on related bodies corporate, employee records and other exemptions in the Privacy Act. If you require more information on the collection and use of personal information in the course of journalism, please visit the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards at[ www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles](http://www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles?Embed=Y).

We may, from time to time, review and update this Privacy Policy, including taking account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations. All personal information held by us will be governed by the most recent updated Privacy Policy. Your privacy matters to us, so whether you are new to Domain Group or are a long time user, please take the time to get to know our practices.

**What is Personal Information**

When used in this Privacy Policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act or any other applicable data protection law. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include (but is not limited to) your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

**What Personal Information Do We Collect and Hold**

We may collect the following types of personal information;

  * name;
  * mailing or street address;
  * email address;
  * telephone number;
  * age or birth date;

**Cookies**

In some cases we may also collect your personal information through the use of cookies and other tracking devices. When you access our website, we may send a “cookie” (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number) to your computer. This enables us to recognise your computer and greet you each time you visit our website, without bothering you with a request to register or log-in. It also helps us keep track of products or services you view, so that we can send you news about those products or services. We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our websites have been visited, and to measure transaction patterns in the aggregate. We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our online products and services. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them. We may also log IP addresses (the electronic addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer the website, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information.

We may also collect anonymous data (which is not personal information) relating to your activity on our websites (including IP addresses) via cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a survey. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of our products and services. To the extent this information does not constitute personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else, the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.

The provision of your personal data is neither required by a statutory nor a contractual obligation.

We may disclose your personal information to:

  * our employees, related bodies corporate, partnerships, joint venture entities, contractors or external service providers for the operation of our network or our business, fulfilling requests by you, and otherwise provide products and services to you, including without limitation, web hosting providers, IT systems administrators, mailing houses, newsagents, couriers, payment processors, photographic analysers, data entry service providers, electronic network administrators, debt collectors, and professional advisers such as accountants, solicitors, business advisors and consultants;

  * as required or permitted by any law (including the Privacy Act).



**Direct Marketing Materials**

We may send you direct marketing communications and information about products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. These communications may be sent in various forms, including mail, SMS or email, in accordance with applicable marketing laws, such as the _Spam Act 2003_ (Cth). If you indicate a preference for a method of communication, we will endeavour to use that method whenever practical to do so.

In addition, at any time, you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by contacting us (details below) or by using the opt-out facilities provided (e.g.an unsubscribe link), or by updating your personal details on our “MyAccount” webpage. We will then ensure that your name is removed from our mailing list. We do not provide your personal information to other organisations for the purpose of direct marketing unless expressly authorised by you.

If you receive communications from us that you believe have been sent to you other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy, or in breach of any law, please contact us using the details provided below.

**Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information**

You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us (details below). Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try and provide you with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you). We will not charge for simply making a request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information. If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others, or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.

If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.

Members of our websites will generally be able to access and update their membership details online. We request that you keep your information as current as possible so that we may continue to improve our service to you.

**How You can Complain about a Breach of Privacy**

If you believe your privacy has been breached by us, have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy please, contact us using the contact information below and provide details of the incident so that we can investigate it.

We have a formal procedure for investigating and dealing with privacy breaches.

**GDPR**

If the European General Data Protection Regulation ( **GDPR** ) applies in respect of any of the personal information we collect, for the purposes of such applicable data protection laws, we are the controller.

In respect of residents of the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ), references to personal information in this Privacy Policy means any information that (either in isolation or in combination with other information) enables you to be identified directly or indirectly.

In some instances, we may combine other information with personal information. If other information is combined with personal information or is used to build a profile of an individual (in a way which could be reasonably used to identify that individual), the combined information will be treated by us as personal information for so long as it remains combined.

If you are a resident in the EEA, you have the following rights in relation to your personal information (where applicable):

(a)     **Access**. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the personal data. This access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right of access. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing free of charge. For further copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.

(b)    **Rectification**. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to have incomplete or inaccurate personal information that we process about you rectified.

(c)    **Deletion**. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to request that we delete personal information that we process about you, except we are not obliged to do so if we need to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or if other statutory restrictions apply.

(d)    **Restriction**. Depending on the circumstances and as provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where you believe such data to be inaccurate; our processing is unlawful; or that we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose or where other legal grounds to request restriction apply unless we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it or because other statutory restrictions apply.

(e)    **Portability**. Depending on the circumstances and as provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to obtain personal information we hold about you, in a structured, electronic format, and to transmit such data to you or another data controller, where this is (i) personal information which you have provided to us, and (ii) if we are processing that data on the basis of your consent or to perform a contract with you.

(f)     **Objection**. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us and we are required to no longer process your personal data. Such right to object especially applies if we collect and process your personal data for profiling purposes in order to better understand your interests in our products and services or for certain types of direct marketing. If you have a right to object and if you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. You may exercise this right by contacting the Privacy Officer. Such a right to object may, in particular, not exist if the processing of your personal data is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.

(g)    **Withdrawing Consent**. If you have consented to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, free of charge. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal. You can withdraw your consent by sending your request to the Privacy Officer.

You can make a request to exercise any of these rights in relation to your personal information by sending the request to the Privacy Officer on the contact details provided above.

**Metadata**

You may use the website without providing any personal data about you. In this case, we will collect metadata that results from your usage of the website including: browser type and version, operating system and interface, website from which you are visiting us (referrer URL), webpage(s) you are visiting on our website, date and time of accessing our website, and internet protocol (IP) address. The metadata, will be used to improve the quality and services of our website and services by analysing the usage behavior of our users in anonymised form and to prevent fraud, misuse of our IT systems, as well as to ensure physical, IT and network security. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely the proper administration of our website and business.

If you have a complaint and you are based in, or the issue you would like to complain about took place in the EEA, please click[ here](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080) for a list of local data protection authorities in EEA countries.

**Retention**

Your personal data will be retained as long as necessary to provide you with the services and products requested. Once you have deleted your account or otherwise ended your relationship with us, we will remove your personal data from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymise it so that you can no longer be identified from it (unless we need to keep your information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which Domain Group is subject e.g. taxation purposes).

Personal data will in principle be deleted 10 years after the last interaction and business contact between you and Domain Group. However, we will retain your contact details and interests in our products or services for a longer period of time if Domain Group is allowed to send you marketing materials. Also, we typically delete contracts, communications, and business letters, including any personal data contained therein, 10 years after their termination or creation, as such data may be subject to statutory retention requirements, which often require retention of up to 10 years.

We may also retain your personal data after the termination of the contractual relationship if your personal data are necessary to comply with other applicable laws or if we need your personal data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, on a need to know basis only. To the extent possible, we will restrict the processing of your personal data for such limited purposes after the termination of the contractual relationship.

**Security**

We will take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss or unauthorised access, including by means of firewalls, password access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.

If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information, please let us know immediately.

Our website may contain links to other websites operated by third parties. We make no representations or warranties in relation to the privacy practices of any third party website and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of any third party website. Third party websites are responsible for informing you about their own privacy practices.
