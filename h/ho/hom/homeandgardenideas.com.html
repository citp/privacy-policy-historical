If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aggregated and non-personal information.</span> We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our IAC sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.<br><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Third-party websites</span><br><br>
<br><br>
 There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on a link to a retailer or an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How you can access your information:</span><br><br>
<br><br>
 If you have an online account or profile with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.<br><br>
<br><br>
 If you have an online account with us, you also may choose to close your account at any time by contacting us at the address below. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="yourchoicesaboutcollectionanduse"></a>Your choices about collection and use of your information</span><br><br>
<br></p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.</li>
<li>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by unsubscribing from our email programs or contacting us at <a href="mailto:prontocontent@pronto.com" rel="nofollow">prontocontent@pronto.com</a>. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="howweprotectyourpersonalinformation"></a>How we protect your personal information:</span><br><br>
<br><br>
 We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.<br><br>
<br><br>
 We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Children's privacy</span><br><br>
<br><br>
 Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Visiting our websites from outside the United States:</span><br><br>
<br><br>
 This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes to The Writers Network Privacy Policy:</span><br><br>
<br><br>
 We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.<br><br>

<br><br>
 If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set forth above, you have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information with third parties and the IAC companies for their direct marketing purposes. California law gives you the right to send us a request at a designated address to receive the following information:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year</li>
<li>the names and addresses of the third parties that received that information; and</li>
<li>if the nature of the third party's business cannot be determined from their name, examples of the products or services marketed.</li>
</ol>
<p> We may provide this information in a standardized format that is not specific to you. The designated email address for these requests is <a href="mailto:mailto:prontocontent@pronto.com" rel="nofollow">prontocontent@pronto.com</a>.<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies:</span><br><br>
<br><br>
 A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.<br><br>
 For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user ID and the name on your user account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.<br><br>
 You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.<br><br>
 We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" rel="nofollow">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="beacons"></a>Web Beacons:</span><br><br>
<br><br>
 Web beacons (also known as clear GIFs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.<br><br>
<br><br>
 Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.<br></p>
