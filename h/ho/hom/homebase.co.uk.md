We collect and use your information for a variety of reasons. We need some information to enter into and perform our contract – for example your contact and payment details.

We will not delete personal information if relevant to an investigation or a dispute. It will continue to be stored until those issues are fully resolved.

**How long we keep your information**

We will keep your information for as long as it is reasonably necessary. It will depend on factors such as whether you have any outstanding purchases or an account with us or have interacted with recent offers.

There are certain circumstances where we may transfer your personal data to employees, contractors and to other parties.

  * We may share information about you with other members of our group of companies so we can provide the best service across our group. They are bound to keep your information in accordance with this privacy policy.
  * We may also share your information with certain contractors or service providers who assist us in the provision of products and services we supply to you, are involved in prize draws and competitions we run or provide other services to assist with our day to day operations.

We will do this either when we receive your consent or because we need them to see your information to provide products or services to you. These include credit reference agencies, anti-fraud databases, screening agencies and other partners we do business with. 



Your personal information may be transferred to other third party organisations in certain scenarios:

  * If we're discussing selling or transferring part or all of our business – the information may be transferred to prospective purchasers under suitable terms as to confidentiality;

We've listed the rights you have over your information and how you can use them below.

These rights will only apply in certain circumstances. Some of these rights will not be available if there are outstanding contracts between us, if we are required by law to keep the information or if the information is relevant to a legal dispute.

We will normally respond to or action (as applicable) requests within one month from receipt of your request. This period may be extended by 2 further months if necessary taking into account the complexity or number of requests.

It is important that we establish that the individual right is being exercised by the correct person. Therefore, we may need to ask you for information in order to verify your identity prior to processing your request. This may include asking you to confirm certain details we hold about you (such as post code or first line of your address) or to provide proof of identification.

  * Right of access (subject access requests) – the right to request a copy of the personal data (if any) that we have concerning you and supporting information explaining how your personal data is used.

  * Right to restrict processing – the right, in some situations, to request that we do not use the personal data you have provided (e.g. if you believe it to be inaccurate). This is intended as a temporary right until the reason for such restriction has been resolved or rectified.
  * Right to data portability – the right, in some situations, to request that we transmit your data to you or another entity.
  * Right to object - the right to object to certain processing of your personal data (unless we have overriding compelling grounds to continue the processing) and the right to object to direct marketing/profiling In certain circumstances, we will be exempted from responding to certain requests.
