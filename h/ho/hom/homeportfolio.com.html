  <font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size"-1"="">HomePortfolio.com is guided by the principle of Need to Know. We strive to collect only that information we need to complete your request or to serve you better. We need your email address to send you home design news. We need your zip code to locate retailers near you. And we may ask about your specific home design interests, so that we can better tailor offerings for you.<br><br>
  Once you have provided basic information for your Home Design Portfolio (name, email address, and zip code), we keep it in your personal account file so you don't have to re- enter it next time.</font><br>

  <font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size"-1"="">We use your personal information to fulfill your requests and tailor offerings for you. <!-- For example, if you ask for a swatch from one of our manufacturers, we tell the manufacturer where to send it.  -->If you tell us that you prefer a certain style of home design products, we may emphasize that style in our presentation to you.<br> <br>
  When you become a member of HomePortfolio, we also use your personal information to contact you with home design tips or special members-only offers. Occasionally, we may let you know about other companies whose products or services might be of interest. We may also share your personal information if you link to one of our partner sites, so that our partner site can serve you seamlessly.<br><br>
  HomePortfolio will also require a screen name and password if you choose to participate in Talk About, HomePortfolio's online community discussion boards. The screen name you select will be used to identify your online presence in Talk About.<br><br>
  Please be aware that the discussion boards are public venues. If you choose to include personal information in a message or in your author profile, that information will be available to any person viewing or participating in that discussion board. Posting information on public boards may result in unsolicited messages to you and/or the use of such information in a way that is not intended by you.  HomePortfolio's ability to delete or modify information which you provide may be limited by technology or its internal procedures/policies and as such HomePortfolio may not be able to mitigate the consequences of your posting such information in a public forum.<br><br>
  In addition, HomePortfolio may occasionally use portions of a discussion in reference to Talk About for publications and promotions. See </font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size"-1"=""><a href="/AboutUs/terms_doccument.html">Terms of Use</a>.<br><br>
  Your HomePortfolio.com registration will pre-register you with our Portfolio Partner sites. <a href="javascript:popupHomeDesignPortfolio()">Learn about your Home Design Portfolio</a> and how to use it at other sites. Portfolio Partners are clients whose Web sites are powered by HomePortfolio.<br> <br>
  The Personal HomeStyle newsletter is jointly administered by HomePortfolio and Better Homes and Gardens.com (BHG.com).  If you choose to subscribe to this newsletter, the registration information you provide is subject to joint use by both HomePortfolio and BHG.com.<br><br>
  In any case where your personal information is shared outside of HomePortfolio.com, our goal is to have business partners adhere to the same rigorous privacy practices that we do.<br> <br>
  As HomePortfolio develops its business, it might sell or buy assets.  In such transactions, user information may be one of the transferred business assets.  In the event that HomePortfolio Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired or merged with another entity, user information is likely to be one of the transferred assets.

"Required" data is necessary to process your request.<!--  or order. -->  "Optional" data lets us know more about you (tastes and preferences for example) so that we can serve you better.

Aggregate data includes no personally identifiable information. All individual data is anonymous only.

  <font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size"-1"="">HomePortfolio.com does use cookies to identify our registered users. This allows us to recognize you when you enter our site, without asking you to log in every time. A cookie is simply a text file on your hard drive, containing a unique string of characters. The HomePortfolio.com server recognizes your unique string of characters when you visit our site, and is then able to associate your computer with your personal data file on our host computer. That's why we can greet you by name when you visit us again, for example.<br><br>
  If you choose not to use cookies, you can set your browser to refuse them. In that case, we will have to ask you to log in every time you make use of personalized features such as your Portfolio or Retailer Locator.<br><br>
  Sometimes we contract with an outside agency to serve banner ads for HomePortfolio. People who click through the ads to visit HomePortfolio may receive cookies.  In this case, the cookies are used only to gather aggregate data on advertising effectiveness.</font><br>

This is the long number you sometimes see at the end of a URL in your browser. The session ID is randomly generated each time you visit us, and contains no personal information about you at all.  It also lets us know that the same person who looked at mirrors also wants to see lighting fixtures.</font><br>
