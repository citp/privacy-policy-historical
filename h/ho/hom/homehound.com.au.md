## 4 USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

(a) We use Personal Information to supply our services to our customers who use our services to send you communications.

(b) If you provide your name and mobile phone number or email address to our customer or us, you thereby consent to our customer instructing us to using your Personal Information to market our corresponding customer’s services to you, such as by adding you to our customer’s mailing list and notifying you of its promotional offers.

(c) If you provide your IP address or cookies to us or our customers, you thereby also consent to our customer instructing us to use that Personal Information about you to market our customer’s services to you by way of displaying targeted banners or similar. You have control over whether you provide cookies or an IP address. We will not use your Sensitive Information (if any) in relation to direct marketing unless our customer instructs us to and says that it has your consent to do so.

(d) You may withdraw your consent at any time at no cost. All our direct marketing communications include an unsubscribe or other opt-out mechanism. Simply click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of each email or inside the email’s body copy. This will set the status of your email address to ‘Blocked’. Alternatively, contact us and we’ll remove your details manually. You can rejoin the mailing list by retyping your contact details into our Newsletter Sign Up form.

(e) We may also use Personal Information for compiling general information that is not itself Personal Information (General Information). General Information may include aggregated statistical information about your attributes, interests and activities. We may use General Information to, among other things, enable our customers to better understand their customers’ needs and improve their services.

(f) We may also use Personal Information for Legal Reasons.

## 5 DISCLOSURE & TRANSFER OVERSEAS

### 5.1 Disclosure by us

(a) Generally speaking, we will disclose Personal Information only to sub-contractors supplying us with hosting facilities or data management. We do this so that those parties can provide their services to us, enabling us in turn to supply our services to our customers, and in turn, their services to you.

(b) However, please note that we also disclose Personal Information to third party agents such as real estate agents.

(c) We may disclose Personal Information for Legal Reasons.

(d) We may disclose General Information to any person for any commercial purpose.

### 5.2 Disclosure by you

You may have the practical capacity to disclose Personal Information to the general public when using our services, eg posting an online comment or ‘like’ etc. You take full legal and practical responsibility for any such disclosure of Personal Information.

### 5.3 Transfer overseas

We may, and likely will, transfer your Personal Information to a person or organisation in a foreign country, but only if one of the following applies:

  * if we provide the Personal Information to a cloud service provider located overseas for the limited purpose of storing and managing the Personal Information, our contract with the provider: (a) obliges the provider not to use or disclose the Personal Information unless storing and managing the information; (b) obliges any of the provider’s sub-contractors to agree to the same obligations; and (c) gives us effective control of the information;
  * we have taken such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Overseas Compliance);
  * we reasonably believe that the recipient of the information is subject to a law, or binding scheme, that has the effect of protecting the information in a way that, overall, is at least substantially similar to the way in which the APPs protect the information and there are mechanisms that you or the relevant individual can access to take action to enforce that protection of the law or binding scheme;
  * we tell you that Overseas Compliance will not apply and you consent to the transfer; or
  * the disclosure of the information is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court / tribunal order.



## 6 ACCESS

(a) You will be able to access Personal Information about you by contacting us or logging into your account with our relevant customer (if applicable). If we are to provide access to the information, we will do so within a reasonable time.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), we may not grant you access to Personal Information for reasons including:

  * if doing so would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;
  * if the request for access is frivolous or vexatious;
  * giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within Independent Digital Media or one of our customers in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process; or
  * for Legal Reasons or similar reasons.



(c) If we deny you access to Personal Information, we will provide reasons for our decision.

## 7 QUALITY

(a) We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information that we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading (together, satisfactory).

(b) If you believe that the Personal Information we hold is not satisfactory, you may contact us and ask us to correct the information.

(c) If you demonstrate to us that Personal Information held by us is not satisfactory, we will, within a reasonable time, take reasonable steps to correct the information. If you claim that such information is not satisfactory and we disagree, we will notify you of our reasons and, at your request, accompany the information with a note stating your position about the information.

(d) If we correct information that was not satisfactory and we have previously disclosed that information to a third party, we will take reasonable steps to notify that third party.

## 8 STORAGE & SECURITY

(a) We hold your Personal Information on internet servers operated by hosting service providers. We have entered into services agreements with those service providers.

(b) We will take reasonable steps to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

## 9 DISPOSAL

(a) We will take reasonable steps to destroy, disable access to or permanently de-identify Personal Information if we no longer need it for any purpose for which we would be permitted to use or disclose the information under the APPs.

(b) However, characteristics of information storage technology mean that it is not reasonably possible to delete every last remnant of information we have collected.
