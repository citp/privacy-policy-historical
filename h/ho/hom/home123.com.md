Only our employees and authorized service providers who are performing legitimate business functions for Home123.com are permitted to access your personal information. We also use encryption to protect any sensitive personal information that is transmitted or authorized to be transmitted by Home123.com, and we also use electronic firewalls to help prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to your personal data. 

Notwithstanding our efforts, the Internet has inherent security risks.
