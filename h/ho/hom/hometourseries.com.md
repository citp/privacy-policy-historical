The customer profile includes personal information such as your name and address, your telephone number and your email address. The customer profile allows us to facilitate your IKEA shopping experience and to expedite the delivery of purchased products. The IKEA customer profile is optional.

**Website**  
We collect information on our website using transient cookies, sometimes called session cookies. A transient cookie is a small file that contains information about a user, and disappears when the user's browser is closed. Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is not stored on the user’s hard drive; it is stored only in temporary memory that is erased when the web browser is closed. We use transient cookies to determine, for example, how you use our website so we can improve the design of our site. Transient cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information about you. Cookies can be disabled in your web browser.

When you visit our web site, we also collect anonymous information from you. This includes the Internet browser you are using; the computer operating system you are using, time spent visiting the web site, usage patterns within the web site, and the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our site. This information is not matched to your personal information and does not personally identify you. We collect this information to help improve your experience on the web site. Additionally, IKEA may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law or protect our interests and property. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers or government agencies in connection with issues related to fraud or government subpoenas and warrants.

**FREE Hotspot Wireless Internet**  
IKEA USA provides a FREE Hotspot wireless internet Service in our IKEA stores provided by IKEA for use by customers of IKEA. All users are required to log-in individually as an independent user.

**Mobile**  
IKEA offers our customers the ability to find out what’s new at their local IKEA store through their mobile device, either by browsing our mobile web site or through text messaging. Usage of the mobile web site follows similar standards employed by our standard web site; cookies may be employed to remember preferences or previous activity but do not reveal personal information and can be disabled using your mobile device’s Internet options.

To unsubscribe from IKEA Mobile, text the keyword "STOP" to 62345.

**Kid's Ballroom**  
To take advantage of our supervised children’s play area and ballroom while you shop, we require you to fill out a registration card that asks for the child’s name and age, the parent’s or guardian’s name, address, telephone number and signature, and any health concerns relating to the child that we should know. We ask for this information to help ensure the safety and security of the child.

**Other information you provide to us**  
Through surveys, you may provide us with information such as product preferences, reasons for purchasing a product, family and lifestyle information to help us learn more about your shopping preferences. You also may provide such information when you fill out a warranty card about a product you purchased from IKEA. In addition, you may give us such information if you register for or redeem IKEA special offers, discount coupons or other promotions.

We also may ask you to provide us with information about products that interest you and other lifestyle information. We will use such information to learn about your needs and preferences and if you choose to receive further communications from IKEA, to provide you with information about our products services and promotions.

**How may I indicate my privacy preferences?**  
Except as may be required in order to process a transaction, you may choose whether or not to give us your personal information, and if you do, how we use it. If we request your personal information, we will tell you why we are collecting it and seek your consent. Sometimes you will be asked to give your consent expressly (such as by checking a box or clicking on a web page). Other times we may obtain your consent implicitly by asking you to provide information with stated purposes but without any express statement of consent (such as when you order a product or request a catalogue). In other cases, your consent may be implied such as when you respond to a survey when it is understood that we will use the information to learn more about your needs and preferences, or your satisfaction as a customer so as to improve our products and services. In those cases your consent will be understood if you provide us with the requested information. You may notify us at any time that you do not wish us to use your information for any purposes that are not required to complete a transaction by contacting us in any of the ways described at the end of this Notice. You may at any time withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure of your information or request us to delete if from our files, subject to legal and contractual restrictions and requirements related to any transaction.

**How long does IKEA retain my information?**  
We retain your information as long as it is required for the purposes identified when you provided the information for such specific purposes or for any new purposes identified by us and consented to by you, and for any appropriate time thereafter including a sufficient time following to permit you to ask any questions regarding its use. Your contact information which you provide through the customer profile process (described above) is retained until you request us to delete or change it. Information which is created as part of your shopping experience, such as shopping lists, price offers, personal planners and designs, is retained for varying periods up to two years. Certain information is retained for longer periods for our internal audit and quality control purposes.

**Does IKEA share the information it obtains about me with third parties?**  
IKEA does not share personal information about its consumers with any third parties outside the IKEA corporate family for their own marketing purposes. However, we may do so within the IKEA corporate family. We do share this information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf, but these service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. We also may disclose information about you as required by law.  
We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. If the business is transferred, we will provide you with the opportunity to tell us that you would prefer that information about you not be transferred. Should such a transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information about you in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

**How does IKEA protect personal information?**  
The security of personal information is a high priority for us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration and destruction of the personal information in our possession. We are committed to providing appropriate security controls to protect personal information we have about you against foreseeable hazards.

**Does IKEA process my information outside of the U.S.?**  
We may transfer your information outside of the United States for processing and storing.
