**Buchanan Group Privacy Policy.**  
Buchanan Advertising (Australia) Pty Ltd. ACN 155 718 942 (“Buchanan Group”) and the other companies and organisations which make up Buchanan Group are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information.  This Privacy Policy explains how Buchanan Group manages the personal information that we collect, use and disclose and how to contact us if you have any further queries about our management of your personal information.  This Privacy Policy does not cover personal information collected or held by Buchanan Group about its employees.  
**Background**  
Buchanan Group is required by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ( **Privacy Act** ) to comply with ten National Privacy Principles ( **NPPs** ) (subject to the other provisions of that Act).  The NPPs regulate the manner in which personal information is handled throughout its life cycle, from collection to use and disclosure, storage, accessibility and disposal.  Buchanan Group is also required to comply with the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) ( **Spam Act** ) and the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth) ( **Do Not Call Register Act** ).    
**What is personal information?**  
Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion.  Examples include an individual's name, address, contact number and email address.     
Special provisions apply to the collection of personal information which is sensitive information.   This includes health information and information about a persons' race, ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences and criminal history.      
**Collection of personal information by Buchanan Group**  
To the extent required by the Privacy Act:

  * Buchanan Group will not collect personal information about you unless that information is necessary for one or more of our functions or activities. 
  * Buchanan Group will collect personal information only by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive manner.
  * When Buchanan Group collects personal information directly from you, we will take reasonable steps at or before the time of collection to ensure that you are aware of certain key matters, such as the purposes for which we are collecting the information, the organisations (or types of organisations) to which we would normally disclose information of that kind, the fact that you are able to access the information and how to contact us (for example, where personal information is collected on a form, we will generally include a written privacy statement on the form which sets out these details).
  * Buchanan Group will collect your personal information directly from you where it is reasonable and practicable to do so.  Where Buchanan Group collects information about you from a third party, we will still take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the details set out above.



**Use and disclosure of personal information by Buchanan Group**  
If Buchanan Group uses or discloses your personal information for a purpose ( **secondary purpose** ) other the main reason for which it was originally collected ( **primary purpose** ), to the extent required by the Privacy Act, we will ensure that:

  * the secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection (and directly related in the case of sensitive information), and you would reasonably expect that Buchanan Group would use or disclose your information in that way;
  * you have consented to the use or disclosure of your personal information for the secondary purpose;
  * the use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or
  * the use or disclosure is otherwise permitted by the Privacy Act (for example, as a necessary part of an investigation of suspected unlawful activity).



**How might we contact you?**  
We may contact you in a variety of ways, including by post, email, SMS, telephone call or facsimile.  
_Spam_  
We will not send you any commercial electronic messages such as SMSs or emails unless this is permitted by the Spam Act (for example, if we have your express or inferred consent to do so).  Any commercial electronic message that we send will identify Buchanan Group as the sender and will include our contact details.  The message will also provide an unsubscribe facility.  If you do not wish to receive commercial electronic messages from us, please let us know (our contact details are provided at the end of this policy).   
_Do Not Call Register_  
We will not call you on a number listed on the Do Not Call Register unless this is permitted under the Do Not Call Register Act and related instruments (for example, if we have your express or inferred consent to do so).  If you do not wish us to call you on a particular number, please let us know (our contact details are provided at the end of this policy).  
**Data quality and security**  
To the extent required by the Privacy Act, Buchanan Group will take reasonable steps to:

  * make sure that the personal information that we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up to date;
  * protect the personal information that we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure; and
  * destroy or permanently de-identify personal information that is no longer needed for any purpose that is permitted by the Privacy Act.



**Anonymity**  
Buchanan Group will generally provide individuals with the option of not identifying themselves when entering into transactions when it is lawful and practicable to do so.   
**Use of Commonwealth government identifiers**  
Buchanan Group will not use Commonwealth government identifiers ( **Identifiers** ) (such as Medicare numbers) as its own identifier of individuals.  We will only use or disclose Identifiers in the circumstances permitted by the Privacy Act.  
**Transfer of personal information overseas**  
If Buchanan Group transfers your personal information outside Australia, we will comply with requirements of the Privacy Act that relate to transborder data flows.  
**Access and correction of your personal information**  
Please contact Buchanan Group if you would like to access or correct the personal information that we hold about you.  Buchanan Group will generally provide you with access to your personal information (although a fee may be imposed), and will take reasonable steps to amend any personal information that is incorrect.  In some circumstances, Buchanan Group may not permit access to your personal information, or may refuse to correct your personal information, in which case we will provide you with reasons for this decision.  
**Further information**  
Please contact us if you have any queries about the personal information that Buchanan Group holds about you or the way we handle that personal information.  Our contact details for privacy queries are set out below.

In some circumstances, we may collect sensitive information about you (for example, if you post a comment in a forum about your health).  We will not do this unless you have consented to the collection, or if we are otherwise required or authorised to do so by or under law. Sensitive information includes (for example) health information and information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, professional or trade association membership, sexual preferences and criminal record.  
If you do not provide us with the personal information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with some of our products and services (except in cases where we have indicated that the provision of that information is optional). For example, if you do not register as a Member, you will not be able to access pages of this website or other services that are reserved for Members only.  
**Providing us with personal information about others**   
If, at any time, you provide personal information about another person, you warrant that you have made that person aware of this Privacy Statement and the Terms of Use and that you have obtained that person’s consent to provide their personal information to us for the purpose specified.
