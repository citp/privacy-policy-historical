        	<div class="clear"></div><h2></h2>
<p>
	We are serious about protecting the privacy of our users.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy describes how we use and protect your personal data.&nbsp; It applies to <a href="http://www.homeaway.co.uk/">www.homeaway.co.uk</a>&nbsp; and any other websites of our affiliates where this policy is linked to in the footer of the page (each referred to herein as the “Site”).&nbsp; Websites of other of our affiliates may be governed by separate privacy policies and those policies will be accessible by links in the footers of such websites.&nbsp;<br>

	The terms “users” or “you” as used in this <a href="/info/about-us/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, refer to both travellers, who use the Site to look for properties to rent, and members who subscribe to the Site and list their properties for rent.<br>
	<br>

We’re not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites.

	HomeAway complies with the US Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor scheme to cover the transfer of data to the US from the European Union and Switzerland.&nbsp; HomeAway has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.&nbsp; To learn more about this scheme and see the information we have filed with the Department of Commerce here:<br>
	http://export.gov/safeharbor/<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Who processes your personal data, and where?</strong><br>
	Your personal data (also referred to as personal information) - that is, data that identifies you, or from which you are identifiable - will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by companies in the HomeAway group and other data processors acting under our instructions. As a result personal data contributed by or collected from users may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in may be stored and processed in the United Kingdom, United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities.&nbsp; By using our Site, you acknowledge and agree that you may be transferring your personal data outside of the country in which you have contributed it (“your country”), and that you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to those that apply in your country. However, if we transfer your personal data outside of your country in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in compliance with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>The information we gather</strong><br>
	At various times you may give your personal data to us. For example, in order to process a request or enquiry from you, we may need to know all or some of the following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, your current location, and, in the case of a member's listing, a method of payment. You may also give personal data to us at other times, such as when registering on the Site or when submitting an advert for a property. We may also gather information from cookies or web beacons. You can find out more about how they operate in the relevant section of this policy below. We also collect IP addresses, mobile device identifier details, your location, navigation and click-stream data, the time of accessing the website, homes you viewed, what you searched for, the duration of your visit, and other&nbsp; details of your activity on the Site. If you ask us to connect with other sites (for example if you ask us to connect with your Facebook account) we may get information that way too. For further details on how we collect personal data, see Surveys and Newsletters below. We obtain data from you either by you inputting your personal details, by the automatic collection of information about you as you use the Site, when we speak to you, or from third parties. Third party information may include credit information which we use to prevent and detect fraud, information from your mobile provider if you are accessing the Site over a mobile device or information from a third party such as a social media or travel opinions site where you have asked us to share your data with them.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How we use your personal data</strong><br>
	Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to provide you with the services you requested and those which we believe will optimise your use of the Site.&nbsp; You agree that we may use for personal data for the following purposes:<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the services or support you request;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To contact you from time to time with critical user or service updates;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To send other messages that are integral to the service we provide on the Site;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To assist people you have done business with. For example if you are an owner and a traveller who has booked or enquired with you needs your details we may pass them on; if you are a traveller and an owner you have booked with needs to contact you we may give them your details;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote the services related to the Site or those of the HomeAway group and/or our affiliates;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent activity we determine to be potentially illegal, unlawful or harmful and<br>
	to enforce our Privacy Policy and/or our Terms or any other purpose referenced herein or therein. We collate statistics about site traffic, sales and other commercial information which we pass onto third parties to assist us in improving the services we provide to you.&nbsp; We also use demographic information to tailor the Site and we share that information with third parties so that they can build up a better picture of our customer base and general consumer trends.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How We May Disclose Your Personal Data</strong><br>
	We may disclose your personal data to enforce our policies, or where we are permitted to do so by applicable law, such as in response to a valid, legally-compliant request by a law enforcement or governmental authority, or in connection with actual or proposed litigation, or to protect our property, people and other rights or interests.<br>
	<br>
	We may also share your personal data with:<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our partners if&nbsp; you've requested their services or if you’ve requested to be provided with information by them;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another member if you have done business with them<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third party performing services on our behalf;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies in the HomeAway group&nbsp; and/or affiliates; or<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other companies we work with to feature all or part of our member’s property listings or otherwise provide promotional or other services related to our or HomeAway group’s business. This might include featuring your listings and photographs on other websites; or<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any third party you have asked us to share your personal data with – such as Facebook if you have asked us to connect with your Facebook account.<br>
	You may have accessed our website through a hyperlink from the website of one of our trading partners.&nbsp; If so, you consent to your personal details and purchase information, including behavioral patterns, being shared with that trading partner in accordance with our contractual relationship with them.<br>
	<br>
	In the unlikely event that we or HomeAway or any part of the HomeAway group is sold, or some of its assets transferred to a third party, your personal information, as a valuable asset, may also be transferred.&nbsp; Potential purchasers and their advisors may have access to data as part of the sale process.&nbsp; However, use of your personal information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Similarly, your personal information may be passed on to a successor in interest in the unlikely event of a liquidation, bankruptcy or administration. Our customer database could be sold separately from the rest of the business, in whole or in a number of parts.&nbsp; It could be that the purchaser’s business is different from ours too.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Newsletters</strong><br>
	If you sign up as a member of the Site, you will receive our "Owner" newsletter, which is an integral part of the services we provide. Traveller that use the Site will receive our newsletter when they register with us. We and HomeAway group may offer different newsletters from time to time intended to enhance the services we or they offer. Users may cancel their subscription to these newsletters at any time, although it may take a short while for the changes in your preferences to become effective.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<strong>Surveys</strong><br>
	Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our users. From time to time, we request users' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our services.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Games</strong><br>
	From time to time we may run games on the Site. These games may allow for connectivity with other users or third parties. If that is the case you consent to your personal data being transferred accordingly.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Telephone Calls</strong><br>
	As well as collecting data online and from correspondence we may also speak with you face to face (for example at an Owner’s meeting) or by telephone. We frequently record telephone conversations.&nbsp; Those recordings are also governed by this Privacy Policy and we keep this data in the same way that we keep other data. Recordings of calls may also be transferred to locations or processed worldwide.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Enquiries</strong><br>
	Travellers may send enquiries to members via clickable links on the listings on the Site. If you choose to send an enquiry through these links, your personal information, including your email address and any other information you supply, will be visible to the member in question so that they might reply directly to you. If you call the member, you may be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share information in the e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. These enquiries are both sent to the individual member you selected and to our system. The resulting enquiry is available for review only by the member to whom it was initially addressed and to our customer service employees, who may be asked by members for their past enquiry information. While the content of these inquiries is not shared with any other party, we may, from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of the enquiry emails, and analyse the pattern of enquiry usage reported by these third party tracking systems.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?</strong><br>
	We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by the Site reduce our vulnerability to security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each user's responsibility:<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Site;<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure no-one else uses the Site while the user's machine is "logged on" to the Site (including by logging on to your machine through a mobile, Wi-Fi or share access connection you are using);<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To log off or exit from Site when not using it; and<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where relevant, to keep your password or other access information secret. Your password and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access for example over a network; and<br>
	•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To maintain good internet security.&nbsp; For example if your email account or Facebook account is compromised this could allow access to your account with us if you have given us those details and/or permitted access through those accounts. If your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with us.&nbsp; You should keep all of your account details secure.&nbsp; If you think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account does not allow access to your account with us.&nbsp; You should also tell us as soon as you can so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected.<br>
	<br>
	If you have asked us to share data with third party sites, however (such as Facebook) their servers may not be secure.&nbsp; Credit card information is generally stored by our credit card processing partners and we ask them to keep that data secure. We also use third parties to help us optimize our website flow, content and advertising (see below).&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	Note that, despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we engage, the internet is not secure. As a result others may nevertheless unlawfully intercept or access private transmissions or data.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<strong>What are Cookies, Web Beacons and Clear GIFs and Why Do We Use Them?</strong><br>
	A "cookie" is a small file placed on your hard drive by certain of our web pages.&nbsp;&nbsp; We or third parties under contract with us may use cookies to help us analyse our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them here at our Site.<br>
	<br>
	You may delete and block all cookies from this site, but parts of the site will not work. We want to be open about our cookie use.<br>
	Even if you are only browsing the Site certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details and the time of accessing the Site) is automatically collected about you. This information will be collected every time you access the Site and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>
	<br>
	You can reduce the information cookies collect from your device. An easy way of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser.&nbsp; If you do that you should know that (a) your use of the Site may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our, and other, sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.&nbsp; Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will send cookies as soon as you visit our site. By using the site you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.<br>
	We gather and share information concerning the usage of the Site by members and travellers with one or more third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics. In this connection, some of the pages you visit on our Site use electronic images placed in the web page code, called pixel tags (also called a "clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons") that can serve many of the same purposes as cookies. Please <a href="/info/cookies">click here</a> to see the cookies we use when you browse our site.<br>
	<br>
	Web beacons may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow. Our third-party advertising service providers may also use Web Beacons to recognize you when you visit the Site and to help determine how you found the Site.

	<br>
	<strong>Phishing or False emails</strong><br>
	If you receive an unsolicited email that appears to be from us or one of our members that requests personal information (such as your credit card, login, or password), or that asks you to verify or confirm your account or other personal information by clicking on a link, that email was likely to have been sent by someone trying to unlawfully obtain your information, sometimes referred to as a "phisher" or "spoofer." We do not ask for this type of information in an email. Do not provide the information or click on the link. Please contact us at Customer<br>
