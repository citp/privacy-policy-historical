**Other Service:** In the U.S., to serve you better, we may combine the personal information that you give us on our Sites and at our Stores or through our catalogs with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes. 

**Companies that work with or on behalf of The Home Depot:** Some of our operations, such as our call centers, may be managed by unaffiliated companies. Also, if you purchase home services from The Home Depot, these services may not be provided by The Home Depot associates, but rather by reputable local or national companies with which we contract to provide such services. These companies may have access to your personal information on a confidential basis only to the extent necessary to perform their functions. In no event will these companies have the right to use your personal information for any reason other than to provide you with those specific services.  Information provided by you will be used by The Home Depot and its Service Providers to learn about the experiences of our customers so that we may enhance our programs and improve our level of service. 

If your purchases are being shipped to you, we will share your shipping information on a confidential basis with our delivery service providers (U.S. Postal Service, Canada Post, or other delivery companies we or you select). Our delivery service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than making the delivery.

**Additional Information about Our Sites**

**Visiting Our Sites** : In general, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or providing us with any information. However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites. We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites. 

**Cookies:** Our Sites use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our service providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites. 

**Tracer Tags:** Our Sites may also use a technology called "tracer tags". These may also be referred to as "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons". This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Sites. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Sites for you and other future website visitors.

**Online Advertising:** We partner with third-party ad networks to deliver online advertising about our products and services when you visit our Sites or other websites on the Internet. These partnerships help us provide you with advertisements that are tailored to your particular interests, improve and optimize your experience on our Sites, and track the effectiveness of marketing efforts. To facilitate these online advertising efforts, our ad network partners may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about your activities on our Sites or other websites. You can choose not to have your information collected for this purpose. To learn more about online advertising based on this form of information collection, including how you can opt out of such collection, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

**Third Party Links:** Our Sites may include links to the websites of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your prior consent. 

The Home Depot provides links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. The inclusion of any link does not imply The Home Depot's endorsement of any other company, its websites, or its products and/or services. These linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies, which we recommend that you read carefully. We have no control over such websites and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose and otherwise treat your personal information. 

**Security of Personal Information**

We will maintain the confidentiality of all personal information collected in our Stores, our Call Centers, our Sites and from our Service Providers and will only disclose such information to employees and Service Providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Privacy and Security Statement. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control. 

**Security Measures on Our Sites**

**Secure Shopping:** When you place orders on our Sites, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your personal information. 

The Home Depot also takes the following measures to protect your personal information online: 

**Passwords:** To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. The Home Depot will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages). 

**Order Information** : Since any order information you provide to us on our Sites will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Sites. The most recent versions of Netscape Navigator™ and Microsoft Internet Explorer® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively. 

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, The Home Depot cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on our Sites. 

**Who We Are**

The Home Depot is comprised of a family of companies and divisions brought together to provide you with a full suite of home or office improvement products and services.
