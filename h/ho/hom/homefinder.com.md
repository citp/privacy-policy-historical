# HomeFinder.com :: Company :: Privacy Policy

| 

This web site (the " **Site** ") is operated by HomeFinder.com (" **HomeFinder.com** "). The Privacy Policy that follows (the " **Policy** ") describes HomeFinder.com's collection, use and disclosure of information practices in connection with the Site. This Policy applies to the national version of the Site, located at www.HomeFinder.com, as well as to any other versions or pages of the Site that HomeFinder.com operates, including mobile versions and pages that HomeFinder.com co-brands or private labels with its newspaper and broadcast affiliates and other partners (collectively, " **Affiliates** "). For example, you may have arrived at a co-branded version of the Site from an Affiliate's web site, in which case, that Affiliate will be identified at the top of the home page of this Site. In this Policy HomeFinder.com may refer to those versions of the Site as an " **Affiliate Version**." Please be aware that HomeFinder.com may share any information you submit through this Site with Affiliates, as described below. During your visit to any Affiliate Version, the Affiliate may independently collect other information from you. 

This Policy does not describe HomeFinder.com's collection, use, and disclosure of information through means other than this Site (e.g., offline) or the collection, use, and disclosure practices of any third party, including Affiliates. For information on a third party's information collection, use, and disclosure practices, please review the privacy policy on the applicable third party's web site. Also, please note that this Site contains links to other web sites. HomeFinder.com is not responsible for the web sites, content or privacy practices of any third party, including Affiliates. By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree that you are subject to the provisions of this Policy and the HomeFinder.com Terms of Use located at the following URL: [http://www.HomeFinder.com/company/terms](http://www.homefinder.com/company/terms), in each case without modification. If you do not accept any portion of this Policy or the Terms of Use, your only option is not to use the Site.

Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. HomeFinder.com automatically collects Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection with your use of the Site (e.g., the type of property you are looking for, the areas in which you are conducting any property search, etc.). HomeFinder.com collects personally identifiable information on the Site only when you make it available through your use of the Site. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain services on this Site. In addition, you may submit personally identifiable information through the Site in other ways, including: (a) participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes; (b) subscribing to newsletters, editorial content, and/or promotional content sent via email; (c) in connection with other products, services, features, and/or requests made available through the Site; and (d) submission of purchase and/or billing related information including credit card numbers. The types of personally identifiable information collected will depend on the nature of the submission or the features of the Site used, but could include your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. In the event that you purchase an ad in a print/online package through a newspaper Affiliate, the Affiliate is required to share your name, phone number and email address with HomeFinder.com in order to allow HomeFinder.com to process, maintain, and contact you regarding your ad. 

Usage Data Collection

The Site automatically collects passive information and may also customize your visit through technical means, including the following: 

**Cookies** : Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by computers (or servers) to identify your computer.

**Web Beacons** : Web beacons (also known as pixel tags, Internet tags, clear GIFs, or single-pixel GIFs) are electronic images embedded into a web page.

**IP Address Logs** : HomeFinder.com also logs Internet Protocol (IP) addresses — the location of your computer on the Internet.

Cookies allow HomeFinder.com to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address or ZIP code on one of the Site's forms, it may be stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter it again on other forms on the Site. Cookies and web beacons can tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows HomeFinder.com to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and may also be used together to measure the effectiveness of HomeFinder.com advertising campaigns. Cookies, web beacons and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding Site usage (what web site you came from, what pages of the Site you visit, how long you were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what web site did you go to, etc.). Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by HomeFinder.com to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded. You may disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many of the Site's features will not work as well or at all. Anonymous information regarding usage of the Site and services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of HomeFinder.com through the use of such technical means or otherwise is referred to in this Policy as " **Usage Data**."

  * To contact you by e-mail regarding account status, changes to any account agreement, and/or to confirm account registration. In addition, if you provide your email address or other contact information in connection with a request for product information, HomeFinder.com, an advertiser, affiliate, partner and/or other third party or parties, as applicable, may use that information to contact you.

In some cases, the information that you provide through the Site may be collected directly by a third party or its designee (e.g., through forms hosted by such third party or on a page framed with HomeFinder.com branding). Personally identifiable information also may be shared with the specific third parties that can respond to your requests in the form of reporting and other follow-up communications. The subsequent use or disclosure of any information collected by or provided to third parties is subject to their privacy policies and practices.

**Service Providers.** HomeFinder.com may work with related and unrelated third parties that provide services on its behalf. Examples include providers of analytical, developmental, promotional, research, credit card processing, technology, support and other services. For example, HomeFinder.com may work with third parties who host or operate the Site or may ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send newsletters or other email communications on its behalf. Similarly, if you make a payment to HomeFinder.com by credit card, HomeFinder.com may share personally identifiable information and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the credit card processing service provider on HomeFinder.com's behalf. In such cases, HomeFinder.com shall endeavor to require that the third party maintain personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by HomeFinder.com.

**Sweepstakes/Promotions.** In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion on the Site, HomeFinder.com reserves the right to share personally identifiable information collected in conjunction with the sweepstakes, contest or promotion with any third party sponsor or co-sponsor.

HomeFinder.com reserves the right to share any personally identifiable information you post on the Site with third parties. To the extent HomeFinder.com does so, the subsequent use and disclosure of such information is subject to the privacy policies and practices of those third parties. 

Please note that the messages that HomeFinder.com sends to you to confirm, fulfill, or follow up on a request may incidentally include promotional material or other content from HomeFinder.com or its partners. In the case of these messages, HomeFinder.com is not sharing your personally identifiable information with those third parties. HomeFinder.com reserves the right to share Usage Data with Affiliates and any other third party for any reason.

Collection of Information by Third Parties
