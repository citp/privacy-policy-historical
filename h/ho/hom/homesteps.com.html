<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise chartered by Congress to provide a continuous flow of funds for residential mortgages. We achieve our public purpose by purchasing, securitizing and investing in home mortgages, in effect acting as a conduit between the residential mortgage market and the investment community.  As part of our default asset management activities, when there is a default under a residential mortgage in which we have an interest, we sometimes become the owner of the property that secures the mortgage (Property).   In that case, we may seek to sell the Property as part of our risk management activities.  We make this website, homesteps.com (Website), available to facilitate that process.</p>

<p>The policy does not apply to information we receive about or from businesses, other than Website Visitor Information (as defined below). For example, if you are a broker and provide us with contact information (for example, if you want to be included in our online “Find an Agent” directory), this policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us.  The policy also does not apply to information that may be collected by us through any of our other websites, such a <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com">www.FreddieMac.com</a>. Finally, the policy does not apply to information that may be collected by third parties through websites that link to or from this Website.</p>

<p>We may receive personal information about you if you use this Website. We are committed to protecting the privacy of that personal information.</p>

<p>This privacy policy describes the types of personally identifiable information about individuals that we receive from you through the Website (Covered Information) and what we do with the information. The policy also describes how we safeguard Covered Information. We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this section of the Website. When this policy is updated, the date of the update will appear at the bottom of this page.  In addition, a copy of this policy is available upon request by writing to Freddie Mac, Chief Privacy Officer, 8200 Jones Branch Drive, Mailstop 434, McLean, Virginia 22102-3110 or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com">privacy_inquiries@freddiemac.com</a>.</p>
