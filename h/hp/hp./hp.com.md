# HP Online privacy statement

|  HP and its subsidiaries respect your privacy. This Privacy Statement informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. This statement is readily available on our home page and at the bottom of every HP Web page. Some HP Web pages are [P3P-enabled](https://web.archive.org/country/us/en/privacy/p3p_popup.html), which allows you additional control over your personal information. 

HP is a founding sponsor of the Council of Better Business Bureau's [ BBBOnLine](http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/leaving_hp.cgi?cc=us&lang=en&exit_link=http://www.bbbonline.org/&exit_text=Continue%20to%20BBBOnLine%20web%20site&area_text=Online%20privacy%20statement&area_link=http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/privacy.html&back_text=Return%20to%20Online%20privacy%20statement&back_link=http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/privacy.html) Privacy Program for privacy certification.

How HP uses automatic data collection tools:

  * [ Cookies](https://web.archive.org/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html#cookies)
  * [ Web beacons](https://web.archive.org/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html#wb)
  * [Embedded web links](https://web.archive.org/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html#ewl)
  * [HP ads on third party websites](https://web.archive.org/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html#hptpw)
  * [Information gathering tools](https://web.archive.org/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html#igt)



## 1\. Sites covered by this Privacy Statement

  
HP is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. This Privacy Statement applies to all HP-owned websites and domains and the websites and domains of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("HP website"), except that a privacy policy or statement posted on HP websites specific to a particular HP program or service will apply instead of this Privacy Statement. []() 

### Links to non-HP websites

The HP website may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the HP website. HP does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from HP's practices. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. The personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by the HP Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.

## 2\. Collection of personal information 

  
HP collects and uses personal information to understand your needs and interests and to serve you better. 

On some HP websites, we ask you to provide personal information. For example, when you order products or services, apply for instant credit, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register yourself or your HP products, or apply for a job at HP, we will ask you to provide personal information to complete these transactions. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit card information, product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data. If you apply for instant credit, we will ask you to provide additional personal information such as salary, Social Security number and banking information. This information will be used by our financial services providers in determining whether to extend you credit. 

In addition to the information you provide, HP may also collect information during your visit to an HP website through our Automatic Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an HP website. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with HP websites) and product information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers use IP addresses to communicate on the Internet, allowing users to browse and shop. HP also uses some of these Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails sent from HP and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email. To learn more, read [How HP uses automatic data collection tools](https://web.archive.org/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html). 

HP also collects information from commercially available sources that it deems credible. Such information may include your name, address, email address and demographic data. The information HP collects from its commercial sources may be used along with the information HP collects when you visit HP’s websites. For example, HP may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by Automatic Data Collection Tools to derive your general geographic area.  

## 3\. How we use your information

  
The information HP collects to understand your needs and interests helps HP deliver a consistent and personalized experience. For example, HP may use your information to 

  * assist you in completing a transaction or order; 
  * communicate with you about products and services; 
  * provide service and support; 
  * update you on new services and benefits; 
  * provide personalized promotional offers; 
  * select content to be communicated to you; 
  * personalize some HP websites; and 
  * contact you for market research regarding HP products or services. 



We will give you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences regarding the communications we send (see Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences). 

Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. Credit card information and other sensitive personal information required to process a credit decision is not used for any other purpose by our financial services providers or HP and will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain your credit card information for future purchases. 

## 4\. How we share your information

  
HP will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. HP shares personal information with companies working on our behalf and HP-owned business entities. 

HP retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist HP with marketing and communication initiatives. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of HP and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for HP. 

HP participates in marketing initiatives with other companies. As part of these initiatives, certain HP services and marketing communications are delivered at the same time as those from other companies. Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share personal data with both HP and the other companies participating in these initiatives. For example, you may receive marketing communications from HP and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software products from multiple companies. If you choose to provide personal information only to HP, HP will not share this information with the other companies participating in that marketing initiative. Except as described in this Statement, HP will not share the personal information you provide to HP with any third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and properties of HP or its subsidiaries; or (iv) protect the personal safety of HP employees and third parties on HP property. 

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, HP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is HP’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. 

## 5\. Children's privacy

  
HP does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and does not target its websites to children under 13. We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. 

## 6\. Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences

  
HP gives you the choice of receiving a variety of information that complements our products and services. You can subscribe to receive certain product- and service-specific information and also choose to receive HP general communications. We give you a choice regarding delivery of HP general communications by postal mail, email and telephone. 

You can make or change your choices about receiving either subscription or general communications at the data collection point or by using other methods, which are listed in the following sections. This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety warnings, driver updates, or other administrative and transactional notices. 

The email communications that you receive from HP will be provided in accordance with this statement. Some email communications may utilize automatic data collection tools. To learn more, read [How HP uses automatic data collection tools](https://web.archive.org/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html). 

### Subscription communications 

Subscription communications include email newsletters, software updates, etc. that may be expressly requested by you. After you request such communications, you may opt out of receiving them by using one of the following methods: 

  * Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each subscription communication. 
  * Return to the Web page(s) where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions. Access to many HP subscriptions is available at the [Subscriber’s Choice web page](http://www.hp.com/united-states/subscribe/gateway/). 
  * Write to the [HP Privacy Office](http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/privacy/privacy_contact.html). Be sure to provide your name, email and postal address, and specific relevant information about the HP subscriptions that you no longer wish to receive. 



Please be aware that when you opt out of receiving certain subscription communications, it may affect the services you have chosen to receive from HP where accepting the communications is a condition of receiving the services. 

### HP general communications 

HP general communications provide information about products, services, and/or support. This may include new product information, special offers, or invitations to participate in market research. 

You will often be able to use [HP Passport](https://passport2.hp.com/hpp/priprefs.do?s_lang=en&hpappid=privacy) to indicate whether you want to receive general communications from HP. HP Passport is a single-login service that lets you register with HP Passport-enabled websites using a single-user identifier and password of your choice. HP Passport uses cookies to store your basic personal information so you don't have to retype it when you return to one of HP's many websites in the future. HP Passport also allows you to set your privacy preferences. Your preferences will apply across HP websites, email, and other communication vehicles that use HP Passport. If you are unable to use HP Passport, you may opt out of receiving these general communications by using one of the following methods: 

  * Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each communication. 
  * Write to the [HP Privacy Office](http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/privacy/privacy_contact.html). Be sure to provide your name, email and postal address, and specific relevant information about your privacy preferences. 



## 7\. Access to and accuracy of your information

  
HP strives to keep your personal information accurately recorded. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to help maintain data accuracy. HP provides individuals with reasonable access to personal information that they provided to HP and the ability to review and correct it, as applicable. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. To view and change the personal information that you directly provided to HP you can return to the Web page where you originally submitted your data and follow the instructions on that Web page, use [HP Passport](https://passport2.hp.com/hpp/priprefs.do?s_lang=en&hpappid=privacy) where enabled, or contact the [HP Privacy Office](http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/privacy/privacy_contact.html). 

## 8\. Keeping your information secure

  
HP takes seriously the trust you place in us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, HP utilizes appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect. 

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see the symbol of either an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) at the bottom of your browser window. 

Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not used for other purposes. As part of real-time payment processing, HP subscribes to a fraud management service. This service gives you and HP an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud and to protect your financial data.  

## 9\. Changes to this statement

  
HP will undertake reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes to this statement.
