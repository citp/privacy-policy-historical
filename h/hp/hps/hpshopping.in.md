 **Information from third-party sources**

We may also acquire data from third-party sources that we deem to be credible and that are either publicly-available or available on a commercial basis. Such information may include personal data such as your name, address, email address, preferences, interests, and certain demographic data. For example, personal data may be collected when you access our applications through social media logins (e.g., logging in to our applications using your Facebook or other social media credentials). The basic details we receive may depend on your social network account privacy settings. In addition, if you purchase HP Services from an HP partner, we may receive certain information about your purchase from that partner. If applicable, we may also receive information from fraud prevention agencies or from credit reporting agencies in connection with credit determinations.

In order to provide certain HP Services at an enterprise level, your business contact data may be provided to HP by a designated entity within your business or enterprise (such as a member of your IT department). Where necessary, we may also use information provided by you or your employer, together with information from publicly-available and other online and offline sources, to conduct due diligence checks on business contacts as part of our anti-corruption compliance program.

We also receive non-personal data, such as aggregated or de-identified demographic/profile data, from third-party sources such as companies that specialize in providing enterprise data, analytics and software as a service.

In order to ensure data accuracy and offer a superior customer experience by providing you with better personalized services, content, marketing and ads, we may link or combine the information that we collect from the different sources outlined above. For example, we may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by our [Automatic Data Collection Tools](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/privacy/privacy.html?pd9=1#How_We_Use_Automatic_Data_Collection_Tools) to derive your general geographic area. Information may also be linked via a unique identifier such as a cookie or account number.




  * HP does not knowingly collect information from children as defined by local law, and does not target its websites or mobile applications to children.




  * ## How We Keep Your Data Secure

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and to ensure the appropriate use of your information, we utilize reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect and process. HP retains data as required or permitted by law and while the data continues to have a legitimate business purpose.

When collecting, transferring or storing sensitive information such as financial information we use a variety of additional security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When we transmit highly-confidential information (such as credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as later versions of the Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) protocol.

As part of real-time payment processing, we also subscribe to fraud management services. This service provides us with an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud and to protect your financial data.

You can make or change your choices about receiving either subscription or general communications at the data collection point or by using other methods, which are described in the following sections. These options do not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety warnings, driver updates, or other administrative and transactional notices where the primary purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature.

 **Subscription communications**

Subscription communications include email newsletters, software updates, etc. that may be expressly requested by you or which you consented to receive. After you request such communications, you may opt out of receiving them by using one of the following methods:

  

    * Select the email’s “Opt out” or “Unsubscribe” link, or follow the instructions included in each email subscription communication.
    * To unsubscribe from messages delivered to mobile devices, reply to the message with the words “STOP” or “END.”
    * Return to the website(s) where you originally registered your preferences and follow the instructions to opt out. You can access many HP subscriptions at the [Subscriber's Choice website](https://h41369.www4.hp.com/subhub.php?country=US&language=US).

Our general communications provide information about products, services, and/or support. This may include new product or services information, special offers, personalized content, targeted advertising or invitations to participate in market research or compliance reviews.

You will often be able to use [HP Passport](https://hpp12.passport.hp.com/hppcf/modifyuser.do?hpappid=privacy) to indicate whether you want to receive general communications from HP. HP Passport is a single-login service that lets you register with HP Passport-enabled websites using a single-user identifier and password of your choice. HP Passport uses cookies to store your basic personal data so you don't have to retype it when you return to one of HP's many websites in the future. HP Passport also allows you to set your privacy preferences which will apply across HP websites, email, online and other communication vehicles that use HP Passport.

If you are unable to use HP Passport, you may opt out of receiving these general communications by using one of the following methods:

  

    * Select the email’s “Opt out” or “Unsubscribe” link, or follow the instructions included in each email communication.

For more information, please see [How HP Uses Automated Data Collection Tools](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/privacy/privacy.html?pd9=1#How_We_Use_Automatic_Data_Collection_Tools).




  * ## How We Use Automatic Data Collection Tools

We use and allow certain other companies to use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies (collectively “Automatic Data Collection Tools”) on our HP Services.

 **Our use of cookies**

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device, or more technically, to the browser that you use on that device, when you visit a site. The entity that places cookies on your browser can then read the information on that cookie that it set. Cookies are typically classified as either “session cookies” which do not stay on your device after you close your browser or “persistent cookies” which will usually remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.

Different cookies are used to perform different functions which we explain below:

    *  **We use cookies that are essential:** Some cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our websites and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, we cannot enable appropriate content based on the type of device you are using.
    *  **We use cookies to remember your selections:** These cookies allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
    *  **We use cookies to personalize your experience:** We also use cookies to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These cookies may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, a cookie helps our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link cookies together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of cookies, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them.
    *  **We use cookies for performance and analytics purposes:** We use our own cookies and/or third-party cookies and other identifiers (such as Web Beacons) to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, cookies and web beacons may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use Google Analytics, run by Google Inc., for example, to track website usage and activity.   
The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our cookies or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites.
    *  **We use cookies for targeted advertising purposes:** We also allow data providers to use cookies or other Automatic Data Collection Tools on HP Services to help us deliver our own content and advertising, and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address) that we may share with data providers solely in hashed, non-human readable form. If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. You can opt out of receiving interest based advertising on our website by blocking these cookies as described in [Your Choices Regarding Automatic Data Collection Tools](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/privacy/privacy.html?pd10=1#Your_Choices_Regarding_Automatic_Data_Collection_Online_Tracking). Please also read below about advertising cookies used by third parties.

 **Third party advertising cookies and social media cookies**  


We do allow advertisers and other third parties (such as select retail partners) to place cookies on our websites to allow them to show you advertisements both on and off HP websites that are more relevant and useful to you. We may use remarketing tags (e.g., Google and Bluekai) to allow our retail partners to advertise products which you have browsed on our site. However, we do not share any information with these advertisers and third parties that will directly identify you. These advertisers and other third parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards.

You can find out more about some of our interest based advertising partners by visiting these websites:

    * <https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/>
    * <http://www.oracle.com/us/legal/privacy/marketing-cloud-data-cloud-privacy-policy/index.html>
    * <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/>

Please note that the above is not an exhaustive list and may be updated by us from time to time.

 **Sharing other information with advertisers**

We may also transfer information about you to ad technology providers so that they may recognize your devices and deliver interest based content and advertisements to you. The information may include your name, postal address, email, device ID, or other identifier in encrypted form. The providers may process the information in hashed or de-identified form. These providers may collect additional information from you, such as your IP address and information about your browser or operating system; may combine information about you with information from other companies in data sharing cooperatives in which we participate; and may place or recognize their own unique cookie on your browser. These cookies may contain demographic or other data in de-identified form.

Cookies may also be used when you share information using a social media sharing button on the websites. The social network will record that you have done this. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities. The types of cookies used by these third parties and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies’ privacy policies. For information on how to opt out of targeting advertising, please see the above websites for more detail or go to [Your Choices Regarding Automatic Data Collection & Online Tracking](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/privacy/privacy.html?pd10=1#Your_Choices_Regarding_Automatic_Data_Collection_Online_Tracking).

 **Other automatic data collection tools**

 **Web Beacons**  
We may use and permit select third parties to use web beacons (usually in combination with cookies) to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email or other communications, to measure performance and to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you. A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIFs) is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the date and time when you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. For instance, we may include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether our messages have been opened or acted upon and whether our mailing tools are working correctly.

 **Embedded Web links**  
Emails from HP, Internet keyboard keys preconfigured by HP, and promotional icons preinstalled on your PC desktop often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the web, after redirection through HP’s servers. The redirection system allows HP to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives. In emails, such web links may also allow HP to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and this information about the interaction may be connected to your personal identity.

To learn more about your advertising choices if you are in the US, please [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or in Canada please [click here](http://www.youradchoices.ca/). In the US, the Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt out of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) to learn more. Note that opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.

Some newer web browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features. Currently, no industry standard exists for handling “Do Not Track” requests, therefore at this time, our websites may not respond to “Do Not Track” requests or headers from these browsers.

 **If you have queries about our use of cookies, you can contact the[HP Privacy Office](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/privacy/ww-privacy-form.html).**

 ** **Web beacons****

Because web beacons are the same as any other content request included in the recipe for a web page, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, you may be able to disable web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in messages you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other Automatic Data Collection Tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities. For more information about this, please refer to the information provided by your email software or service provider. Web beacons may also be rendered ineffective in some circumstances by opting out of cookies or amending your cookie settings in your browser.

 **Embedded web links**

If you do not want us to collect information about the links that you click, you can:

    * Change your choice about how you receive communications from us (i.e., choose a text-based version of the message where available) or choose not to click links in emails that we send;
    * Delete the promotional icons preinstalled by HP on your PC desktop or choose not to click on those;
    * Reconfigure the Internet keyboard keys on certain PC models to launch a destination URL of your choice by using the instructions provided with your PC.




  * ## Exercising Your Rights & Contacting Us

You have the right to access any personal data that you have provided to us or that we maintain about you. In addition, you have the right to withdraw any consent previously granted or to request correction, amendment, restriction, anonymization or deletion of your personal data and to request an explanation about the processing. In certain cases, your request may be denied on the basis of a legitimate exception such as where making information available would reveal personal data about another person or where we are legally prevented from disclosing such information.
