Please review it carefully. <p></p><p>Respect for our patients' privacy has long been highly valued at Hospital for Special Surgery. Not only is it what our patients expect, it is the right way to conduct health care. As required by law, we will protect the privacy of health information that may reveal your identity and provide you with a copy of our notice which describes the health information privacy practices of our Hospital and its medical staff and affiliated health care providers when providing health care services for our Hospital. Our notice will be posted in our main entrance area and in other locations at the Hospital. You will also be able to obtain your own copy by accessing our website at <a target="_Blank" href="redirect.aspx?Link=http://www.hss.edu/">www.hss.edu</a>, calling Health Information Management at 212.606.1254, or asking for one at the time of your next visit. </p><p>If you have any questions about this notice or would like further information, please contact the Privacy Officer at 212.774.7500.</p><h2 class="heading"><a class="nameAnchor" name="Who_Will_Follow_The_Practices_In_This_Notice"></a>Who Will Follow The Practices In This Notice?</h2><p>Hospital for Special Surgery provides health care to our patients together with physicians and other health care professionals and organizations. The privacy practices described in this notice will be followed by:</p><ul><li>Any health care professional who provides direct hospital services to treat you at any of our Hospital locations; </li><li>All employees, medical staff, trainees, students, and volunteers at any of our locations that provide direct hospital services; </li></ul><p>The privacy practices described in this notice do not apply when care is being provided to you in the private offices of medical staff or other health care professionals, even if these offices are located on Hospital premises. For example, if you are being treated by a doctor on our medical staff while you are an inpatient in the Hospital, or being treated at an outpatient clinic of the Hospital, the privacy practices described in this notice will apply. If you are seen by the same doctor for a follow-up appointment at his private office, whether located at the Hospital or outside of the Hospital, the privacy practices in this notice will not apply. The doctor should provide you with a separate notice explaining the privacy practices that will apply to his or her private office. In addition, the privacy practices described in this notice do not apply to members of our medical staff or other members of our workforce when they treat you at other hospitals or facilities. </p><h2 class="heading"><a class="nameAnchor" name="Permissions_Described_In_This_Notice"></a>Permissions Described In This Notice</h2><p>This notice will explain the different types of permission we will obtain from you before we use or disclose your health information for certain purposes. The three types of permissions referred to in this notice are:</p><ul><li>A "<b>general written consent</b>," which we will obtain from you in order to use and disclose your health information in order to treat you, obtain payment for that treatment, and conduct our business operations. We will obtain this general written consent the first time we provide you with treatment or services. This general written consent is a broad permission that does not have to be repeated each time we provide treatment or services to you. </li><li>An "<b>opportunity to object</b>," which we will provide to you before we may use or disclose your health information for certain purposes. In these situations, you will have an opportunity to object to the use or disclosure of your health information in person, over the phone, or in writing. </li><li>A "<b>written authorization</b>," which will provide you with detailed information about who may receive your health information for certain specific purposes. We will only be permitted to use and disclose your health information described on the written authorization in the ways that are explained on the written authorization form you have signed. A written authorization will have an expiration date or event.</li></ul><p><a href="About/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices#top">Back to Top</a></p><h2 class="heading"><a class="nameAnchor" name="Important_Summary_Information"></a>Important Summary Information</h2><p><strong>Requirement for Written Authorization.</strong> We will generally obtain your <a href="javascript:viewFile('info','About','HSS_Authorization_Form.pdf');">written authorization</a> before using your health information or sharing it with others outside the Hospital. You may also initiate the transfer of your records to another person by completing a written authorization form. If you provide us with written authorization, you may revoke that written authorization at any time, except to the extent that we have already relied upon it. To revoke a written authorization, please write to the Hospital's Health Information Management office.</p><p><strong>Exceptions to Written Authorization Requirement.</strong> There are some situations when we do not need your written authorization before using your health information or sharing it with others. They are:</p><ul><li><strong>For Treatment, Payment, and Business Operations.</strong> We will only obtain your general written consent one time to use and disclose your health information to treat your condition, collect payment for that treatment, and run our business operations. In some cases, we also may disclose your health information to another health care provider or payor for its payment activities and certain of its business operations. </li><li><strong>For Patient Directory and Disclosure to Family and Friends Involved In Your Care.</strong> If you do not object, when you are admitted we will include information about you in our Patient Directory and share information about your location and condition with your friends and family involved in your care. </li><li><strong>In Emergencies or Public Need.</strong> We may use or disclose your health information in an emergency or for important public health needs. For example, we may share your information with public health officials at the New York State or City health departments who are authorized to investigate and control the spread of diseases. </li><li><strong>If Information Is Completely or Partially De-Identified.</strong> We may use or disclose your health information if we have removed any information that might identify you so that the health information is "completely de-identified." We may also use and disclose "partially de-identified" information if the person who will receive the information agrees in writing to protect the privacy of the information.</li></ul><p><strong>How to Access Your Health Information.</strong> You generally have the right to inspect and copy your health information.</p><p><strong>How to Correct Your Health Information.</strong> You have the right to request that we amend your health information if you believe it is inaccurate or incomplete.</p><p><strong>How to Identify Others Who Have Received Your Health Information.</strong> You have the right to receive an "accounting of disclosures," which identifies certain persons or organizations to which we have disclosed your health information in accordance with the protections described in this Notice of Privacy Practices. Many routine disclosures we make will not be included in this accounting, but the accounting will identify certain non-routine disclosures of your information.</p><p><strong>How to Request Additional Privacy Protections.</strong> You have the right to request further restrictions on the way we use your health information or share it with others. We are not required to agree to the restriction you request, but if we do, we will be bound by our agreement.</p><p><strong>How to Request More Confidential Communications.</strong> You have the right to request that we contact you in a way that is more confidential for you, such as at home instead of at work. We will try to accommodate all reasonable requests.</p><p><strong>How Someone May Act On Your Behalf.</strong> You have the right to name a personal representative who may act on your behalf to control the privacy of your health information. Parents and guardians will generally have the right to control the privacy of health information about minors unless the minors are permitted by law to act on their own behalf.</p><p><strong>How to Learn About Special Protections for HIV, Alcohol, and Substance Abuse, Mental Health, and Genetic Information.</strong> Special privacy protections apply to HIV-related information, alcohol and substance abuse treatment information, mental health information, and genetic information. Some parts of this general Notice of Privacy Practices may not apply to these types of information. If your treatment involves this information, you will be provided with special authorization forms in connection with the disclosure of such information by the Hospital. To request copies of these forms, please contact Health Information Management at (212) 606-1254.</p><p><strong>How to Obtain a Copy of This Notice.</strong> You have the right to a paper copy of this notice. You may request a paper copy at any time, even if you have previously agreed to receive this notice electronically. To do so, please call Health Information Management at (212) 606-1254. You may also obtain a copy of this notice from our website at <a target="_Blank" href="redirect.aspx?Link=http://www.hss.edu/">www.hss.edu</a> or by requesting a copy at your next visit.</p><p><strong>How to Obtain a Copy of Revised Notice.</strong> We may change our privacy practices from time to time. If we do, we will revise this notice so you will have an accurate summary of our practices, and the revised notice will apply to all of your health information. We will post any revised notice in our admitting areas and other locations in the Hospital. You will also be able to obtain your own copy of the revised notice by accessing our website at <a target="_Blank" href="redirect.aspx?Link=http://www.hss.edu/">www.hss.edu</a>, calling our Health Information Management office at (212) 606-1254, or asking for one at the time of your next visit. The effective date of the notice will always be noted in the cover and at the top outside corner of the each page. We are required to abide by the terms of the notice that is currently in effect.</p><p><strong>How to File a Complaint.</strong> If you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you may file a complaint with us or with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. To file a complaint with us, please contact the Privacy Officer at (212) 774-7500 or send a letter to the Hospital to the attention of the Privacy Officer. No one will retaliate or take action against you for filing a complaint.</p><p><a href="About/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices#top">Back to Top</a></p><h2 class="heading"><a class="nameAnchor" name="What_Health_Information_Is_Protected"></a>What Health Information Is Protected</h2><p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of information we gather about you while providing health-related services. Some examples of protected health information are: </p><ul><li>information indicating that you are a patient at the Hospital or receiving treatment or other health-related services from our Hospital; </li><li>information about your health condition (such as a disease you may have); </li><li>information about health care products or services you have received or may receive in the future (such as an operation); or </li><li>information about your health care benefits under an insurance plan (such as whether a prescription is covered); </li></ul><p>when combined with:</p><ul><li>demographic information (such as your name, address, or insurance status); </li><li>unique numbers that may identify you (such as your social security number, your phone number, or your driver's license number); and </li><li>other types of information that may identify who you are.</li></ul><h2 class="heading"><a class="nameAnchor" name="How_We_May_Use_And_Disclose_Your_Health_Information"></a>How We May Use And Disclose Your Health Information</h2><p><strong>1. Treatment, Payment, and Business Operations</strong></p><p>With your general written consent, we may use your health information or share it with others in order to treat your condition, obtain payment for that treatment, and run our business operations. In some cases, we may also disclose your health information for payment activities and certain business operations of another health care provider or payor.</p><p><strong>Treatment.</strong> We may share your health information with doctors, nurses and other health care providers at the Hospital who are involved in taking care of you, and they may in turn use that information to diagnose or treat you. A doctor at our Hospital may share your health information with another doctor inside our Hospital, or with a doctor at another hospital, to determine how to diagnose or treat you. Your doctor may also share your health information with another doctor to whom you have been referred for further health care.</p><p><strong>Payment.</strong> We may use your health information or share it with others so that we may obtain payment for your health care services. For example, we may share information about you with your health insurance company in order to obtain reimbursement after we have treated you, or to determine whether it will cover your treatment. We might also need to inform your health insurance company about your health condition in order to obtain pre-approval for your treatment, such as admitting you to the Hospital for a particular type of surgery. Finally, we may share your information with other health care providers and payors for their payment activities.</p><p><strong>Business Operations.</strong> We may use your health information or share it with others in order to conduct our business operations. For example, we may use your health information to evaluate the performance of our staff in caring for you, or to educate our staff on how to improve the care they provide. Finally, we may share your health information with other health care providers and payors for certain of their business operations if the information is related to a relationship the provider or payor currently has or previously had with you, and if the provider or payor is required by federal law to protect the privacy of your health information. </p><p><strong>Appointment Reminders, Treatment Alternatives, Benefits, and Services.</strong> In the course of providing treatment to you, we may use your health information to contact you with a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or services at our facility. We may also use your health information in order to recommend possible treatment alternatives or health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.</p><p><strong>Fundraising.</strong> To support our business operations, we may use demographic information about you, including information about your age and gender, where you live or work, and the dates that you received treatment, in order to contact you to raise money to help us further our missions of patient care, research, and education. We may also share this information with a charitable foundation that will contact you to raise money on our behalf.</p><p><strong>Business Associates.</strong> We may disclose your health information to contractors, agents and other business associates who need the information in order to assist us with obtaining payment or carrying out our business operations. For example, we may share your health information with a billing company that helps us to obtain payment from your insurance company. Another example is that we may share your health information with an accounting firm or law firm that provides professional advice to us about how to improve our health care services and comply with the law. If we do disclose your health information to a business associate, we will have a written contract that requires our business associate to protect the privacy of your health information.</p><p>We can do all of these things if you have signed a general written consent form. Once you sign this general written consent form, it will be in effect indefinitely until you revoke your general written consent. You may revoke your general written consent at any time, except to the extent that we have already relied upon it. For example, if we provide you with treatment before you revoke your general written consent, we may still share your health information with your insurance company in order to obtain payment for that treatment. To revoke your general written consent, please write to Health Information Management at 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. </p><p><strong>2. Patient Directory/Family and Friends</strong></p><p>We may use your health information in, and disclose it from, our Patient Directory, or share it with family and friends involved in your care, without your written authorization. You may object to these uses and disclosures of your health information unless there is insufficient time because of a medical emergency (in which case we will discuss your preferences with you as soon as the emergency is over). We will follow your wishes unless we are required by law to do otherwise.</p><p><strong>Patient Directory.</strong> If you do not object, we will include your name, your location in our facility, your general condition (e.g., fair, stable, critical, etc.) and your religious affiliation in our Patient Directory while you are a patient in the Hospital. This directory information, except for your religious affiliation, may be released to people who ask for you by name. Your religious affiliation may be given to a member of the clergy, such as a priest or rabbi, even if he or she doesn't ask for you by name.</p><p><strong>Family and Friends Involved In Your Care.</strong> If you do not object, we may share your health information with a family member, relative, or close personal friend who is involved in your care or payment for that care. We may also notify a family member, personal representative, or another person responsible for your care about your location and general condition here at the Hospital. In some cases, we may need to share your information with a disaster relief organization that will help us notify these persons.</p><p><strong>3. Emergencies or Public Need</strong></p><p>We may use your health information, and share it with others, in order to treat you in an emergency or to meet important public needs. We will not be required to obtain your general written consent before using or disclosing your information for these reasons. We will, however, obtain your written authorization for, or provide you with an opportunity to object to, the use and disclosure of your health information in these situations when state law specifically requires that we do so.</p><p><strong>Emergencies.</strong> We may use or disclose your health information if you need emergency treatment or if we are required by law to treat you but are unable to obtain your general written consent. If this happens, we will try to obtain your general written consent as soon as we reasonably can after we treat you.</p><p><strong>Communication Barriers.</strong> We may use and disclose your health information if we are unable to obtain your general written consent because of substantial communication barriers, and we believe you would want us to treat you if we could communicate with you. </p><p><strong>As Required By Law.</strong> We may use or disclose your health information if we are required by law to do so. We will notify you of these uses and disclosures if notice is required by law.</p><p><strong>Public Health Activities.</strong> We may disclose your health information to authorized public health officials (or a foreign government agency collaborating with such officials) so they may carry out their public health activities. For example, we may share your health information with government officials that are responsible for controlling disease, injury, or disability. We may also disclose your health information to a person who may have been exposed to a communicable disease or be at risk for contracting or spreading the disease if the law requires or permits us to do so. And finally, we may release some health information about you to your employer if your employer hires us to provide you with a physical exam and we discover that you have a work-related injury or disease that your employer must know about in order to comply with employment laws. </p><p><strong>Victims of Abuse, Neglect, or Domestic Violence.</strong> We may release your health information to a public health authority that is authorized to receive reports of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.

These rights are important because they will help you make sure that the health information we have about you is accurate. They may also help you control the way we use your information and share it with others, or the way we communicate with you about your medical matters.</p><p><strong>1. Right To Inspect And Copy Records</strong></p><p>You have the right to inspect and obtain a copy of any of your health information that may be used to make decisions about you and your treatment for as long as we maintain this information in our records. This includes medical and billing records. To inspect or obtain a copy of your health information, please submit your request in writing to Health Information Management, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. If you request a copy of the information, we may charge a fee for the costs of copying, mailing, or other supplies we use to fulfill your request. The standard fee is $0.75 per page and must generally be paid before or at the time we give the copies to you.</p><p>We will respond to your request for inspection of records within 10 days. We ordinarily will respond to requests for copies within 30 days if the information is located in our facility and within 60 days if it is located off-site at another facility. If we need additional time to respond to a request for copies, we will notify you in writing within the time frame above to explain the reason for the delay and when you can expect to have a final answer to your request.</p><p>Under certain very limited circumstances, we may deny your request to inspect or obtain a copy of your information. If we do, we may provide you with a summary of the information instead. We will also provide a written notice that explains our reasons for providing only a summary, and a complete description of your rights to have that decision reviewed and how you can exercise those rights. The notice will also include information on how to file a complaint about these issues with us or with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. If we have reason to deny only part of your request, we will provide complete access to the remaining parts after excluding the information we will not let you inspect or copy.</p><p><strong>2. Right To Amend Records</strong></p><p>If you believe that the health information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to amend the information. You have the right to request an amendment for as long as the information is kept in our records. To request an amendment, please write to Health Information Management, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. Your request should include the reasons why you think we should make the amendment. Ordinarily we will respond to your request within 60 days. If we need additional time to respond, we will notify you in writing within 60 days to explain the reason for the delay and when you can expect to have a final answer to your request.</p><p>If we deny part or all of your request, we will provide a written notice that explains our reasons for doing so. You will have the right to have certain information related to your requested amendment included in your records. For example, if you disagree with our decision, you will have an opportunity to submit a statement explaining your disagreement which we will include in your records. We will also provide you with information on how to file a complaint with us or with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. These procedures will be explained in more detail in any written denial notice we send you.</p><p><strong>3. Right To An Accounting Of Disclosures</strong></p><p>After April 14, 2003, you have a right to request an "accounting of disclosures" which identifies certain other persons or organizations to whom we have disclosed your health information in accordance with applicable law and the protections afforded in this Notice of Privacy Practices. An accounting of disclosures does not describe the ways that your health information has been shared within the Hospital as long as all other protections described in this Notice of Privacy Practices have been followed (such as obtaining the required approvals before sharing your health information with our doctors for research purposes).</p><p>An accounting of disclosures also does not include information about the following disclosures:</p><ol><li>Disclosures we made to you or your personal representative; </li><li>Disclosures we made pursuant to your written authorization; </li><li>Disclosures we made for treatment, payment or business operations; </li><li>Disclosures made from the patient directory; </li><li>Disclosures made to your friends and family involved in your care or payment for your care; </li><li>Disclosures that were incidental to permissible uses and disclosures of your health information (for example, when information is overheard by another patient passing by); </li><li>Disclosures for purposes of research, public health or our business operations of limited portions of your health information that do not directly identify you; </li><li>Disclosures made to federal officials for national security and intelligence activities; </li><li>Disclosures about inmates to correctional institutions or law enforcement officers; </li><li>Disclosures made before April 14, 2003. </li></ol><p>To request an accounting of disclosures, please write to Health Information Management at 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. Your request must state a time period within the past six years (but not before April 14, 2003) for the disclosures you want us to include. For example, you may request a list of the disclosures that we made between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005. You have a right to receive one accounting within every 12 month period for free. However, we may charge you for the cost of providing any additional accounting in that same 12 month period. We will always notify you of any cost involved so that you may choose to withdraw or modify your request before any costs are incurred.</p><p>Ordinarily we will respond to your request for an accounting within 60 days. If we need additional time to prepare the accounting you have requested, we will notify you in writing about the reason for the delay and the date when you can expect to receive the accounting. In rare cases, we may have to delay providing you with the accounting without notifying you because a law enforcement official or government agency has asked us to do so.</p><p><strong>4. Right To Request Additional Privacy Protections</strong></p><p>You have the right to request that we further restrict the way we use and disclose your health information to treat your condition, collect payment for that treatment, or run our business operations. You may also request that we limit how we disclose information about you to family or friends involved in your care. For example, you could request that we not disclose information about a surgery you had. To request restrictions, please write to Health Information Management, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. Your request should include (1) what information you want to limit; (2) whether you want to limit how we use the information, how we share it with others, or both; and (3) to whom you want the limits to apply. </p><p>We are not required to agree to your request for a restriction, and in some cases the restriction you request may not be permitted under law. However, if we do agree, we will be bound by our agreement unless the information is needed to provide you with emergency treatment or comply with the law. Once we have agreed to a restriction, you have the right to revoke the restriction at any time. Under some circumstances, we will also have the right to revoke the restriction as long as we notify you before doing so; in other cases, we will need your permission before we can revoke the restriction.</p><p><strong>5. Right To Request Confidential Communications</strong></p><p>You have the right to request that we communicate with you about your medical matters in a more confidential way by requesting that we communicate with you by alternative means or at alternative locations. For example, you may ask that we contact you at home instead of at work. To request more confidential communications, please write to Health Information Management, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. We will not ask you the reason for your request, and we will try to accommodate all reasonable requests. Please specify in your request how or where you wish to be contacted, and how payment for your health care will be handled if we communicate with you through this alternative method or location.</p><p><a href="About/Notice-of-Privacy-Practices#top">Back to Top</a></p><p><br><em>Last Updated March 26, 2003</em></p><div id="divSpacer"></div></div><!-- Creates the gradient top/bottom left/right borders --><div id="TopLeftBorder"><img src="http://www.hss.edu/Images/Other/lineTop.gif" alt=""></div><div id="BottomLeftBorder"><img src="http://www.hss.edu/Images/Other/lineBottom.gif" alt=""></div></div><div class="clear"></div></div><!-- 3 --></div><!-- 2 -->
