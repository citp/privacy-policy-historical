As technologies evolve rapidly, we reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any time. Any such changes to our Policy will be posted promptly on this page. We will update the “Last Updated” date to reflect the effective date of the changes.

**What Types of Information Do We Collect?**To the top ↑

The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information (e.g., your name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.) that you voluntarily supply when you register, initiate transactions, or communicate with us; and (2) information collected automatically when you navigate our Services or read our e-mail newsletters. In some cases, a vendor or service provider of ours collects information on our behalf. Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our Services may also gather information through processes that we do not control. As such, collection of such information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policies.

  


**Registration and Other Personal Information**

When we use the term “Personal Information” in this Policy, we are referring only to information that uniquely identifies a specific individual such as the individual’s name, phone number, mailing address, or e-mail address. It may also be information about an individual’s online activity. 

We may ask you for Personal Information when you register for or use various aspects of our Services, including when you order products or services, complete a survey, enter a contest, or report a problem with our Services. We may also collect contact information about other individuals when you use the ‘sharing’ tools available within our Services to share content or offers with your friends and associates. As such, please note that if you use any “send-to-friend” features of our Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

  


**Aggregated Information**

Much of the information we collect is compiled into aggregated statistics, such as traffic generated by visits onto various pages or the surfing habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated information does not include any information that would specifically identify you and does not constitute “Personal Information” under the Policy. Such information is often used to diagnose and resolve server problems, analyze trends, and improve our products, services, and offerings. As such, we may disclose Aggregated Information or other similar data and metrics to third parties as we see fit.

**Information We Collect Automatically When You Use Our Services   **

We may collect certain information automatically when you use our Services, including: 

  * Your browser type, browser identifiers, language, plug-ins, Internet domain, and operating system;
  * Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that other computers connected to the Internet can communicate with you online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;
  * The site you visited before visiting our Services and the site you visit after leaving our Services;
  * Content and advertisements you view and links you click on while navigating within our Services;
  * Unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law;
  * Information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies;
  * Information about your interactions with our video content, such as the type of content viewed using our Services;
  *  Information about your interactions with our e-mail messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message; and
  * Standard server log information.

  


**Precise Location-Based Information**

With your consent, we also may also collect information about the real-time location of mobile devices you use to access our Services. We use this information to provide you with content and location services you request, such as location-based weather reports and traffic maps. We may also make location-based offers that might interest you, enable you to submit user-generated content based on your location, and otherwise improve your experience using our Services. To use our Services, you are not required to consent to the collection of location-based information and can adjust the settings of your mobile device to turn it off.

  


**What Are Cookies, Scripts and Web Beacons and Why Do We Use Them?**To the top ↑

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers stored within your browser. Cookies are accessed and recorded by the websites and companies you visit so that companies may recognize your browser as you navigate online.

We use cookies for the following general purposes, among other purposes:

  * To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor so that we may save and remember any preferences that may have been set when you last visited us. For example, if you register for our Services, we may store your username and password to save you time and convenience when you visit.
  * To help control the display of advertisements you see and customize the content you encounter while using our Services.
  * To help us measure and analyze visitor traffic and usage patterns as well as to improve the quality and effectiveness of our content, features, advertisements, and other communications.



Some of our third-party affiliates may also place cookies within your browser. We do not control these cookies. You may set your browser to accept or reject most cookies, but blocking cookies may prevent access to some of the features of our Services.

**Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologies**

In delivering our Services, we may use scripts, web beacons, and/or similar technologies to collect information about your use of our Services. We use web beacons to improve your experience when you use our Services through providing you with content, advertising, and offers customized to your interest, as well as to understand whether our users read email messages and access links contained within those messages.

**How Do We Use Your Personal Information?**To the top ↑

We believe we can enhance your experience using our Services by analyzing the information you share with us. We analyze the Personal Information you share to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Services usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to personalize the content, layout, and features of our Services. We also use your Personal Information to respond to your comments and questions. We may also use your Personal Information to contact you regarding products and/or services that we think may be of interest to you unless you have elected not to receive these promotions.

We may also match Personal Information we collect through our Services with other information about you supplied by third parties so that we can provide you with customized product and content offerings, as well as to otherwise improve our advertising and marketing efforts.

After registering with one of our Services, you may receive communications from us related to products and services that we believe will interest you. Although we hope you will find these communications informative and useful, you can opt-out from receiving these types of communications from us by changing your privacy preferences in your member profile or by deleting your profile from our database. Please refer to “How Can You Opt-Out of Sharing Your Personal Information or Receiving Our Promotional Communications?” for additional information and instructions.

**With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?**To the top ↑

  


**Our Affiliated Companies**

We may share any information that we collect with any company that is directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or operated by AHC. This is so that AHC and its affiliated companies can communicate with you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. The use and further disclosure of the information collected through our Services by our affiliated companies will be governed by this Policy.

**Vendors, Service Providers and Provider Partners**

We currently have and will continue to have arrangements with third-party vendors and service providers (e.g., credit card processors, shipping companies, fulfillment services, etc.) that assist us with the operation and development of our Services. We reserve the right to share with these companies any information we collect, provided that they commit to use the Personal Information only in relation for the services they provide for us or our users. 

To make our Services more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features of our Services in conjunction with other unaffiliated companies (“Provider Partners”) that specialize in operating such features. For example, we may offer a car buying service, personalized finance and weather information services, social networking tools, sweepstakes offers, or other promotions through cooperative arrangements with Provider Partners. We share Personal Information with our Provider Partners as is useful or necessary for them to provide you with the features that they offer through our cooperative arrangement with them. Some of these Provider Partners may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing their services. Their use of such information will be subject to their own privacy policies. Please refer to “What Other Parties Might Be Collecting Information When You Use Our Services?” for additional information.

**Other Disclosures**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this Policy or within our Services, we reserve the right to release Personal Information about our users when we deem such release to be appropriate to comply with law, respond to compulsory process or law enforcement requests, enforce our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms/), or protect the rights, property or safety of our users, the public, AHC, our affiliates, or any third party. Over time, we may reorganize or transfer various assets and lines of business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein or within our Services, we reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we collect to third parties, in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, foreclosure, liquidation, amalgamation, or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance, or financing of all or any portion of AHC or our affiliates.

**What Other Parties Might Be Collecting Information When You Use Our Services?**To the top ↑

**Third-Party Advertising, Data and Analytics Companies**

We work with third-party advertising companies and data providers to focus and serve some of the advertisements you see on our Services and websites, to send e-mails on our behalf, and to provide related analytics, forecasting, and optimization services. Most of the third-party advertising and data companies we work with, including DoubleClick and Google, are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). To learn more about the information collection practices of NAI and DAA members and your opt-out choices, please visit the NAI’s website [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or the DAA’s website (and opt-out mechanism) at [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Some of the ads you see in our Services may contain cookies and web beacons that are managed by other third parties (e.g., advertisers or their advertising agencies) that we do not control. If you have questions regarding the data collection practices of any of the advertisers that appear on our Services, we encourage you to contact the applicable advertiser.

We also engage Omniture, a third party analytics company, to track and analyze usage and browsing patterns of our users to help us improve our Services.  For information about Omniture’s information collection practices and related opt-out choices, click [here](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/visualsciences/policy). 

When you visit our mobile websites or use our mobile applications, third-party mobile advertising networks in which we participate may collect certain information, including your unique device ID and information about your wireless carrier, carrier user ID, the make, model, and operating system of your device, cookies stored on your mobile browser, location information, and information about how you navigate within our Services. These networks may collect and track such information over time and combine it with other information collected when you access other mobile websites and applications that participate in the network to display advertising that is customized to your interests.

  


**Blogs, Discussion Forums and Community or Social Networking Areas**

This Policy only addresses the use and transfer of information that we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through interactive features, third-party services, or promotions offered on or through the Services, or through other websites throughout the Internet, different policies will apply and AHC will not be responsible for the use or dissemination of such information. Our Services may offer social network tools, message boards, chat rooms, or other forums or interactive areas you can use to communicate with other users or to submit and post your own content (such as stories, blogs, photos and videos, and the like). If you disclose Personal Information in one of these forums, the information can be viewed, collected, and used by others. AHC is not responsible for the dissemination of information you disclose in these forums. We encourage you to consult the forum rules and the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms/) regarding the policies and procedures that apply to that portion of our Services.

**Co-branded Sites and Services**

Our Services may operate as part of a larger group of sites and applications and may carry co-branded pages. In addition, other third-party sites or applications may use the AHC name or the name of one of AHC’s affiliated companies or Services. Since AHC does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies, if any, of such third parties. AHC will not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your Personal Information by such parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties’ privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others.

**What Safeguards Do We Put in Place to Protect Your Personal Information?**To the top ↑

AHC does its best to maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security and integrity of the Personal Information that you provide to us. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our database nor can we guarantee that the Personal Information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.  
For purposes described in this Policy, Personal Information may be transferred to, processed, stored, and accessed by us, our affiliates, and our service providers in the United States and in jurisdictions where any of us may operate.

AHC assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content or privacy practices, if any, of the operators of any such linked websites. The mere linking to a third-party website does not imply endorsement or sponsorship by AHC of the website, products, or services offered on the third-party website.
