    HSBC Bank Australia Limited ABN 48 006 434 162 AFSL No. 232595 (HSBC) respects the privacy of individuals and has developed a privacy policy which embodies the National Privacy Principles.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blackbold">Collection of Information</h2>
    <p>
    HSBC collects the personal information it needs to provide the products and services it offers, which include a broad range of credit, deposit, insurance and other financial products.
    HSBC also collects personal information about its customers and suppliers, or employees or officers of its customers and suppliers, so that it can complete business transactions, purchase products and services, administer accounts, provide customer support and meet regulatory requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
    Where practicable, HSBC will collect personal information directly from the individual concerned.  Sometimes we will collect it from a third party such as a financial adviser, a broker or a credit reporting agency, or from a publicly available source such as a companies or land title office.  The type of information we collect, and where we get it from, will depend on the product or service you or your organisation choose or apply for.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you deal with us by telephone it is possible your call may be monitored or recorded.  The purpose of doing this will depend on which part of our business you are dealing with.  For example, if you telephone one of our call centres your call may be monitored for training and quality control.  If you deal with our treasury area or our margin lending team your call may be recorded for verification and authentication purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
    If we perform a 100 point identification check on, or obtain an identification reference for, an individual who is to become a signatory on an account with us we are doing so to comply with the Financial Transaction Reports Act.
    </p>

    <p>
    If any personal information we need is not available, or not provided, we may not be able to provide the relevant product or service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blackbold">Website collection</h2>
    <p>
    Subject to what follows on our use of cookies, we will not collect any information about you through our Website except where you knowingly provide it to us.  The information we collect about you will depend on how you use the facilities offered by the Website.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, if you visit the Website only to browse or download information, while our system will collect information through standard weblogs (such as the address of your internet service provider, the browser you are using, the operating system you are using and the domain name you came from) that information will not identify you or any of your personal details.  If you enter information in the process of completion of an on-line application form, the information will only be collected by us if you submit that on-line application to us.  In other words, if you log out prior to submitting your application, any information which you have entered will be automatically deleted.  
    </p>

    <p>
    We will collect personal information if you do submit an application on line, or otherwise knowingly provide us with personal information.  We also collect personal information once you are in the secure section of our site (for example when you use it to make transactions or enquiries).
    </p>

    <p>
    </p><h2 class="blackbold">Our use of cookies</h2>
    <p>
    A "cookie" is a small-text file that is transferred to your computer hard drive by a web page server.  Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  However, you can choose if and how a cookie is accepted by configuring your browser accordingly.  The cookie stores information about the use of the site and can be retrieved by the web page server.
    </p>

    <p>
    We do not use cookies in any way which can identify you when you are in the public or open section of our Website.  If you use the secure section of our Website (for example if you use Personal Internet Banking) then we use cookies in a number of ways including to assist in identification, to time sessions (so that you will be logged off if you are not using the facility for a specified time period) and to ensure you are not shown promotional material you have already seen while visiting the site.
    </p>

    <p>
    If your browser is configured to reject all cookies, you will be unable to use the secure section of our Website.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blackbold">Web Beacons</h2>

    <p>
    HSBC works with Yahoo! Australia &amp; NZ Pty Ltd ("Yahoo!") to research certain usage and activities on our website.  Yahoo! uses web beacons to conduct this research.  Web beacons collect aggregated information including user demographics and usage patterns.  This data is used to improve HSBC services and marketing initiatives.  Again, demographic information is gathered in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user.  You may choose to <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/au/pixels/details.html" target="_blank">opt-out of Yahoo!</a> collecting and using this information for this research. Learn more about <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/au/pixels/details.html" target="_blank">Yahoo! web beacons</a>.  
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/au/pixels/details.html" target="_blank">This page</a> has the link which then automatically opts out the user.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blackbold">Use and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
    HSBC will use and disclose information it holds about an individual for the main purpose for which HSBC has collected the information (for example if you apply through us for an insurance policy we will disclose the information on the application to the insurer).  HSBC will also use and disclose it for a secondary purpose related to that main purpose where the individual would reasonably expect us to do so (for example we may disclose to a printer which prints the cheques we issue to access a savings account).  Otherwise, we will keep personal information confidential unless:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the individual agrees - this can be express agreement (for example, where you sign a form or click on a button electronically) or implied agreement (where your conduct suggests you agree or where we offer you an opportunity to tell us that you do not agree and you don't do so); or
      </li><li> we are required or allowed by law to make the disclosure.
    </li></ul>

    <p>We also use personal information for planning, product development, and research purposes and to seek feedback on our products and services.
    </p>

    <p>
    Your personal information may be shared amongst the entities which make up the HSBC Group.  The HSBC Group means HSBC and its related bodies corporate which includes HSBC Asset Management (Australia) Limited.  It also includes HSBC related companies overseas.  In particular, as some of our computer systems are located overseas (with back up in Shanghai), you should be aware we will process your information in those places as necessary to provide the products and services you choose.
    </p>

    <p>
    The sorts of organisations outside the HSBC Group to which we typically disclose personal information include the following.  This is not a complete list - there will be others which are less common or which you have been told, or will be told, about when you applied or apply for the relevant product or service.

    If the law requires us to provide you with information about our products or services, we will provide that information to you even if you have elected not to receive information about our products and services generally.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blackbold">Ensuring your personal information is up-to-date</h2>

    <p>
    We rely on the personal information we hold about you in conducting our business.  Therefore, it is important that the information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date.  This means that from time-to-time we may ask you to tell us if there are any changes to your personal information. If you find that information we hold about you is incorrect, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blackbold">Security of your personal information</h2>

    <p>
    The security of your information is important to HSBC and we take all reasonable precautions to protect your information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some of the ways we protect your information include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> security of external and internal premises;
      </li><li> restricting access to personal information to employees who need it to perform their day-to-day functions;
      </li><li> data encryption technology and firewalls;
      </li><li> maintaining technology to prevent unauthorised computer access including identifiers and passwords; and
      </li><li> maintaining physical security over paper records.
    </li></ul>
    
    <p>
    Do not access Internet Banking from computer terminals which are shared with other users (e.g. Internet cafes), as it is difficult to ensure these PCs are free of hacker programmes (someone might be able to access your personal/account information).
    </p>

    <h2 class="blackbold">Access and correction</h2>

    <p>
    Generally, HSBC allows individuals access to the information it holds about them within a reasonable time after they have made a written request for access.  In some instances, HSBC will refuse to give an individual access to requested information.  If it does so it will provide that individual with the reason it has refused them access.
    </p>

    <p>
    HSBC will correct information it has about an individual if it discovers, or the individual is able to show, the information is incorrect.  If an individual seeks a correction and HSBC disagrees that the information is incorrect, HSBC will provide the individual with it's reasons for taking that view.
    </p>

    <p>
    HSBC may charge a fee for informing an individual what information it has about them.  This fee will be charged to cover HSBC's reasonable costs in locating and supplying the information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blackbold">Updates to HSBC's collection practices for the internet</h2>

    <p>
    HSBC will from time to time review and revise its internet practices and communicate significant legal changes with regards to privacy and use of customer information, or the way we collect information.
    </p>
