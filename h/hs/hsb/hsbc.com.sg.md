## Your privacy matters to us

This section provides specific details of how we treat any information you might wish to provide us when you visit this website. Your use of this website indicates your acceptance of these terms and the terms set out in the website Term of Use and Hyperlink Policy.

###  Security standards

If you receive such a request, please call our 24-hour Customer Service Hotline on [1800-HSBC NOW (4722 669](tel:18004722669)).

We also remind our customers to connect only to www.hsbc.com.sg when accessing Internet Banking. Never follow a link within an e-mail to start an Internet Banking session. Instead, key in directly to the browser address bar our URL ([www.hsbc.com.sg](https://www.hsbc.com.sg/)) to access our secured Internet Banking site.

###  Data security 

  * Security is our top priority. We will strive at all times to ensure that your personal data will be protected against unauthorised or accidental access, processing or erasure. We maintain this commitment to data security by implementing appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure your personal data.
  * The secure area of this Site /App supports the use of Secure SocketLayer(SSL)protocol and 128-encryption technology - an industry standard for encryption over the Internet to protect data. When you provide sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the Internet.
  * Our web servers are protected behind "firewalls" and our systems are monitored to prevent any unauthorised access. We will not send personal information to you by ordinary email. As the security of ordinary email cannot be guaranteed, you should only send email to us using the secure email facility on this Site/App for general enquiry.
  * All practical steps will be taken to ensure that personal data will not be kept longer than necessary and that the Bank will comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements in Singapore concerning the retention of personally identifiable information.



###  Security assurance 

  * Both you and HSBC play an important role in protecting against online fraud. You should be careful that your bank account details including your User ID and/or Password are not compromised by ensuring that you do not knowingly or accidentally share, provide or facilitate unauthorised use of it. Do not share your User ID and/or password or allow access or use of it by others. We endeavor to put in place high standards of security to protect your interests. If, in the unlikely event, unauthorised transactions have been conducted through your account through no fraud, fault or negligence on your part, we will see that you are covered for your direct loss up to the full amount of the unauthorised transaction.
  * You should safeguard your unique User ID and Password by keeping it secret and confidential. Never write them down or share these details with anyone. HSBC will never ask you for your Internet Banking Password, in order to ensure that you are the only person who knows this information. When choosing your unique User ID and Password for the first time, do not create it using easily identifiable information such as your birthday, telephone number or a recognisable part of your name. If you think your User ID and/or password has been disclosed to a third party, is lost or stolen and unauthorised transactions may have been conducted, you are responsible to inform us immediately.
  * In respect of any use by you of this App, you should make sure you keep your mobile telephone or tablet and the security details you use to log onto this App safe and secure. You must let us know as soon as possible if these are lost or stolen. If you choose to activate the feature that allows you to use your biometric credentials to log onto this app (for supported devices only), you should ensure that only your biometric credentials are registered on the device. You may be responsible for unauthorized payments made from your accounts if you have not kept your mobile telephone or tablet and your security details safe, and have not followed the security precautions that we advise you to undertake from time to time, or if the biometric credentials registered on the device are not your own and you have activated such authentication method on the device.
  * You must not use this App on any device or operating system that has been modified outside the mobile device or operating system vendor supported or warranted configurations. This includes devices that have been "jail-broken" or "rooted". A jail broken or rooted device means one that has been freed from the limitations imposed on it by your mobile service provider and the phone manufacturer without their approval. The use of this App on a jail broken or rooted device may compromise security and lead to fraudulent transactions. Download and use of this App in a jail broken or rooted device is entirely at your own risk and the Bank will not be liable for any losses or any other consequences suffered or incurred by you as a result.
  * You should only download this App and its updates from official supplying app store and not from any unofficial sources.
