**COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND SPOTLIGHT TAGS**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disc for record keeping purposes.  
Cookies can make the web more useful by storing information about your preferences on particular sites, thus enablingwebsite owners to provide more useful features for their users. They contain no name or address information or any information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail or any other means. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to disable cookies or inform you when they are set.   
Information on how to disable cookies can be obtained by referring to either your Operating Systems Manual or your Browser Guide, or by contacting your Internet Service Provider. However, given that we may sometimes use cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do disable them.

Our Personal Internet Banking service uses session cookies to establish and maintain your banking session with us. With cookies enabled, you shouldn't notice any difference to the service. Personal Internet Banking requires your web browser to accept a session cookie before you can log on or register for the service. Session cookies only exist until you close down your web browser, as opposed to permanent cookies which your browser stores until they expire. If your browser is set to disable cookies, you won't be able to access Personal Internet Banking.

HSBC web pages may contain electronic images, known as web beacons or spotlight tags. These enable HSBC to count users who have visited certain pages on our website. Web beacons and spotlight tags are not used by us to access your personal information, they are simply a tool we use to analyse which web pages customers view, in an aggregated manner.

By maintaining our commitment to these principles, we at HSBC will ensure that we respect the inherent trust that you place in us.
