**1) What information do we collect online? How do we use it?**

When you place an order on our site, we ask you to provide information by filling out and submitting an online form. This information includes your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, a password, your credit card number and expiration date. We ask for this information so that we can fulfill your order and notify you of your order status via e-mail. The information you provide is stored in our customer file in a secure environment separate from our web site.

We ask you to provide your name, address, phone number and e-mail address when you join an HSN collector's club. We use this information to fulfill your request to automatically receive information on upcoming events, new products or services and special offers we think you'll find valuable.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask you for your name, address, phone number and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify the winners.

If you create an Address Book to store names and addresses of friends or family members, we do not make any use of this information except to provide it to you after you've signed in with your name and password.

If you choose to post messages in our bulletin boards, chat rooms or other message areas, we will collect the information about you that you choose to disclose.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or if users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the site, we may collect the information into a file specific to you.

In order to make improvements to our web sites and to assist in making decisions about our product and content offerings, we may track customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is analyzed only in aggregate or for segments of our customer base, and not at the individual level. Personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, is not included in this analysis.

We do not follow your browsing path outside of the HSN sites.

**2) "Cookies" - What are they? How do we use them?**

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive to give you a unique ID. Cookies help make it easier for you to use our site, and they help us provide you with the information you need, when and where you need it.

Our cookies contain no information about you. They contain only a numeric code that enable us to provide certain features, such as storing items in your Shopping Basket between visits, without losing any of the items in your basket.

The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them at most major web sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our site, but it is possible that some features may not work properly.

In keeping with our standard policy on customer information, we analyze data gathered via cookies only in aggregate or for segments of our customer base, and not at the individual customer level.

**3) Do we share our information with others?**

It is our current policy that Home Shopping Network, its parent company USA Networks Inc. and affiliate companies do not sell or rent your personal information to others.

We may use your personal information -- or share it with our trusted and respected business partners outside the USA Networks family -- to make additional marketing and promotional opportunities available to you. In the future, we may use or share your information for other purposes.

We also may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. These statistics are provided only in the aggregate or for segments of our customer base.

It is our policy that we do not share, sell or trade e-mail addresses, information collected as part of a survey or specific details about you or your household. Except to verify credit card information to complete your order, we do not use or release any credit card or financial information for any purpose. For privacy purposes, all information relating to our customers is stored on a highly secure server that is not accessible via the Internet.

**4) How do we use e-mail?**

HSN will send one e-mail message to confirm each online order you make, and we occasionally use e-mail addresses for promotion of sales, special offers or upcoming events of interest to our customers. Please note that we do not sell or share e-mail addresses with other companies.

If you join our collector's clubs, you will receive e-mail messages, information and special offers available to club members. If you do not wish to receive these messages and offers, do not join an HSN collector's club. 

We encourage you to e-mail us with your comments. Although we are not staffed to respond to individual e-mails, we do read every e-mail received. Contact us at [webmaster@hsn.com](https://web.archive.org/customer_service/contact_us/default.asp).

**5) How can you elect not to receive offers and e-mail?**

If you prefer that we not contact you to make additional marketing and promotional opportunities available to you, and that we not share your personal information with our business partners, we'll give you an opportunity to indicate your preference in the first marketing or promotional e-mail message that we send you, or you may do so by contacting us at [customerservice@hsn.com](https://web.archive.org/customer_service/contact_us/default.asp).

**6) How can you verify and correct personal information?**

You can check your personal information on the Customer Service page by selecting [Change Address](http://www.hsn.com/customer/login/default.asp?Dest=6). If any of this information is incorrect, you can make appropriate changes. If you have any question about the accuracy of personal information, you can contact us by e-mail, phone or mail. (See contact information below.)

**7) How do we protect our customers' information?**

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our customers is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers by utilizing industry standard efforts, such as firewalls, Secure Socket Layers and encryption software. All information relating to our customers is stored on a highly secure server that is not accessible via the internet.

However, total security does not exist on the Internet. Please keep in mind whenever you give out personal information online - for example, via message boards or chat rooms - that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While HSN strives to protect its users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. Your continued use of the HSN sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
