<h3 align="center">HSH® Associates' Privacy Policy</h3>

<div style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:2em; text-align:justify">

<p>The websites <i>HSH.com</i>, <i>Homeplans.HSH.com</i>, <i>
BestRates.com</i> and <i>Bankrates.com</i>, as well as other domains
registered by us (the "websites") are subsidiaries of 
<a href="http://www.hsh.com/abouthsh.html">HSH Associates, Financial
Publishers</a>. We are totally committed to protecting your privacy. This
is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us
while visiting our Web site.</p>

<p>(If you believe that you were spammed by our Bestrates.com
site, please <a href="http://www.hsh.com/spamalert.html">click
here</a> to discover how the real spammer fooled you.)</p>

<p>It has been our policy, since the company was founded in 1979, 
to never sell personally identifying information about our customers.</p>

<ul style="display: block; list-style-type: circle; font-size: smaller">
 <li> HSH does not collect personally identifying information,
 except with your specific knowledge and consent.</li>

 <li> We <i>never</i> sell or offer contact information about our
 visitors to others. There's no need to send us an "opt out"
 message to prevent your name from appearing on a million mailing
 lists.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Click here to read our A HREF="http://www.hsh.com/privacy-ext.html" extended privacy Statement. -->

<p>In some cases, such as if you e-mail a question or a comment to us,
we may <i>request</i> your name, e-mail address or other information so
that we can, for example, e-mail you with a personal reply. If you
choose to supply this information, we will use it only for the specific
purpose for which you supply it.
<!-- unless we tell you otherwise at the time of collection, in which case you'll have an option to forbid other uses by us. -->
</p>

<p>In other cases, we may <i>require</i> certain personal
information -- such as when you fill out an order form on our site
(or submit an order to us through some means such as phone, fax,
mail, or e-mail); when you request that we send your information
to a <i> Showcase</i> lender; when you sign up for our free
content; and similar cases. In these cases, you must enter your
name, address, and certain other information. The information you
provide goes <b>only</b> to the party(s) you select, so that they
can fulfill your order (or request). Obviously, we must collect
this information so your order (or request) can be fulfilled. We
maintain the information you provide (other than credit card
information) to evidence that you have purchased a product.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2.25em; margin-right: 2.25em">We never
share any of your personally identifying data with any other party
without your explicit permission, nor use it for unapproved
commercial purposes.</p>

<p>Some customers find it irritating that, when they re-order a
product from us, we don't have their information on file. They
need to give us their name, address, and other information every
time they re-order. That's because we delete all computer
references to your order 30 days after the product is shipped to
you.</p>

<p>We retain a <i>paper</i> record of your order for about six
months, in case you need to call us. After that time, the paper
record is destroyed as well.</p>

<p>We may <i>offer</i> to send you information or updates from HSH
Associates via e-mail or otherwise, such as HSH's <a href="http://www.hsh.com/trends.html">Weekly Market Trends</a> mailing
list. Obviously, signing up will put you on a specific mailing
list. We will <i>not</i> put you on any other mailing lists, from
us or anyone else, without your permission.</p>

<a name="cookies">
</a><p><a name="cookies"><b>About "cookies."</b></a> Some Web sites use cookies which
contain information such as registration information, or similar data,
which is stored on your hard drive and sent back to a site when you
revisit it. HSH Associates does not, as a rule, use cookies. There are
two instances in which we may use cookies. First, on our Homeplans site,
we use cookies <i>only while you are visiting that site</i> ('session
ID' cookies) and which are <i>not</i> placed by, or sent to, any third
party. <a href="http://homeplans.hsh.com/cookies.asp">Click here</a> to 
read more about our use of these cookies. Second, in our <i>Showcase</i>
pages, if you choose to fill out a lender's "information
request" coupon, you will be asked if you would like to have
a cookie set to preserve the information you've just provided
(name, address, etc.) for use on other lender coupons. This will
be done <i>only with your consent</i>, and that information
expires (will be deleted from your computer) 4 hours from the time
you leave the HSH site (a 'session' cookie).</p>

<p><b>About spam.</b> If you are receiving "mortgage-rate" spam,
it's not because of us. The information you provide goes only to the lender(s)
you have selected, <i>and no one else.</i> If you have visited any other mortgage 
rate sites, <i>read their privacy policies very carefully.</i></p>

<p>Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined
above, we do analyze our 'hit' logs to see how we're doing. However, we
only use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For
instance, we like to know that a certain percentage of our users appear
to be in the market for a certain loan type, based on the pages they
view.</p>

<p>Our privacy policy may be modified from time to time; the last update
was on July 22, 2004.</p>
