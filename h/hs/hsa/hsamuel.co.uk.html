			<h2 id="privacy">Privacy policy</h2>

			<p>We understand that privacy is important to you, and we promise to look after your personal information. Any personal information you provide to us will only be used and recorded in accordance with the Data Protection Act. We will not sell any information about you to any other party.</p>

			<h3>What information do we collect from you? </h3>
			<p>We will only have information about you if you willingly provide it. The information you provide is referred to as personal information. Please make sure you <a href="/webstore/secure/myaccount.do">update your personal information</a> if any of your details change.</p>
			<p>In order to do any of the following, you will need to provide us with certain details:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>place an order</li>
				<li>sign up for e-newsletters</li>
				<li>enter competitions</li>
				<li>take part in a survey (in this instance, your details will be passed to a third party for research purposes only)</li>
				<li>give feedback to us</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The details you provide may include your name, email address, delivery address, telephone number, credit or debit card number and the card's expiry date. </p>

			<h3>How will we use it?</h3>
			<p>We will use this information to fulfil any order and to communicate with you when necessary. If you provide us with your debit or credit card details, we will record them so that you can save time and use them when you next order with us.</p>
			<p>We may also use your personal information to contact you about news and offers that we think may interest you, or to tell you if we change anything important about how the website works, or the terms of use of the website. </p>
			<p>If you decide at any point that you no longer wish to receive messages of this nature, please <a href="/webstore/secure/contactus.do">Contact Us</a> and send an email to let us know. Alternatively, click to unsubscribe at the bottom of any of the emails you receive.</p> 
			<p>Please note that if you <a href="/webstore/secure/contactus.do">telephone us</a>, calls may be recorded for training purposes.</p>

			<h3>Will we share your personal information with anyone else?</h3>
			<p>We may want to share your personal information with other reputable companies and businesses working with us, such as our email provider. We will never release your personal details to any outside company for mailing or marketing purposes.</p>
			<p>Payments on the website are processed by a third party, which adheres to the privacy policy that is set out here. We have a non-disclosure agreement with this third party, and they are certified by all the major card issuers to hold details securely.</p>

			<h3>How long will we keep your information?</h3>
			<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as necessary and consistent with the purpose for which you have given it to us. Except where needed to respond to a query from you or fulfil an order, we will delete your personal information on request by you.</p>

			<h3>What are 'cookies' and how do we use them?</h3>
			<p>When you place an order on the website and enter your name and details, you will become a recognised user, and we will send a cookie to your computer. A cookie is a small file that may be placed on your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies do not contain any information that can personally identify you. They help us to recognise you when you visit the website and make use of the service so that the service can be tailored to your needs. Our email provider may set cookies on your browser if you open an email they send you on our behalf.</p>
			<p>By using cookies, we can make your online experience more efficient. For example, they allow you to store your chosen items in your shopping basket, without losing them between visits, and to make the checkout process faster by having your card and delivery details ready to use. </p>
			<p>We will also use cookies for the compilation of certain statistics (which do not identify you personally) relating to the use of the website. Such information may include the number of visits, average time spent, and other statistics relating to the website. </p>
			<p>You may see H.Samuel adverts on other websites. For these adverts, we will be using software that may set a cookie to your browser. This software will allow us to monitor if you see our adverts, if you click on them and if you go on to buy from our website.</p>
			<p>You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you decline to accept a cookie, some web pages may not function properly or you may not be permitted to access certain services offered on the website.</p>

			<div class="generic-return"><p><a href="#content">back to top</a></p></div>

			<h2 id="security">Security guarantee</h2>

			<p>Our website uses a secure server which uses SSL technology (secure sockets layer) to make sure that all your credit or debit card transactions are completely secure.</p> 
			<p>Every time we receive an order, we use fraud checking systems as well as authentication processes before we fulfil it. </p>
			<p>When you use our website, the secure server will encrypt all of the personal information you send us, including credit or debit card number and name and address. Encryption turns the information you enter into bits of code which are then securely transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>
			<p>We will take all reasonable measures to keep your personal information, order and payment details secure. However, we cannot be held liable if an event beyond our control results in loss to you.</p>

			<div class="generic-return"><p><a href="#content">back to top</a></p></div>

			<h2 id="safeShopping">Safe shopping at H.Samuel</h2>

			<p>At H.Samuel we are committed to protecting you against unauthorised transactions and ensuring that our payment process is as safe and secure as possible. As well as our SSL technology (mentioned above), we have implemented extra levels of security to protect your online transactions.</p>

			<h3>Security Code</h3>
			<p>We will ask for your security code when you enter your card details. This is the last three digits on the signature strip on the back of your credit or switch card. It guarantees that you physically have the card when you order and ensures that fraudulent orders cannot be placed with your card number alone.</p>

			<h3>MasterCard SecureCode (for MasterCard and Maestro cards) and Verified by Visa (for Visa cards)</h3>
			<p>When you are entering your payment details on our website, a box will pop up giving you the option to register with either MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa (depending on which type of card you have), or to sign into them if you have already registered.</p>
			<p>MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa work in the same way. Both systems protect your existing credit card with a secret password that you create. Your password is registered with your card-issuing bank and from then on you can use the same password whenever you use that card to pay for goods at HSamuel.co.uk or with any other websites that use this technology.</p>

			<h3>Retail Decisions' (ReD) ebitGuard technology</h3>
			<p>ReD's ebitGuard technology is designed to detect card fraud, particularly international fraud, in an online environment.</p>
			<p>By using this technology, H.Samuel can check purchaser information against multiple public records for accuracy and consistency, identify computer-generated fraud that is not always picked up by other standard systems, screen fraud databases and much more.</p>

			<div class="generic-return"><p><a href="#content">back to top</a></p></div>

			<h2 id="children">Children</h2>

			<p>By using the website you confirm that you are at least 18 years old, or, if you are under 18, that you are accessing the website with the consent of your parent of guardian. We do not sell products to children, but we do sell children's products for purchase by adults.</p>
