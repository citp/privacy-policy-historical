  * **Information we may receive from third parties**.  We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may collect information about you from social media sites.  If you access our website or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, or by “following,” or “liking,” HSF, or sharing your activities on our site on social media, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to HSF.  This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook User ID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.  This information may be used to pre-populate your HSF account.  If you allow us access to your friends’ list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the HSF.  You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.  If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.  We may also request and collect information about you from third parties such as teachers, schools, and other referral sources, providers of background check services, billing and credit agencies, and other third parties.

We use the information we collect or receive to operate, maintain, and provide you with the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you.  For instance, we may use information you provide us for purposes such as statistical analysis, marketing and promoting our scholarship programs, and referrals for internships and financial aid opportunities.

**Information we collect through technology:**

  * **Cookies information**.  When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets HSF help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.  Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions.  A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.  You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

  * **Log file information**.  Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service.  When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information.  These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

  * **Clear GIFs/web beacons information**.  When you use the Service, we may employ clear Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), also known as web beacons, which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users.  In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.  The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

  * **Device identifiers**.  When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more unique device identifiers.  Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device.  A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Company.  A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service.  A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service.  Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

  * **Use of information collected through technology**.  We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, and clear GIFs information to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; and (e) diagnose or fix technology problems.

**IX.        _HSF DONOR PRIVACY POLICY / STATEMENT_**

  
HSF respects the privacy of its donors.  This section of the Privacy Policy relates specifically to our donors.  Our general website Privacy Policy provides helpful information about our data practices. Please see the Privacy Policy above for terms governing our general website privacy terms and related information and disclosures.

**HSF Donor Privacy Statement:**   HSF will never trade, share or sell Donor Personal Information with anyone else, except as required by law.  For purposes of our Donor Privacy Policy, “Donor Personal Information” means information that identifies donors personally, such as a donor’s name, address, email address, and telephone number.  HSF maintains Donor Personal Information for purposes of informing you of opportunities to participate in and/or support the mission and work of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund. At any time, you may request to be removed from our contact list  **or revoke your authorization (if previously given) for HSF to share Personal Information**. To do so, simply [contact us](https://web.archive.org/en/contact-us/).

  
**Collection of Donor Information**.  If you register to participate in an HSF event (e.g. a dinner, outreach event, golf tournament, etc.) using our event registration site, we collect your Donor Personal Information.  We may also ask you if you are an HSF scholarship recipient to better understand the community involvement of our alumni.

**Contribution**.  If you choose to use a credit card to donate or purchase through this site, we process through a secure third party payment gateway, Authorize.net standard credit card information (card number, card type, expiration date) and keep a record of your financial transaction. Credit card numbers are passed through Authorize.net only until the charge can be processed (usually several minutes). HSF does not retain credit card information. If you submit your credit card information on paper, the information is destroyed immediately after the transaction is complete.

**Requests**.  If you submit an online request for HSF products such as free brochures, or submit a question through a “contact us” query, we may have to gather additional information from you to respond to your request. Such information will vary with the request but often includes name, shipping address, telephone number, and email address.

**Use of Donor Data**.  If you provide Donor Personal Information to HSF, we may enter your name into our constituent database and contact you in order to:

  * Complete voluntary surveys seeking feedback for quality and service improvement purposes.

  * Supply you with information including HSF related news, HSF programs, events and services.

  * Request voluntary time or monetary contributions to HSF.

  * Request your participation in an HSF research studies.




Additionally, our annual report publishes the names of individuals who contribute $1,000 and above. You may, however, choose to waive this benefit by designating your support as “anonymous.” This ensures your name will never appear on any public, HSF donor list.

This Donor Privacy Policy applies to all Donor Personal Information that HSF receives, both online (including through its website or mobile applications) and offline, as well as other electronic, written, or oral communications.  To the extent any donations are processed through a third-party service provider, Donor Personal Information will be used only for purposes of processing the donation.
