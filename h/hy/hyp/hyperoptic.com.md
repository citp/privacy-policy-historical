**IP ADDRESSES**

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

**COOKIES**

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. They help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for our website to operate.

If you register with us or if you continue to use our website, you agree to our use of cookies.

Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the website. A cookie is a small text file we pass to your computer’s hard disk through your web browser so the website remembers who you are when you return.

Hyperoptic uses the following cookies in its website to give you a more personalised web service.

The first type is known as a “session-based” cookie and is allocated to your computer only for the duration of your visit to our website. It helps you to move around the website faster. This cookie automatically expires when you close down your browser.

We use a type of cookie called a “persistent” cookie. These cookies store information between visits. For example, if you select the ‘Remember me on this computer’ box your username and password is saved in a cookie on your computer. This means next time you log on to the site using that computer you will not need to re enter those details. We suggest you do not select the ‘Remember me’ box if you use a shared computer (for example, if you access the Internet at a cafe, or at a shared or publicly available computer). However, you will still need to use your username and password to access your profile. The cookie file itself does not store your personal information.

Finally, Hyperoptic uses Google Analytics to track use of our website and to help us to analyse how users use the site. Google Analytics uses cookies to gather statistics about our visitors, such as where you come from before entering our websites and which websites you go to afterwards. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Information collected in this way is anonymous and individuals cannot be traced. This information allows us to improve our website and our services, for example, to assess the impact of and develop our advertising campaigns and services.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google undertakes not to associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

If you have Adobe Flash installed on your computer (most computers do) and you use Hyperoptic’s audio or video players, Google Analytics will try to store some additional data on your computer. This data is known as a Local Shared Object or Flash cookie. This helps us to analyse the popularity of our media files. We can count the total number of times each file is played, how many people watch videos right to the end and how many people give up half way through. Adobe’s website offers tools to control Flash cookies on your computer.

For more information about Google Analytics, please see their privacy policy at: <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/>

Except for essential cookies, all cookies will expire after 12 months.

You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. If you want to stop cookies being stored on your computer in future, please refer to your browser manufacturer’s instructions by clicking “Help” in your browser menu. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be to access all or parts of our website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon you visit our website.

If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies.

You can learn about and opt out of a number of commercial third party cookies (including some used by Hyperoptic) at www.networkadvertising.org/choices. Some of the opt-outs [used by our commercial service providers] require a cookie to be placed on your computer which is only used to tell the relevant cookie servers not to send you any further cookies. This can be quite handy, but note that if you routinely delete cookies from your temporary internet files, it may be necessary for you to repeat the opt-out process, the next time you visit our website.
