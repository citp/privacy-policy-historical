Other than as provided in this Privacy Policy, Hyper Island will not knowingly share personal data you provide with any third party. In cases where it is necessary for Hyper Island to carry out our services, we may retain external suppliers (processors) for services in connection to our digital channels or the services. These suppliers may process personal data and sometimes require limited access to personal data collected via our digital channels or services. Hyper Island uses the following types of suppliers:

Hyper Island endeavors to limit third-party access and only share information that is necessary to enable suppliers to carry out their work.

During support and maintenance, Hyper Island may have to transfer the information outside of EEA, also when Hyper Island shares data with our group companies in order to carry out our services.

Any such data will always be kept to a minimum relevant for the purpose. No matter where your personal data is transferred Hyper Island always take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the security level is the same as in the EEA and at an adequate security level, for example by using the EU Commission’s Standard Clauses or ensure that the supplier is Privacy-Shield registered.

### **Deletion of data**

Personal data will not be stored for longer than is necessary in light of the purposes of the processing and, in general, Hyper Island will delete personal data in the manner which follows from applicable legislation and in accordance with our Retention Policy.

For example, if the information is no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose they were collected for, they are processed in an illegal way, or you opt out from direct marketing. Please note that, when legally required, Hyper Island could decline your request, for example if the data is needed for tax or bookkeeping purposes, or are necessary to defend legal claims.

You also have the right to request limitations of the processing of your personal data. In such cases, Hyper Island may need to investigate the situation further prior to reaching a decision. Please be aware that you always have a right to opt out from direct marketing activities and request limitation of processing based on legitimate interest – including potential profiling for direct marketing purposes.

When you provide Hyper Island with your consent, or the processing is based on fulfillment of an agreement with you, you have, during certain circumstances a right to have your data transferred to another data controller. This requires that the transfer is technically possible and may be carried out automatically.
