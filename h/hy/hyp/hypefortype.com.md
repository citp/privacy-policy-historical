## **Privacy Policy**

HypeForType understands your need for privacy. The personal information we ask for when you place your order with HypeForType is kept confidential. We will not intentionally sell, rent or share your details with other parties. From time to time, we will email you information about special sales, events, upgrades, or what we believe you will have an interest in. HypeForType never shares, sells, rents, or tends its electronic or conventional mailing database. Addresses are obtained from users visiting and purchasing on our website and other means. The database is used for catalogs and occasional mailings pertaining to promotions and sales at HypeForType. As you browse HypeForType, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partner, Adroll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with HypeForType. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number.

You understand that information transmitted over public networks may be accessed by Third parties, and HypeForType will not be liable for any such unauthorised disclosure. Further, you understand that HypeForType may, at its discretion, use third-party service providers to administer Web servers and to store such information on back-up disks, and that a service provider may without HypeForType's knowledge permit an unauthorised third party to do so on its behalf.
