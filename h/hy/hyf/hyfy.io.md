Kickdrum also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information. Kickdrum may also collect user location information, as further described in the “Global Positioning System” paragraph below.

 **Uses of Information**

WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, TO ANY THIRD PARTY WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. EVER.

Except as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared. From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the interests of our users. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly. Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or email address with a partner company will be done only with your permission. Kickdrum reserves the right to disclose information when required by law. We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. Kickdrum may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Kickdrum’s server and to administer Kickdrum’s web site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information. The Kickdrum site registration form requires users to give Kickdrum contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). Kickdrum uses your contact information from the registration form to send you information about Kickdrum and promotional material from some of Kickdrum’s partners. Your contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary. Kickdrum may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the your experience on the Kickdrum website and/or applications, show you content that Kickdrum thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with third parties ONLY on an aggregate basis. Furthermore, Kickdrum shall have the right to retain records of all data pertaining to use of the website and applications including, but not limited to, usage, activity logs, and click-throughs. Kickdrum may disclose such data to third parties provided it is grouped with other Kickdrum users’ data and is presented in an aggregate form. For further clarification, Kickdrum owns and shall continue to own all right, title and interest in and to all aggregate and statistical information, benchmarking, comparison, and other analytics or analyses created or developed by Kickdrum from performance and usage data generated through your use of the products or services (collectively, “Aggregate Data”).

If you are under the age of 18, you should use this website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any personal information to us. If we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with any personal information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such person's personal information from all Kickdrum systems.
