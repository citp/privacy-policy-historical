&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div><b>5. Disclosure

&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Generally, Hyundai may disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with the purposes described in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy. This may include:

&nbsp;</div></div><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><div><br></div><div>•Hyundai and our authorised Hyundai dealers share personal information about Hyundai customers and prospective customers, so we may disclose your personal information to our authorised Hyundai dealers and vice versa.

&nbsp;</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div><br></div><div>•as otherwise permitted or required by law.

&nbsp;</div></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><div><br></div><div>Your provision to us, our authorised Hyundai dealers, or agents of your personal information will constitute your consent for us to disclose this information as described in this Section 5 and Section 6 below.

&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We will take reasonable commercial steps to ensure our service providers keep your personal information confidential, not to use or disclose it for any purpose other than the purpose of performing their work for us, and in a manner consistent with the Privacy Act. 

&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If we intend to use or disclose your personal information in a manner which is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, we will seek your consent to do so. 

&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you post information to certain parts of our website or to our social media channels, you acknowledge that such information may be publicly available. We recommend that you use your discretion in deciding what information you upload to such websites.

&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>6. Disclosure overseas

&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Some of the third parties to whom we disclose personal information may be located outside Australia.  For example, we may disclose personal information to our related companies within Hyundai Motor Group in South Korea, India and Czech Republic.<br>Other service providers may be located overseas.  The countries in which these third parties are located will depend on the circumstances.  In the ordinary course of business we may disclose personal information to parties located in the United States, Canada and India.  Except where an exemption applies under the Privacy Act, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such overseas recipients do not breach the APP’s in the Privacy Act in relation to such information.

&nbsp;</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>7. Storage and security</b>

&nbsp;</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Security of your personal information is important to us and we will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. However, to the extent permitted by law we exclude all liability (including in negligence) for the consequences of any unauthorised access to, disclosure of, misuse of or loss or corruption of your personal information.<br><br>  
Personal information held by us is stored within secured premises by Hyundai Motor Company Australia and Hyundai Motor Group and its related companies in South Korea. The storage facilities have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>8. Access &amp; Correction</b>

&nbsp;
</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">You may seek access to your personal information which we hold about you and we will provide you with access in accordance with the APP’s. We may require that you provide suitable identification for security purposes before allowing you to access your personal information. We may also charge an access fee to cover the reasonable cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to you. Access to your personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where access poses a health or safety risk, the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your access, we will give you reasons why.<br><br>
We endeavour to maintain your personal information as accurately as reasonably possible.  We rely on accuracy of personal information as provided to us both directly (from you) and indirectly (i.e., from an authorised Hyundai dealer).  Therefore, it is very important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up to date. If you become aware that any personal information which we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete, misleading, irrelevant or not up to date, please contact us using our details below to correct or update your personal information.

&nbsp;
</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Our website may contain links to websites owned or operated by third parties, including websites owned or operated by authorised Hyundai dealers or third party service providers affiliated with Hyundai. We take no responsibility for the privacy practices or content of these other websites. These other websites may contain their own privacy policies and their owners or operators are responsible for informing you about their security and privacy practices. We recommend that you thoroughly read the privacy policies of these third party websites.

&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>10. Links, cookies and use of the Hyundai website</b>

&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Our website contains links to other websites. This Privacy Policy applies to the Hyundai website and not any linked websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each website that collects your personal information.<br><br>
Hyundai uses technology such as "cookies", "pixel tags" and java code on Hyundai websites and in emails you have agreed to receive from us. The use of "cookies", "pixel tags" and java code is an industry standard, and helps us monitor the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use Hyundai websites. A "cookie" is a small data element stored by your web browser on your computer system. If selected by you, the Hyundai websites will store your username and password in a "cookie" to enable you to be automatically logged in when you return (such as within the myHyundai website). Hyundai website "cookies" do not store your email address or other personal information about you.

<br><br>
We use this technology to generate statistics and measure website activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. During normal website usage we do not collect or store personal information such as your name, mailing address, email address or phone number.

<br><br>
Each time you access Hyundai websites, our server may deliver certain customised information, including ads, to you based on the data stored in your cookie. Third party vendors may show our ads on websites on the Internet and serve these ads based on a user’s prior visits to our website and other Internet activity. Hyundai may also use analytics data supplied by third party vendors to inform and optimise our ad campaigns.
