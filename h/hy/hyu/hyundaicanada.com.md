### What Personal Information Does Hyundai Collect and How Does Hyundai Collect It?

Hyundai collects personal information about you that is reasonably necessary for the purposes described above.

We may collect this information directly from you or from our service providers and dealers. When required by law, your personal information is only collected with your consent.

When you purchase or lease a vehicle, a Hyundai dealer will collect information about you that will be shared with Hyundai for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. The collection of information shall be subject to any additional terms provided at the time of such transaction. 

Hyundai may also use technology together with your profile information, such as your purchase history, preferences and/or contact information, to provide you with targeted, interest-based and/or behavioral content and advertising and may conduct such activities, as well as data analytics in this respect, in conjunction with third party service providers, social media platforms or other entities. Hyundai and/or other entities, such as ad network providers, publishers and other media entities, may use cookies or other tracking methods to gather information, or otherwise have access to information about you, and may target content to you based on this information and your profile information on various platforms and media. You may choose to alter the settings of your browser to turn off cookies. To opt-out of online advertising programs that track your activities online, visit Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, NAI opt-out page, the AD Choices Opt-out page and/or any other similarly applicable organization. Opting out in this manner will not prevent advertising from appearing online, but such advertising will not be targeted based on your activities and interests.

You may be required to provide certain contact and other information such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, age, and other information that may be required to provide or administer these services or promotions.

### Electronic Data Recorders

Your vehicle may contain an event data recorder (EDR), which can collect and store information about your vehicle and its occupants immediately before and during a collision or near collision event.
