## Introduction

At Hyundai Motor Company Australia Pty Limited ABN 58 008 995 588 (" **Hyundai** ", " **we** ", " **us** " or " **our** "), we recognise the importance of your privacy and appreciate that your personal information is very important to you. We are committed to complying with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (" **Privacy Act** "), and in particular the Australian Privacy Principles (" **APP's** "). Where applicable, Hyundai will handle personal information relying on the related bodies corporate exemption and the employee records exemption in the Privacy Act and any other applicable exemptions in the Privacy Act or other legislation.

In this Privacy Policy "personal information" has the meaning set out in the Privacy Act. Basically, personal information is information or an opinion about an individual who is reasonably identifiable.

  * we collect your personal information so that we can do business together and for reasons related to our business operations, such as to ensure we deliver quality products and services to our customers and potential customers;
  * to respond to your enquiries about our Hyundai vehicles, parts, accessories, services or offers;

If you wish to unsubscribe from marketing material you receive from a Hyundai dealer, please contact that dealer directly.

## 4\. Consequences if you don't provide your personal information?

If we are unable to collect personal information we require, we may not be able to do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected, or advise you of information in relation to Hyundai vehicles, parts, accessories or Hyundai services or offers.  For example, if we did not collect personal information about your new vehicle purchase, we would be unable to remind you directly of a service that is due, or notify you of a field service action for the vehicle.

## 5\. Disclosure

Generally, Hyundai may disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with the purposes described in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy.  This may include:

  * Hyundai and our authorised Hyundai dealers share personal information about Hyundai customers and prospective customers, so we may disclose your personal information to our authorised Hyundai dealers and vice versa. 
  * our employees, officers, contractors, service providers and agents (such as mailing houses, marketing agencies, market research providers, printers, roadside assistance service providers, insurance providers, financiers, website and data hosting providers and other IT suppliers); 
  * our related and affiliated companies within Hyundai Motor Group; 
  * our accountants, insurers, lawyers, auditors and other professional advisors; 
  * if you perform work for Hyundai under a service arrangement, to your employer or labour agency; 
  * if you apply for a job at Hyundai, to contracted service providers for purposes such as screening, skill or aptitude testing and human resource management activities; 
  * any third parties to whom you direct or permit us to disclose your personal information; 
  * third parties that require the information for law enforcement or to prevent a serious threat to public safety; and
  * as otherwise permitted or required by law. 



Your provision to us, our authorised Hyundai dealers, or agents of your personal information will constitute your consent for us to disclose this information as described in this Section 5 and Section 6 below.

We will take reasonable commercial steps to ensure our service providers keep your personal information confidential, not to use or disclose it for any purpose other than the purpose of performing their work for us, and in a manner consistent with the Privacy Act.

If we intend to use or disclose your personal information in a manner which is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, we will seek your consent to do so.

If you post information to certain parts of our website or to our social media channels, you acknowledge that such information may be publicly available.  We recommend that you use your discretion in deciding what information you upload to such websites.

## 6\. Disclosure overseas

Some of the third parties to whom we disclose personal information may be located outside Australia.  For example, we disclose personal information to our related companies within Hyundai Motor Group in South Korea, India and Czech Republic.

Other service providers may be located overseas.  The countries in which these third parties are located will depend on the circumstances.  In the ordinary course of business we may disclose personal information to parties located in the United States, Canada and India.  Except where an exemption applies under the Privacy Act, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such overseas recipients do not breach the APP's in the Privacy Act in relation to such information.

## 7\. Storage and security

Security of your personal information is important to us and we will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. However, to the extent permitted by law we exclude all liability (including in negligence) for the consequences of any unauthorised access to, disclosure of, misuse of or loss or corruption of your personal information.

Personal information held by us is stored within secured premises by Hyundai Motor Company Australia and Hyundai Motor Group and its related companies in South Korea. The storage facilities have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

## 8\. Access & Correction

You may seek access to your personal information which we hold about you and we will provide you with access in accordance with the APP's. We may require that you provide suitable identification for security purposes before allowing you to access your personal information. We may also charge an access fee to cover the reasonable cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to you. Access to your personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where access poses a health or safety risk, the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your access, we will give you reasons why.

We endeavour to maintain your personal information as accurately as reasonably possible.  We rely on accuracy of personal information as provided to us both directly (from you) and indirectly (i.e., from an authorised Hyundai dealer).  Therefore, it is very important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up to date. If you become aware that any personal information which we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete, misleading, irrelevant or not up to date, please contact us using our details below to correct or update your personal information.

## 9\. Third party websites

Our website may contain links to websites owned or operated by third parties, including websites owned or operated by authorised Hyundai dealers or third party service providers affiliated with Hyundai. We take no responsibility for the privacy practices or content of these other websites. These other websites may contain their own privacy policies and their owners or operators are responsible for informing you about their security and privacy practices. We recommend that you thoroughly read the privacy policies of these third party websites.
