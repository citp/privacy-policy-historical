<h2>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henyep Capital Markets (UK) Limited (“HYCM”, “The Company”, “The firm”, “we” or “us”), is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. The company appears on the FCA's Register: HYCM's FCA registration number is 186171. Further information may be obtained from the FCA's Register by visiting the FCA's website <u><a href="http://www.fca.org.uk/register">http://www.fca.org.uk/register</a></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The present privacy policy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>provides an overview of how the Company collects, processes and uses your personal data and informs you about your rights under the local data protection law and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR“),</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>is directed to natural persons who are either current or potential customers of HYCM, or are authorised representatives/agents or beneficial owners of legal entities or of natural persons which/who are current or potential customers of HYCM,</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>is directed to natural persons who had such a business relationship with the Company in the past,</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>contains information about when we share your personal data with other members of the HYCM Group and other third parties (for example, our service providers or suppliers).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this privacy policy, your data may be called either “<em>personal data</em>” or “<em>personal information</em>”. We may also sometimes collectively refer to handling, collecting, protecting and storing your personal data or any such action as “processing” such personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the purposes of this policy, personal data shall mean any information relating to you which identifies or may identify you and which includes, for example, your name, address and identification number.</p>
<h1>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY</h1>
<p>The present Privacy Policy aims to help you better understand the most recent changes to the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy and how they may impact you. To fully understand the changes and terms that will govern your use of our “Services,” you will need to read the full Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the processing activities performed by HYCM to the personal data of its clients and its potential clients, website visitors and employees. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites operated by any other organisations or other third parties.</p>
<p><em>Please note that if you are an employee of the Company, a contractor to the Company or a third-party service provider, your personal information will be used in connection with your employment contract or your contractual relationship, whichever applies</em>.</p>
<h1>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PURPOSES</h1>
<p>We may process your personal data on the following bases and for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We process personal data in order to provide our services and products, as well as information regarding our products and services based on the contractual relationship with our clients (i.e. so as to perform our contractual obligations). In addition, processing of personal data takes place to be able to complete our client on-boarding/acceptance procedures.</p>
<p>In view of the above, we need to verify your identity in order to accept you as our client and we will need to use those details in order to effectively manage your trading account with us. This may include third parties carrying out sanctions checks on our behalf. The use of your personal information is necessary for us to know who you are as we have a legal obligation to comply with ‘Know Your Customer’ and 'Customer Due Diligence’ regulatory obligations.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Compliance with a legal obligation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are a number of legal obligations imposed by relevant laws to which we are subject, as well as specific statutory requirements (e.g. anti-money laundering laws, financial services laws, corporation laws, privacy laws and tax laws). There are also various supervisory authorities whose laws and regulations apply to us. Such obligations and requirements impose on us necessary personal data processing activities for credit checks, identity verification, payment processing, compliance with court orders, tax law or other reporting obligations and anti-money laundering controls.</p>
<p>These obligations apply at various times, including client on-boarding/acceptance, payments and systemic checks for risk management.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>For the purposes of safeguarding legitimate interests</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We process personal data so as to safeguard the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. Despite that, it must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you. Examples of such processing activities include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>initiating legal claims and preparing our defense in litigation procedures;</li>
<li>means and processes we undertake to provide for the Company’s IT and system security, preventing potential crime, asset security, admittance controls and anti-trespassing measures;</li>
<li>setting up CCTV systems (e.g. at our premises for security reasons);</li>
<li>measures to manage business and for further developing products and services;</li>
<li>sharing your personal data within the HYCM Group for the purpose of updating/verifying your personal data in accordance with the relevant anti-money laundering compliance framework;</li>
<li>risk management</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>For Identity Verification purposes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Company needs to perform its due diligence measures and apply the principles of KYC (Know-Your-Client) before entering a client relationship in order to prevent actions, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, and also to perform other duties imposed by law. Therefore, we collect from our clients’ identity verification information (such as images of your government issued national ID card or International Passport, or driving licence or other governmental proof of identification, as permitted by applicable laws) or other authentication information. We are also requesting our clients to provide us with a recent Utility Bill in order to verify their address. Further to this, the Company can use third parties which carry out identity checks on its behalf.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>You have provided your consent</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our storage and use of your personal data is based on your consent (other than for the reasons described or implied in this policy when your consent is not required). You may revoke consent at any time; however, any processing of personal data prior to the receipt of your revocation will not be affected.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>To assess the appropriateness of our services/products for the Clients</strong></li>
<li><strong>To provide you with products and services, or information about our products and services, and to review your ongoing needs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you successfully open a trading account with us, or subscribe to an update or webinar, we will need to use your personal information to perform our services and comply with our obligations to you. It is also in our legitimate interests to try to ensure that we are providing the best products and services so we may periodically review your needs based on our assessment of your personal information to try to ensure that you are getting the benefit of the best possible products and services from us.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>To help us improve our products and services, including customer services, and develop and market new products and services</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may, from time to time, use personal information provided by you through your use of the services and/or through client feedback forms to help us improve our products and services. It is in our legitimate interests to use your personal information in this way to try to ensure the highest standards when providing you with our products and services and to continue to be a market leader in the financial services industry.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>To form a profile about you</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may, from time to time, use personal information provided by you through your use of the services and/or through client surveys to help us improve our products and services. It is in our legitimate interests to use your personal information in this way to try to ensure the highest standards when providing you with our products and services and to continue to be a market leader in the financial services industry.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>To investigate or settle enquiries or disputes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may need to use personal information collected from you to investigate issues or to settle disputes with you because it is in our legitimate interests to ensure that issues and disputes get investigated and resolved in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>To comply with applicable laws, court orders, other judicial process, or the requirements of any applicable regulatory authorities</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may need to use your personal information to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, court orders or other judicial process, or the requirements of any applicable regulatory authority. We do this not only to comply with our legal obligations but because it may also be in our legitimate interest to do so.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>Data analysis</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our website pages and e-mails may contain web beacons or pixel tags or any other similar type of data analysis tools that allow us to track receipt of correspondence and count the number of users that have visited our webpage or opened our correspondence. We may aggregate your personal information (such as trading history) with the personal information of our other clients on an anonymous basis (that is, with your personal identifiers removed) so that more rigorous statistical analysis of general patterns may lead to us providing better products and services</p>
<p>If your personal information is completely anonymised, we do not require a legal basis as the information will no longer constitute personal information. If your personal information is not in an anonymised form, it is in our legitimate interest to continually evaluate that personal information to ensure that the products and services we provide are relevant to the market.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li><strong>Marketing purposes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may use your personal information to send you marketing communications by email or phone or other agreed forms (including social media campaigns) to ensure that you are always kept up to date with our latest products and services. If we send you marketing communications we will either do so based on your consent or if it is in our legitimate interest. We will not disclose your information to any outside parties for the purpose of allowing them to directly market to you. You always have the right to change your option if you no longer wish to receive such communications</p>
<ol start="14">
<li><strong>Internal business purposes and record keeping</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may need to process your personal information for internal business and research purposes as well as for record keeping purposes. Such processing is in our own legitimate interests and is required in order to comply with our legal obligations. This may include any communications that we have with you in relation to the services and products we provide to you and our relationship with you. We will also keep records to ensure that you comply with your contractual obligations pursuant to the agreement governing our relationship with you.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li><strong>Legal Notifications</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Often the law requires us to advise you of certain changes to products or services or laws. We may need to inform you of changes to the terms or the features of our products or services. We need to process your personal information to send you these legal notifications. You will continue to receive this information from us even if you choose not to receive direct marketing information from us.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li><strong>Physical security</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you enter any of our premises we may record your image on our CCTV for security reasons. We may also take your details to keep a record of who has entered our premises on any given day. It is in our legitimate interest to do this to maintain a safe and secure working environment.</p>
