Our use of Cookies

Many Web sites now use "cookies" to provide useful features to their visitors by providing customizable and personalized services. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. For example, a Web site may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you, your preferences, or the pages you last visited. Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies, or to ask you if you would like to accept or decline a cookie from a particular site before it is set. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the Help section of the toolbar. You should know, however, that if you reject a cookie, certain functions and conveniences of a site may not work properly. We use cookies on our Web site to store and sometimes track visitor preferences. We will not link the cookie to any of your personal information.

Our Children’s Privacy Policy

Our site does not feature information and services of interest to children 13 years and under, and we do not collect personal information from anyone we know is a child under 13.

Some of the features on this Web site may require registration and the disclosure of some personal information, which may include a specialized registration process for certain programs and events.

Links to Other Sites

Web sites often provide a number of links that offer direct access to other useful or interesting Web sites holding potential value to site visitors.

Users are encouraged to review the privacy policy of each linked site before sharing personal information.

This site includes links to non-affiliated external Web sites. We encourage users to review the privacy policy of each linked site, as we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.
