# Hyster Sisters Privacy Policy | HysterSisters

We respect your privacy

Any personal information you give to the HysterSisters website (the Website) will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented. A more detailed explanation about how we safeguard your personal information is described below. Personal information is information about a person that includes identifying information about that person.

***We do not actively submit pages with usernames to search engines, but they are picked up by a number of them. If you have a username that is your actual full name, it may be possible to search for your name and find it affiliated with HysterSisters. This is why, during registration, we warn members *not* to register with an identifiable username. We have no control over search engine results.

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy as necessary. If we change this Privacy Policy then it will be updated accordingly here on this Website. We recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are aware of any changes.

The HysterSisters Website does not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any personal information collected at our site, including email lists. Special offers from sponsors may be offered during registration and your email may be shared for the purpose of sending the requested information to you.

HysterSisters does occasionally engage in research initiatives related to women's health. The sole purpose of these research initiatives is to identify unmet needs of women through aggregate reporting of women's experiences, opinions and therapeutic treatments.

Research is typically conducted through opt-in survey where survey response data is summarized, reported in the aggregate and made available for purchase to various constituents in the medical community who need to hear the voice of women. These constituents include, but are not limited to: doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors.

In addition to research conducted from opt-in survey response data, textural data you provide in your posts may be summarized and reported at a non-personal, aggregate level on a periodic basis for the purpose of identifying trends in consumer education and opinion.

Neither of the aforementioned forms of data collection for research purposes retain or report on any personal information.

The HysterSisters Website analyzes our Website logs to constantly improve the value of the materials available on the Website. Our Website logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that actually browse the site.

The HysterSisters Website maintains an email list to keep HysterSisters members informed about breaking events. Members select to be updated via email by the administration of HysterSisters during registration. Checking "no" to "receiving email from admin" in your member's control panel will opt you out of receiving newsletter emails from this site. In addition, we configure our message board software to refuse to divulge the email addresses of our members to anyone.
