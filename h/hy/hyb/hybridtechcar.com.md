Where we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we will obtain consent where required as described in more detail below. Where ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they have obtained.

    * Tell our ad partners how their hybridtechcar.com ads are doing, and how to make them better. Some of this information is aggregated. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Promoted Pin went on to visit that advertiser’s site. In other instances, this information isn’t aggregated. For example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular Promoted Pin has been saved by certain people. To find out more about reporting on Promoted Pins, please visit the Help Center.

    * Tell our ad partners the types of products you might be interested in. For example, if you create a board dedicated to sneakers, we can tell a retailer that you’re more interested in sneakers than, say, sweaters. This helps us and our ad partners to make sure that the content and ads you see are relevant to you.

We have a legitimate interest in using information we collect to customize your hybridtechcar.com experience based on your offsite behavior. For example, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar Pins to you. When we identify your interests based on your offsite behavior with cookies, we will obtain any consent we may need. To find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookies Policy.

In addition to the specific circumstances above, we’ll only use your information with your consent in order to:

    * Send you marketing materials by email, text or push notification, depending on your account or operating system settings. Each time we send you marketing materials, we give you the option to unsubscribe.

    * Identify your location and customize the content we show you. For example, if we know that you are based in San Francisco, we could show you Pins of local products. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.

    * Allow searching with photos. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.

    * Tell our ad partners how their ads are doing using the hybridtechcar.com tag. The hybridtechcar.com tag (a piece of code) delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on hybridtechcar.com. To learn more about the http://hybridtechcar.com/ , please visit the Help Center.

We’ll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to:

    * Identify you across different browser sessions. This means if you log into hybridtechcar.com t from your phone (or any device), we’ll remember that you’re you and you won’t need to enter your login details each time you visit hybridtechcar.com

    * Show you ads you might be interested in. We use cookies to identify your interests based on your offsite behavior. We do this for existing users and for new users, and it helps us customize the new user experience.

To find out more about how we use cookies, and your choices about how we use them, please see our Cookies Policy.

We take additional measures when information is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA). This includes having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA.

  * Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information. If you have a hybridtechcar.com account, many of the choices you have on hybridtechcar.com are built directly into hybridtechcar.com or your settings. For example, you can:

For more information about secret boards, please visit our Help Center.

    * Choose whether hybridtechcar.com will be customized for you using information from other websites or apps.

We also share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by third party providers on our behalf.

    * Law enforcement agencies or government agencies. We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or hybridtechcar.com ; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

    * Our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates.
