# Privacy Policy | Hybrid Cars

Published March 2, 2006

Our privacy policy is in plain English and will only take a few moments to read and understand.

### How You Can Contact Us

We can be reached via e-mail using our [Feedback Form](https://web.archive.org/contact/), or by sending mail directly to [info@hybridcars.com](mailto:info@hybridcars.com).

### Site Tracking

We have a simple web statistics program running that tracks how many times each page is visited. When you visit a page, information is logged that contains your domain name (aol.com, for example), date, time, and pages visited. There is no personally identifiable information. The information we collect is:

  * Used to improve the content on our site
  * Never shared with other organizations for commercial purposes



### Email Addresses

We log your email address in these situations:

Newsletter – We keep track of email addresses when people sign up for our newsletter. The email address you enter for the newsletter will never be sold or transferred to any other organization. You have the ability to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. The form for subscribing and unsubscribing to the newsletter are available [on this site](https://web.archive.org/web/20110602200801id_/http%3A//www.hybridcars.com/newsletter.html) and are included in every email that is sent out.

Email Page to a Friend - We log each time someone uses this feature to track how many times it is used, by whom, and from what page. We do this to make sure that someone doesn't abuse the feature by sending multiple emails from the site to the same person. The information is discarded monthly and will never be sold or transferred to any other organization.

If for any reason you receive an email from us and you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending e-mail to [info@hybridcars.com](mailto:info@hybridcars.com).
