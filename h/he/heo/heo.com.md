We are happy to have you as a visitor to our web site and happy for your interest in our products. That is why we take protecting your privacy and the personal data you provide us very seriously. It goes without saying that we abide by the regulations in the German data protection and privacy law. 

In the following we inform you of what data we may collect and what we do with that information. 

**What personal data is collected and processed?**   
We do not require any personal data from you in order for you to visit our web site. We only receive the name of your Internet service provider, the web site from which you are visiting us and the individual pages you visit at our web site. Personal data is only collected and processed when you want to place an order on the web site. 

**For what purpose is personal data collected and processed?**   
Since we are always striving to improve our service offerings in a continuous process, not only for our customers but for our agency as well, the general data listed above is evaluated statistically. In general, when you use one of our services, the only data collected is the data we require to provide the service. When we request additional information, the additional information is voluntary, not mandatory. The personal data is only processed so that we can provide the service requested and protect our own legitimate business interests. 

**Is personal data passed to third parties?**   
We will not disclose, transfer, sell or otherwise market your personal information to other companies or institutions as long as you have not provided an explicit declaration of consent. However, we will disclose and pass on data when required to do so by law or when a court verdict has obligated us to do so. 

**Use of Cookies**   
We use (session)cookies in some areas of our web site. Cookies are used for identification purposes so that we can customize the services we offer you during your visit. We do not use cookies to collect personal data. If you would like to be informed of the use of cookies by your browser, then you should activate the corresponding browser settings. 

**Security**   
We have taken technical and organizational measures to protect the data you have provided us from loss, damage, manipulation and unauthorized access. All our employees and third parties participating in the processing of the data are required to follow the German data privacy and protection laws and to handle such personal data confidentially. 

We reserve the right to change this declaration at any time. It does not form the foundation for any contractual or other formal rights with respect to or on the authority of a party. ©
