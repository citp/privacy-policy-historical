Fiserv Inc. ("Fiserv") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the information you provide to us through this Web site. We do not sell or distribute user information to third parties. We gather user information and will distribute this information within Fiserv in order to serve your needs and respond to your information requests. These are the guidelines we use in protecting your privacy.

  1. **Gathering of User Information.** We collect information about our Web visitors indirectly through our Internet access logs. When you access Fiserv.com, EPSIIA.com or EDD.Fiserv.com, your browser's domain name and Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. We use this information to learn about which pages and information our Web site visitors access and how often. We also collect user information when you voluntarily submit it to us. Throughout our site, we provide the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail alerts regarding Fiserv events or company news, to request company information, or to request solution, product, or service information through an e-mail contact form. When we collect this type of information, we intend to use the information to determine how we can meet your needs and respond to your requests. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide this information. 
  2. **Use of Cookies.** The Fiserv EDD web site only minimally uses cookies to assign a "User I.D.". Cookies are small files of information, which save specific information about your visit. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number and are used only to assist in producing overall site visitor statistics. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Unless you specifically tell us who you are by completing a contact form, we will never know who you are even though we assign you a cookie. If you are uncomfortable regarding the use of cookies, you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in preferences or options menu in your browser. 
  3. **Disclosure of User Information.** Fiserv will not sell or distribute user information to third- parties. If you have voluntarily submitted user information to us through an e-mail or contact form, EPSIIA maintains your security by ensuring the information is only distributed within Fiserv. This enables us to respond to your request about a product or service. If you subscribe to an e-mail list, you will be given instructions on how to remove yourself from that list. 
  4. **External Links.** The Fiserv web site provides links to other third party web sites. Even if the third party is affiliated with Fiserv through a business partnership or otherwise, Fiserv is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices or the content of such external links. These links are provided to you for convenience purposes only, and you access them at your own risk.
