Your privacy is important to Hetzner and we are committed to protecting it. 

  * Personally Identifiable Information

  * Your Access To Information



**Personally Identifiable Information**

Hetzner does not share, disclose or sell any personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or email address) collected online on Hetzner sites with third parties for non-Hetzner marketing purposes. 

In the unlikely event that Hetzner should decide to share such data with third parties for marketing in future, it will provide notification and the opportunity for its users to indicate whether they would prefer that the Company not provide such information about them to third parties. 

Because this information is a critical part of our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding. 

Hetzner also does not market to, or knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16 on Company sites. 

**How We Use Information**

Hetzner uses the personally-identifiable information we collect online principally to provide you with the service(s) you have ordered and to make service announcements from time to time. 

Postal and e-mail address information, for example, enables communication about services offered and ordered, as well as the proper provisioning and billing of those services. 

Like most businesses, Hetzner uses professional and reputable vendors to carry out certain functions (such as processing recurring debit order collections) and so shares online data to the extent necessary for them to perform their work. Of course, such vendors must use that personally-identifiable information only for the purpose(s) for which it was shared and protect it from any further use. Hetzner may also share such information with other industry and credit-related organizations to improve operations and to protect against fraud, security and credit risks. 

We also provide personally-identifiable online information in response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with Hetzner property or services, or with our customers' or others' use of them. 

**How We Collect Information**

Hetzner collects information online by asking you for it, for example, when you order a service or respond to a survey. A customer's name, address (postal and e-mail) and telephone number are the most important pieces of information, but we might request other information, based on, for example, the service(s) being ordered or promoted. 

If you choose to pay for your service(s) by debit order, we will request your banking details to include in periodic debit order transactions. 

Hetzner may also use "cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites or your responses to e-mail from us - both individually and in aggregated data that does not identify you. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our web sites or e-mails in which you showed an interest or took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness of our sites. At Hetzner , we primarily use cookies to determine what services or promotions you are interested in. While cookies help us improve your experience while visiting our sites and customize our communications to the services you may desire, you have the option to block them through your Internet browser or other commercially available software. However, doing so may make some of our sites' features unavailable to you. 

**Security**

We use encryption, firewalls and other technology and security procedures to help protect the accuracy and security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access or improper use. For example, you will note that while using some features of the Hetzner web sites and online services, you will need to submit a password or some other type of authenticating information. 

**Your Access To Information**

You may review or update the available personally identifiable information that we received from you online by accessing your account online, by contacting our Help Desk or e-mail address on your invoice, or through the Company contact information below. Please note that in order to better protect you and safeguard your information, we take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to your information. 

Hetzner may use e-mail addresses you provide us online on Hetzner sites to send you e-mail related to Hetzner products and services or if you have affirmatively indicated a desire to receive additional information. To be excluded from further email communications, activate the opt-out facility in "My Account" and we will respect your wishes.
