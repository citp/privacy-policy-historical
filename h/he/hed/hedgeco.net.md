# Privacy Policy

  
We appreciate your interest in HedgeCo.Net (“Site”). We at HedgeCo, LLC ("HedgeCo"), recognize and appreciate the importance of respecting the privacy of our customers and are committed to safeguarding against unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal information of our customers. This Privacy Policy sets forth HedgeCo's current policies and practices with respect to nonpublic personal information of our customers. **By using this Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.**

**WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED**

 _Personal Information_  
We only collect the personally identifiable information that you provide to us.

If you register for certain Services on this Site, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information as part of the registration process, such as first and last name, e-mail address, telephone number. In addition, in using the Services, you may be asked to provide additional information about the hedge funds that you represent or manage.

We may use personally identifiable information in order to develop, offer, and deliver products and services; respond to inquiries from you or your representative; or to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. HedgeCo may collect nonpublic personal information about you from any of the following sources:

1\. From you or your representative on applications, registrations, or other forms (for example, your name, address, assets and income); 

2\. From you or your representative regarding your preferences (for example, based on your activity on our website); 

3\. From other sources with your consent or with the consent of your representative (for example, from other institutions such as credit reporting agencies); 

4\. From investment activity (for example, your investments in private placements); 

5\. From other interactions with HedgeCo (for example, discussions with our customer service staff or your entry of information into our interactive tools). 

6\. From email correspondence from you (we may gather the information in a file specific to you). 

_Non-Personal Information_  
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Site. This information includes the type of Internet browser and operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, the URL that you visited before you came to our Site, the URL to which you next go, and your IP (Internet Protocol) address, pages visited, and average time spent on our Site. This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve our Site design and functionality. When you use the contact features of the Site, you consent to the review and internal use of your communication by HedgeCo. We also may use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate to analyze Site usage and to gather broad demographic information. _Cookies_  
Like most major websites, HedgeCo uses cookies on our Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while visiting a Site. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the Site remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities on our Site, and which allows you to enter your password/log in ID less frequently while visiting our Site. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information although cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Site to personally identifying information that you previously submitted. For example, it enables us to enhance personalization on the Site, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site. We will always give you the choice of opting out of receiving a cookie by checking the appropriate box. However, if you decide to opt out, your use of the Site may be slowed because you will have to enter your log in ID and password at every session. 

**HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION**
