## Privacy and cookies

This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.

This privacy statement only covers Health Education England and LETB websites. It does not cover all sites that can be linked to from this site, so you should always be aware when you are moving to another site and read the privacy statement on that site.

**What information do we collect?**

From time to time, you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g.name and email address) in order to receive or use services on our website. Such services include bulletins, email updates, website feedback.

By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable HEE, its LETBs and its service providers to provide you with the services you select. Any information you provide to HEE or a LETB will only be used by us, our agents and service providers and will not be disclosed unless we are obliged or permitted to by law to do so.

If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on the HEE or LETB websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on the website, we may use whatever information is available to us, about you, to stop such behaviour. We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met or when you no longer wish to continue your subscription.

**The Data Protection Act**

Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.  
We do not pass on your details to any third party or other government department.

**Changes to our policy**

If our privacy policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing the page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.

The HEE and LETB websites contain links to and from websites of government departments and other organisations. This privacy policy applies only to HEE and its LETBs.

**Following a link to another website**

When you go to another website, read the privacy policy on that website if you want to know what it does with your information. HEE and its LETBs do not pass on any of your personal information to other websites.

**Following a link to HEE or a LETB from another website**

When you come to the HEE or LETB websites from another website, HEE  and its LETBs may get personal information about you from the other website. You should read the privacy policy of websites you visit that link you to HEE or its LETBs if you want to know about this.

These policies will explain how they collect and use your personal information, and whether they pass this on to websites they link you to.

**Social networking websites**

The HEE and LETB websites have buttons at the bottom of website pages so you can use social networking websites (eg Facebook and Twitter) with the HEE or LETB websites. These websites are not controlled by HEE or itsLETBs. By using these buttons you accept the privacy policies of these websites.

**Social bookmarking**

Social bookmarks are a way of saving links to web pages that interest you, and sharing those links with other people.

Social bookmarking websites are free to use, but you will need to register with them to start bookmarking.

**To use a social bookmarking website, you need to:**

  * register with a social bookmarking website
  * find a web page you like
  * save the link to the social bookmarking website, which stores it
  * add words or ‘tags’ to the link to explain what the page is about



You can then visit the social bookmarking website whenever and from wherever you want, and view the bookmarked links you have saved or shared. You will also be able to look at other people’s bookmarks and comments, and they will be able to view yours.

Social bookmarking websites all work in different ways and you may prefer to use one or many. It’s worth having a look at the different websites before you decide which one you want to use. You can register with as many as you like.

The social media and social bookmarking services that HEE and its LETBs link to are third party websites. HEE and its LETBs do not have any control over the way that these websites use your data.

You should read their respective privacy policies carefully to find out what happens to any data that these services collect when you use them.

**Use of cookies**

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

**These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:**

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast
  * analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with govt services so we can make them better
