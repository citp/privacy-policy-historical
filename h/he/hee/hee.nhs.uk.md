# Privacy and cookies | Health Education England

This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website or participate in any HEE sponsored training education and development (hereafter ‘training’)

* * *

### HEE’s role in the NHS

HEE is here to improve the quality of healthcare for the people and patients of England through education, training and lifelong development of staff. HEE aims to enable high quality, effective, compassionate care and to identify the right people with  
the right skills and the right values. All of the information we collect is to support these objectives.

### What this privacy statement covers

This privacy statement only covers HEE’s websites and services. It does not cover all sites that can be linked to from this site, so you should always be aware when you are moving to another site and read the privacy statement on that site.

If our privacy policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing the page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.

### The information we collect

From time to time, you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g.name and email address) in order to receive or use services such as training, bulletins, email updates and website feedback.

We collect personal information from you so that we can provide education and training to you, for clinical professional learner recruitment, to promote our services, to monitor our own accounts and records, to monitor our work, to report on progress made, and to let us fulfil our statutory obligations and statutory returns as set by health and the law. In order to achieve these objectives HEE will use information for the following purposes:

  * Managing the provision of training programmes;
  * Managing processes allied to training programmes such as certification and evidence, such as revalidation, supporting the requirements of regulators;
  * Quality assurance of training programmes;
  * Workforce Planning;
  * Improving patient safety;
  * Compliance with legal and regulatory responsibilities, including monitoring under the Equality Act 2010.
  * Research associated with each of the purposes described above



### How we protect and use your personal data

All personal data we collect from you complies with the data protection principles, as stated in the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) in line with Health Education England’s DPA registration held within the Information Commissioners Office. For a full list please check HEE’s registration number: [ZA005728 held within the ICO’s website](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/DoSearch)

The personal data we collect may be held as an electronic record on data systems managed by HEE or as a paper record. These records are only accessed and seen by staff who need access to personal data so they can do their jobs and other partner organisations under data sharing agreements. The security of the data follows HEE’s policies on information governance management.

We make every effort to keep your personal information accurate. If you tell us of any changes in your circumstances, we can update the records with personal data you choose to share with us.  
We will keep personal data for no longer than necessary, in line with the NHS records retention schedule, within the NHS records management code of practice.

### Sharing personal data

So we can provide the right services at the right level, we may share your personal data within services across HEE to provide the best possible training and education – this will be on a legitimate need to know basis only.

### Open Data

HEE policy is to observe the Cabinet Office transparency and accountability commitments towards more open use of public data in line with relevant and applicable UK and European legislation. HEE would never share personal data through the Open Data facility. To this end, HEE will implement Information Governance protocols that reflect Information Commissioner’s Office recommended best practice for record anonymisation, and Office of National Statistics guidance on publication of statistical information.

### Your rights

You have the right to ask HEE stop processing your personal data in relation to any HEE service. However, this may prevent HEE providing the best possible service to you. Where possible, we will do as you ask, however we may need to hold and process your data already in our possession so that we comply with NHS retention and legal requirements.

If you find that personal data that we hold is no longer accurate, you have the right to have this corrected. Please contact the service holding your data to do this.

## Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally. These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast
  * analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with government services so we can make them better



You can manage these small files and learn more about them from the article, [Internet Browser cookies – what they are and how to manage them](https://www.gov.uk/help/cookies).
