_http://www.heebmagazine.comSite Visitorship Data_

Site Visitorship Data is information about the way a website is used that is not associated with an individual’s identity. We use aggregate anonymous data regarding online behavior to better understand how people use our website. To that end, we may use aggregated, anonymous online traffic behavior along with information from third parties to track usage trends and thereby improve our website. We may also use this aggregated, anonymous information to develop reports that we may share with third party marketing partners and customers. The kind of information we may collect includes:

  * your Internet Protocol (IP) address;
  * the pages visited on our site;
  * the links clicked on our site;
  * any products or services you review;
  * the features used;
  * how long a visitor stays; and
  * the domain name of the site from which visitors connect to our site and the site to which visitors connect through our service.



Most Site Visitorship Data is collected using data collection tools such as web beacons, cookies, embedded web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools.  We use Site Visitorship Data to develop, manage, and improve the website.  Sometimes we may aggregate Site Visitorship Data with personally identifiable information from registered members.  We may use that information to:

  * manage the website;
  * help resolve problems
  * analyze use of the site; and
  * notify you about products or services that we, our third party marketing partners, and members may offer from time-to-time.



Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Heeb decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personally identifiable information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

**Information Security**

We may recommend or require the use of encryption technologies for certain types of communications conducted through this website. While we may provide those technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not guarantee that information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions will be free from delay, interruption, interception or error.

**Disclosure of Information**

Heeb will not release any personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except as follows:

  1. Anyone providing us their personally identifiable information grants Heeb and its affiliates, the right to use their information internally without restrictions for the purposes of, but not limited to, research, marketing, and content and lead development.
  2. Heeb may share information we collect with our third party marketing partners. If we do so, we will request that they treat this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to refrain from disclosing or using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than for the provision of services to you or for the benefit of Heeb. Our third party marketing partners may also send you special promotions and offers for related services, at their sole discretion.
  3. We may disclose information collected on this site, including personally identifiable information, to third parties as required or permitted by law. For example, we may disclose information: 
    * to regulators;

    * to vendors who provide us with service; or
    * to companies that may acquire part or all of an affiliated company.
