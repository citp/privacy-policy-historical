If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us using the details given at the end of this statement.

Clearly, the better that we know you, the better that we can tailor our services to meet your needs, but we will limit the collection and use of your information to the minimum required to deliver, develop and improve our services to you, which includes advising you about our products, services and other opportunities and administering our business.

We reserve the right to contact you via post, e-mail or telephone solely in relation to the administration of your account.

## How do we protect your information?

When you register for our services, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts the information (e.g. credit card details) that you input before it is transmitted to us. In addition we have strict security and confidentiality procedures covering the storage and disclosure of your information in order to safeguard it, to prevent unauthorised access and to comply with the UK Data Protection Act 1998. Specifically, we shall permit only authorised employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy are subject to our usual disciplinary procedures.

Whenever we hire other organisations to provide support services, as agents or contractors, we shall require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.

## What else should you know about your privacy?

The information that you post on message boards is visible to the public. Please remember that, whenever you disclose personal information publicly, that information can be collected and used by others. If you post personal information online, that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. If you do not want strangers to send you e-mail, do not post your e-mail address on a message board.

Furthermore, while we do our best to protect your personal information, Hemscott cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
