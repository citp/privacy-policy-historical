** ** NEW JERSEY HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT ASSISTANCE AUTHORITY

NOTICE OF PRIVACY POLICY 

The New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority's (HESAA) mission includes, in part, providing New Jersey students and families with financial resources such as loans, grants, scholarships and college savings programs to assist students in achieving their education goals. 

Protecting the privacy of your personal information is important to us at HESAA. We respect your right to privacy and recognize our obligation to keep information about you secure and confidential. We do not sell or share information about you with outside marketers.

Federal legislation requires us to provide you with this notice about our privacy policy. The law also requires us to issue you this notice each year that you are our customer.

This Notice uses the term “nonpublic personal information.” This means personal information about you which identifies you, and that is not available from public sources.

 _ **HESAA's Privacy Policy**_

  1. We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

•Information we receive from you on loan applications, promissory notes, NJBEST account applications, correspondence, communications and other forms;

•Information about your transactions with us or others with respect to your student loan from parties such as your lender(s) and the U.S. Department of Education and their agents;

•Information received from schools you attend or formerly attended, or to which you have applied for admission; and

•Information received from credit reporting agencies.

  2. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you or our other current or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law (we do share such information with our contractors and agents, and to schools, lenders and the U.S. Department of Education, as needed, to administer our programs in conformity with applicable laws and regulations).
  3. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to our employees, contractors, and agents who need to know the information in order to provide service to you, such as servicing and recordkeeping for your account, and collecting your student loan. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with federal regulations to safeguard your nonpublic personal information.   




HESAA's Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as necessary to reflect changes in the law or HESAA's policies. As changes are made, you will receive a revised Notice.

Rev. 10/0
