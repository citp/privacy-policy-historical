## Transfers of personal information abroad

In order to deliver our services to you, we sometimes need to share your personal information with parties outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We'll always ensure that any transfers of this nature are fully compliant with European Union data protection laws governing transfers of personal information outside the EEA, so that your personal information is secure.

Some countries outside the EEA have been recognized by The European Union as having appropriate laws and safeguards protecting personal data, known as Adequate Jurisdictions, so that personal information may be freely transferred to them. The current list of these countries is Andorra, Argentina, Canada (commercial organisations), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay and the USA (limited to the privacy shield framework). Personal information may also be transferred to countries not recognized as Adequate Jurisdictions, provided we inform you of the absence of appropriate safeguards to personal data in that country and you give your explicit consent to the proposed transfer. If we need to transfer your personal information to one of these countries, we will inform you in a clear, concise and transparent manner and will only make the transfer when you have given us explicit consent to do so.

## Other parties in connection with a corporate transaction:

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.

## With your consent or at your direction:

In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.

We also may share other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example, aggregated data about how users are using our Services.

## Changes to our privacy policy

We may modify or revise our privacy policy from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to this privacy policy, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at <http://www.hegre.com/privacy> so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

If we change anything in our privacy policy, the date of change will be reflected in the “last updated date”. You agree that you will periodically review this privacy policy and refresh the page when doing so. You agree to note the date of the last revision to our privacy policy. If the “last updated” date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed our privacy policy, then it is unchanged. On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review our privacy policy, and you agree to the new ones.

All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the website thereafter. The updated version of our privacy policy supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect. If you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones. You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission. By continuing to use the website subsequent to us making available an amended version of our privacy policy, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment.
