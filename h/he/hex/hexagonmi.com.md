## Privacy Policy

**Introduction**  
Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence ("COMPANY," "us" or "we" as appropriate) is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our web site and all pages operated by COMPANY accessed directly or indirectly by links contained within the site (collectively, the "Site"). This privacy statement explains data collection and use practices of the Site and in connection with services accessed through the Site (the "Service(s)").

**Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy**  
Throughout the COMPANY Privacy Policy we use several specialized terms. “Personally Identifiable Information” is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, title and company or organization name or phone number. “User Information” means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in the COMPANY Privacy Policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user’s computer.

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
If you communicate with us, we may collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide, including if applicable, your user ID and password, which we may elect to provide for you. If you communicate with us to engage in a transaction such as receiving information about Company products and services, ordering e-mail newsletters, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing, downloading and/or registering Company products, then we also may collect and store information about the transaction. If you send us communications, we may collect such communications in a file specific to you.

We will not use Personally Identifiable Information except as described in this Privacy Policy. The Personally Identifiable Information collected on this Site may be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to improve our products and services.

When we communicate with you regarding a Product or Service you request, we may use Personally Identifiable Information to communicate with you via mail, email, phone or in any other way enabled by information you provide. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you with information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Company products and services, and/or share information with Company partners so they may send you information about their products and services.

When you sign up for a newsletter or agree to receive promotional e-mail, we may use customized links or similar technologies to track e-mail links that you click. We may associate that information with your Personally Identifiable Information in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are small text files that our Site can send to your browser for storage on your hard drive. Cookies can make your use of our Site easier by saving your status and preferences upon visits to our Site. We may use cookies for two purposes: (1) to enable the Site to customize some of its information for your convenience, such as "remembering" the language you selected; and (2) in some instances, to associate you with your Personally Identifiable Information. For example, through the use of cookies we may provide a service so that you can login automatically without the need to type a user name or password. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to logon to the Site or fully use all features of the Site or other Web sites you visit.

**Web Beacons**  
The Site may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow us to count users who have visited certain web pages and to deliver co-branded services. COMPANY may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views. COMPANY prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your Personally Identifiable Information. 

**Public Forums**  
Information posted to newsgroups, chats, or other public forums may be made available to other members of those forums and is therefore considered by us to be public information to which this privacy policy does not apply. You should be cautious about posting a real e-mail address or other personally identifiable information to newsgroups, chats, or other public forums.

**Your Choice To Opt Out**  
If you do not want to provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information, you may opt out by not using the Service that provides us with such Personally Identifiable Information. For example, if you do not want us to retain your name, then you may choose not to become a registered user, not to send us a communication, or not to purchase products through the Site. You will not be entitled to the benefits of registration or a response to the communication, but you are still free to browse the Site.

If you enter your e-mail address into any field in the Site, we will interpret that action as your affirmative consent to receive e-mail messages from us and affiliated parties with whom we may share information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to request that we not send you further communications of that type.

Users who no longer wish to receive our notices or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the communication.

**Onward Transfer of Information**  
Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Personally Identifiable Information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of Company and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.  We may share Personally Identifiable Information with our partners, affiliates and joint ventures that are committed to serving your need for the Services. We only share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties who have provided us with assurances that they will abide by the standards of this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, we may need to disclose Personally Identifiable Information to law enforcement or other government officials if required to do so by law.

Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Company or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any transfer of information outside of your country for storage and/or processing.

**Miscellaneous**  
COMPANY may from time to time change the COMPANY Privacy Policy with or without notice, so please check it regularly for any changes or updates. If you do not agree with any of these terms herein, please do not use this site or submit any Personally Identifiable Information. This English version shall always prevail in case of conflicts between it and any translations of the COMPANY Privacy Policy.
