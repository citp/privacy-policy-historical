# Hogwarts Extreme : An Interactive Harry Potter RPG Website

Hogwarts Extreme fully respects the privacy of its users and pledges to continually protect it by using the best means of technology available. This policy is provided as an informational tool for everyone. Please contact us if you have any questions through the "Contact" link located at the bottom of every page. 

**Operators / Contacting**

Hogwarts Extreme is ran by people across the world through electronic means. Therefore, means of contacting us can be achieved by clicking "Contact" at the very bottom of any page on Hogwarts Extreme. Also, you may view everyone that is currently running Hogwarts Extreme on the [About Us](https://web.archive.org/aboutus.php) page. The About Us page is always kept up to date with the latest staff information. 

**Information We Collect**

We collect the following : 

\- Email Address   
\- First Name   
\- Date of Birth   
\- Location (can be just country)   
\- Gender   
\- IP Address 

**How We Use the Information**

Your email address is not displayed to any users, but simply used for verification in the event a password is forgotten. Occasional emails will also be sent out to all users to give everyone a general site update/status. In order to protect a child under the age of 13, we collect everyone's date of birth so we may prevent your child by means of PHP coding from accessing parts of the site that might be inappropriate. The age of every user on the website is displayed on the user info page, and forum posts for general informational purposes for other users. First names and locations are displayed in user infos, and also are a tool for us to see where our users are coming from. IP addresses are logged to protect everyone on the site. In the event a user is causing a large problem, the IP of the user will be reported to the appropriate authorities to keep the users of Hogwarts Extreme safe. 

**How You Can Control Your Personal Information**

Everything can be readily updated by you at anytime except date of birth and gender. Since your date of birth will never change and your gender will most likely stay the same, we do not let anyone readily change them. If you accidentally selected a wrong option during registration, simply contact us via the "Contact Link" or by using the "Owl System" to reach a staff member to have it changed. 

**Third Party Disclosing**

Hogwarts Extreme will never disclose any information to any third parties. All information is heavily encrypted so all information will be protected. 

**Links to Other Sites**

Links to other websites exist on Hogwarts Extreme and can mostly be found under "Links" on the navigation bar, and in the upper right hand corner of every page. It is your responsibility to understand that these links will exit you from Hogwarts Extreme entirely, meaning we are no longer responsible. 

**Parents**

Please view our [COPPA Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20061113202202id_/http%3A//www.hexrpg.com/terms.php?view=coppa) for information. 

**Updating of this Policy**

If this policy is modified, a news post will be made on the main page or an asterisk will be put next to the link to this policy. It is your responsibility to notice these notifications.
