# Privacy Policy

Hexcel Corporation is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to its Web site. This Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions of Use describe the information collected by Hexcel.com, how that information is used by Hexcel and the terms and conditions of your use of this site. We encourage you to read both of these policies carefully before using this site.

**In General**

You can visit our Web site without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Hexcel monitors user traffic patterns throughout the site according to a user's domain name, browser type, date and time of access and pages viewed. Our Web servers collect the domain names but not the e-mail addresses of visitors. This information is collected in order to measure the number of visitors to our site and to determine which areas of the site users find useful based upon the amount of traffic to particular areas. Hexcel uses this information to enhance the user experience when visiting our site and to better prepare future content based on the interests of users. 

On occasion a visitor to our Web site may be asked to provide personal information (eg. when completing our inquiry form). In most cases, personal information is used only to respond to inquiries. Hexcel will not provide e-mail addresses or other visitor information to any non-Hexcel organization or partner without your approval, unless we are required to do so by law, government inquiry or other legal proceedings. In some instances, Hexcel may set up links to non-Hexcel controlled Web sites. However, Hexcel does not control such third-party Web sites and cannot be responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

Our job search function is managed externally by SuccessFactors and any personal information that you submit on an application form will be treated in the strictest confidence and shared only between SuccessFactors and Hexcel.  View the SuccessFactors Privacy policy at the following link <http://www.successfactors.com/privacy/>.
