Additionally, we will not (i) disclose, or (ii) use for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you, any Personal Information that reveals details about your health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or sexual orientation, unless you have given us express permission to do so or unless permitted by law.

##### Onward Transfers

When we transfer Personal Information to third party agents, we will comply with the Privacy Shield notice principle, ascertain that the third party agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principles, and enter into a contract with the third party agent that provides that: (1) the third party agent will process the Personal Information only for limited and specified purposes, (2) the third party agent will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principles; (3) Hexcel will take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the third party agent effectively processes the Personal Information pursuant to the Privacy Shield privacy principles; (4) the third party agent will notify us if the third party agent can no longer provide the same level of privacy protection as required by the Privacy Shield principles; and, (5) upon such notice by the third party agent, we will take steps to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing.

When we transfer Personal Information to third party controllers, we will comply with the Privacy Shield notice and choice principles and enter into a contract with the third party controller that provides that (1) such Personal Information may be processed only for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the individual; (2) the third party controller will provide the same level of protections as the Privacy Shield principles; (3) the third party controller will notify us if the third party can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection for the Personal Information as required by the Privacy Shield principles; and (4) upon such notice by the third party controller, the third party controller will cease processing the Personal Information and/or take reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate any unauthorized processing.

In the context of an onward transfer of Personal Information, we have responsibility for the processing of Personal Information we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party agent. We will remain liable under the Privacy Shield principles if our third party agent processes such Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
