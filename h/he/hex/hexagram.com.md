We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to our Group company in the United States of America (“USA”), Hexagram Advertising Exchange (“Hexagram”), in order to perform our contract with you, for day to day business activities, recruitment purposes (in the case of job applicants) and for auditing purposes. Such information may be hosted on our Cloud system provider and accessed by Hexagram on a business need to know basis.

5\. There is an adequacy decision by the European Commission in respect of the USA (limited to the safeguards set out in the Privacy Shield). This means that the USA is deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal information.

6\. Any transfers to the USA will be subject to the safeguards set out in the Privacy Shield.

7\. We will only transfer such personal data as we believe is necessary for the purposes of hosting the data on our Cloud provider and for auditing processes (or other purposes specified above); and

We will ensure any data processed by Hexagram is only processed by those individuals who require the data on a need to know basis

**RETENTION**

In terms of retention periods, we will not keep your data for longer than is necessary. When deciding how long to hold your data we have regard to legal requirements (including any contractually agreed periods) and statutory limitation periods (under which it is prudent for us to retain records for longer periods).

**SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA/CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA**

We do not envisage that we will be processing any special category data or any information on criminal convictions.

**CONSENT**

8\. Where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you have a right to withdraw your consent at any time.  This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

  * Data you input into online forms. For example, if you are signing up to our marketing updates, you will be asked for your name and email address.
  * Time and date of visit.
  * Session identifier.



We also collect technical data via Live Yield (who in turn may use Google Analytics), however, these reports do not contain any personal data. However, we may keep limited contact details inputted into our forms (your name and email address) for authentication purposes.

For information you are asked to provide (as part of signing up to a service), you are obliged to provide this to enable us to perform the contract with you and to ensure our IT systems remain secure and effective. A failure to provide this may mean we are unable to provide you with the services you require.

When you access our website, cookies will be created.

Cookies are pieces of data created when you visit a site, and contain a unique, anonymous number. They are stored in the cookie directory of your hard drive, and do not expire at the end of your session.

We use two types of cookie- session detail cookies (which are used for session recognition during a session) which we store in browser local storage, and Device ID cookies (which expire after 30 days). Cookies do not contain any personal information about you and cannot be used to identify an individual user. If you choose not to accept the cookie, this will not affect your access to the majority of facilities available on our websites.

Although your browser may be set up to allow the creation of cookies, you can specify that you be prompted before a site puts a cookie on your hard disk, so that you can decide whether to allow or disallow the cookie. You can also opt-out of cookie storage via our domain found at pubocean.com. Alternatively, you can set your computer not to accept any cookie.

Log files are also created when persons visit our website. They allow us to record visitors’ use of the websites and include your IP address. We may put together log file information from all our visitors, which we use to make improvements to the content and layout of the websites and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around it. We also use your IP address for geographic analysis (IP2Geo mapping). This can identify your IP geographical address based on your city used to access our website. However, your individual address cannot be deduced by the IP address alone.

Your IP address is recorded automatically when you access our website to assist us in monitoring and improving content and for security reasons. You are, therefore, obligated to provide this when accessing the website. Once you have provided your IP address and we have completed our geographic analysis, we amend the last octet of your IP address so it is set to zero. As such, we do not store your full IP address.

**The purposes of processing**

  * To register you as a new client and provide services to you as requested;
  * To be able to contact you in relation to the service and effectively manage our relationship with you;

We also process data as required by law, including, to comply with legal obligations such as security obligations in data protection legislation (such as prevention of unauthorised access).

19\. Your data will be shared internally with our IT and Marketing departments. It may also be provided to our managers (and their support staff and subordinates where appropriate) to the extent necessary for their role and to make decisions about the business, however, this will usually be in an anonymised format (e.g. statistics).
