The marketing emails you receive from our “Publications” are based on the preferences you provide in your account.

All this information is made available to us by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-in configuration works. However, the only information that we retain and process is your email address. If you do not want your information to be shared within our group of “Publications” by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your account using your account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.
