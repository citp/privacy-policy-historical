# HelloLocal.com Privacy Policy

HelloLocal.com and all of our city-guide sites (i.e. HelloSeattle.com, HelloChicago.com) and its social media components (i.e. HelloSeattle.com/commons/, HelloChicago.com/commons/) will treat our visitors with the utmost care and respect. We do not collect email addresses for advertising, nor do we buy email addresses or send SPAM. 

Anytime you purchase a product or service on our sites, a high level of encryption is used to prevent fraud or theft.

Neither representatives from HelloLocal.com nor our partners will ask for credit card or financial information through emails. 

Everything on our sites will be suitable for the entire family. Sometimes we will link to places of interest in a particular city. We periodically review these sites to make sure the content is appropriate for all ages. Occasionally, links to sites may lead to unsuitable content if that website has changed its content. If you observe this, please send us an email with the city site and link so we can remove it.
