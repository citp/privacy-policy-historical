<p>We do not use any information collected from our web sites (including anonymous data collected through cookies) for purposes of online behaviorally-targeted advertising (e.g., the delivery of targeted banner ads to computers or devices) through any third-party "network advertisers" or "ad servers."

<h3>Non disclosure to third parties</h3>
<p>Unless we have your express consent via e-mail or opt-in, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties. We may also disclose or transfer your data to data processors or to business partners who are acting on our behalf, subject to a Data Processor Agreement.

<p>We endeavor to take all reasonable steps to protect your privacy. We follow generally accepted security procedures and use reasonable efforts to prevent loss, theft and unauthorized access to information which you have given us, such as firewalls, access control procedures and cryptography.

You should be aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information (including information generated through the use of cookies) when you visit their websites.
