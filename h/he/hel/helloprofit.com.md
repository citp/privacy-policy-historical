# Privacy Policy | HelloProfit

## Section A: Overview

### 1\. The reason for this policy

  1. This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) also known as ‘Personal Data’ is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is  
information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. United States privacy laws apply to all persons outside of the European Union, whether  
or not said persons are residents or citizens of the United States and its outlying territories. The European (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all EU residents and citizens effective as of May 25th, 2018.
  2. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.
  3. You have legal rights with regard to the way your personal data is handled. Depending on your citizenship and residency, you may be subject to legal rights under the scope of European or United States applicable law.
  4. You have the right to complain under Article 77 of the GDPR to the supervisory authority of Company.
  5. In the course of our business activities we collect, store and process personal data about our customers, suppliers and other third parties, and therefore in order to comply with the law and to maintain confidence in our business, we acknowledge the  
importance of correct and lawful treatment of this data.
  6. All people working in or with our business are obliged to comply with this policy when processing personal data.



### 2\. Introduction

  3. This policy sets out rules on data protection and the legal conditions that must be satisfied when we obtain, handle, process, transfer and store personal data.
  4. The procedures and principles set out herein must be followed at all times by us and our employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company.
  5. We aim to ensure the correct, lawful, and fair handling of your personal data and to respect your legal rights.



### 3\. The meaning of key Data Protection terms

  1. **Data** is information which is stored electronically, on a computer, or in certain paper-based filing systems.

or it can be an opinion about that person, their actions and behaviour.
  4. **Data controllers** are the people who or organizations which determine the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is processed. They are responsible for establishing practices and policies in line with the Act.  
We are the data controller and data processor of personal data used in our business for our own commercial purposes.
  5. **Processing** is any activity that involves use of the data. It includes obtaining, recording or holding the data, or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the data including organising, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing,

## Section B: Data Protection Principles

### 1\. Lawful, Fair, and Transparent Data Processing

applies:

  1. **(consent)** the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;

  6. **(legitimate interests)** processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Data Controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the  
data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.



### 2\. Processed for Specified, Explicit and Legitimate Purposes

data received from third parties though this is not our intention, as laid out in this Policy.
  2. The Company only processes personal data for the specific purposes set out in Schedule 1 of this Policy (or for other purposes expressly permitted by the Regulation). The purposes for which we process personal data will be informed to data subjects

### 5\. Timely Processing

The Company shall not keep personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the purposes for which that data was originally collected and processed. When the data is no longer required or there is no foreseeable use for such data in future or

  2. In the event that any affected personal data has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be informed of any rectification of that personal data.



### 5\. Erasure of Personal Data

    * The personal data has been processed unlawfully;
    * The personal data needs to be erased in order for the Company to comply with a particular legal obligation.
  2. Unless the Company has reasonable grounds to refuse to erase personal data, all requests for erasure shall be complied with, and the data subject informed of the erasure within a reasonable amount of time after the receipt of the data subject’s  
request (this can be extended by up to two months in the case of complex requests, and in such cases the data subject shall be informed of the need for the extension).
  3. In the event that any personal data that is to be erased in response to a data subject request has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be informed of the erasure (unless it is impossible or would require disproportionate effort to  
do so).



### 6\. Restriction of Personal Data Processing

  1. Data subjects may request that the Company ceases processing the personal data it holds about them. If a data subject makes such a request, the Company shall retain only the amount of personal data pertaining to that data subject that is necessary

legal right under the Regulation to receive a copy of their personal data and to use it for other purposes (namely transmitting it to other Data Controllers, e.g. other organizations).

  4. All requests for copies of personal data shall be complied with within a reasonable amount of time upon receipt of the data subject’s request (this can be extended by up to two months in the case of complex requests in the case of complex or  
numerous requests, and in such cases the data subject shall be informed of the need for the extension).

  2. Where a data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data based on its legitimate interests, the Company shall cease such processing forthwith, unless it can be demonstrated that the Company’s legitimate grounds for such processing  
override the data subject’s interests, rights and freedoms; or the processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims.
  3. Where a data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data for direct marketing purposes, the Company shall cease such processing forthwith.
  4. However, in the event that a data subject does submit such an objection and wishes to maintain his or her subscription of Company’s services, then the Company reserves the necessary right to contact said data subject regarding billing, services, changes

### 9\. California Online Privacy Protection Act

being shared, and to comply with this policy.

### 10\. COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

  1. When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA  
Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
