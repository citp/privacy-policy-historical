            HELLO MUSIC PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy is effective as of and was last updated on January 20, 2010.</p>
        <h4 class="highlight">
            1. General.</h4>
        <p>
            This privacy policy (this <strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>) is designed to inform
            you about the type of information that Hello Music (<strong>"we,"</strong> <strong>"us,"</strong>
            or <strong>"our"</strong>) may gather or collect from you in connection with your
            use of this site (this <strong>"Site"</strong>). It also explains the conditions
            under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to
            that information.</p>
        <p>
            The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed
            in Section 6 of this document.</p>
        <h4 class="highlight">
            2. Children.</h4>
        <p>
            This Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly
            collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
        <h4 class="highlight">
            3. Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information.</h4>
        <p>
            We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying
            Information from you. <strong>"Non–Personally–Identifying Information"</strong>
            is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly
            associated with a specific person or entity. <strong>"Personally–Identifying Information,"</strong>
            by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more,
            can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <h5>
                A. Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying Information.</h5>
            <div class="indent">
                <h6>
                    (i) Web Browsers.</h6>
                <p>
                    Like most site operators, we gather Non-Personally-Identifying Information from
                    you of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
                    That information includes your Internet Protocol (<strong>"IP"</strong>) address,
                    operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages you view right
                    before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.</p>
                <h6>
                    (ii) Web Cookies.</h6>
                <p>
                    A <strong>"Web Cookie"</strong> is a string of information that a site stores on
                    your computer, and your browser provides to this Site, each time you submit a query
                    to this Site. We may use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during each
                    Site session, both to help us improve your experience and to help us understand
                    how this Site is being used.</p>
                <p>
                    IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR
                    BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
                    THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF
                    WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING
                    LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
                <h6>
                    (iii) Web Beacons.</h6>
                <p>
                    A <strong>"Web Beacon"</strong> is an object that is embedded in a web page. It
                    is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have
                    viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may place Web Beacons on
                    pages of this Site and in emails we send to you.</p>
                <p>
                    You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining
                    all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
                    tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.</p>
                <h6>
                    (iv) Third Parties’ Use of Web Beacons and Web Cookies.</h6>
                <p>
                    This Site may include third-party advertising, links to other sites, and other content
                    from third party businesses. The content posted by these parties will be reasonably
                    identifiable as coming from a third party. These third-party sites, businesses,
                    and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use
                    Web Beacons and Web Cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize
                    or optimize advertising content and to track users who link from their respective
                    sites to this Site, but this third party technology does not permit them to access
                    your Personal Information.</p>
                <p>
                    We do not have access to or control over Web Beacons or Web Cookies that these third
                    parties may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party
                    websites or businesses are not covered by this Privacy Policy but are covered by
                    their respective privacy policies as is described in more detail in Section 5 below.</p>
                <p>
                    Some third party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their
                    technology. For more information about these partners and links to their privacy
                    policies, please view each third party’s site.</p>

                B. Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information.</h5>
            <p>
                We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from users of this Site
                to help us better understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns
                and trends in usage, we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences,
                both in terms of content and ease of use. We link information gathered using Non-Personally-Identifying
                Information to Personally-Identifying Information.</p>

                C. Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information.</h5>
            <p>
                From time to time, we may also release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information
                gathered from Site users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends
                in the usage of this Site.</p>

            4. Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information.</h4>
        <p>
            As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be
            directly associated with a specific person or entity. We will only collect Personally-Identifying
            Information that you knowingly submit to us. We will not disclose your Personally-Identifying
            Information to third parties unless we obtain your permission to do so at the time

                <p>
                    We reserve the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in our possession
                    to a successor entity in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other
                    sale of all or a portion of our assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy
                    or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally-Identifying
                    Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if
                    you are given notice of that new privacy policy and you affirmatively opt-in to
                    accept it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer,
                    however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.</p>

                    We may email you about products and services that we believe may be of interest
                    to you. If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from us, please
                    follow the instructions at the bottom of each email for opting out.</p>

                    You may have the opportunity to use a service to send electronic mail to another
                    user or email list. In such cases, your valid email address and real name will be
                    included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, you may not opt out of such
                    a display, but you may choose to refrain from using this service to transmit an
                    email message.</p>

            5. Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties.</h4>
        <p>
            Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect
            to Personally-Identifying Information that you provide directly to those third parties
            or that those third parties collect for themselves. We do not control the third-party
            sites that may be accessible through this Site. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not
            apply to information provided to third-party sites or gathered by the third parties
            that operate them. Before visiting a third-party site, whether by means of a link
            on this Site or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information
            to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices
            (if any) of the third party responsible for that site, and should take those steps
            necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy.</p>

            6. Privacy Policy Changes.</h4>
        <p>
            Because of changes in technology and the growth and development of our business,
            or for other business reasons, we may need to modify this Privacy Policy from time
            to time. We will alert you by email if this policy is revised (if you have given
            us your email address), and we will post a copy of the new policy with its effective
            date on this Site. It is therefore important that you register with the site and
            notify us if you change your email address. If you do not provide us with a current
            email address, you should regularly review this policy to ensure that you are informed
            of any changes.</p>
