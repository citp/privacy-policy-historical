**Privacy Policy**

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and explains data collection and use practices for HelloIntern . The "HelloIntern" includes all Web pages, newsletters, discussion forums and lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by HelloIntern and each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. By accessing HelloIntern, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

We promise that we will use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy as follows: 

**What personal information do you collect?**

Wherever HelloIntern collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy. We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. The personal information we collect may include your name, title, company or organization name, e-mail address, phone number, work or home address, information about your job function and information about HelloIntern 

We may request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a contest or to provide additional services. Participation in contests or other promotions on the HelloIntern Network is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose personal information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 

If you are purchasing something on the HelloIntern , we, and any third party provider, need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us, or third party providers, to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose except as provided in this Privacy Policy without your express permission. 

HelloIntern also offers access to some services that require registration. We may use your registration contact information to send notification to you of products and services by e-mail. We may share that information with our clients, for example: your testimonials, and they may display it on their website to promote Hellointern.

When you register on HelloIntern you are automatically enrolled for our e-mail newsletter and other automated notifications and alerts. Whether or not you want to receive these announcements is your choice. You can modify our email preferences by signing into your account and visiting Subscriptions in your Profile section 

**Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?**

HelloIntern will disclose personal information: 

  1. When required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: 
    * Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities and conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on HelloIntern ; 
    * Protect and defend the rights or property of the HelloIntern of sites and related properties, or visitors to the HelloIntern of sites and related properties; 
    * Identify persons who may be violiating the law, the HelloIntern legal notice and Web site User Agreement, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the HelloIntern or its related properties; 
    * Fulfill a user's order or request; 
  2. To process and fulfill your order or notify you of order status; 
  3. When we have your consent to share the information; 
  4. When you use co-branded services within our network of sites, you grant us permission to pass your registration information back to that service partner. Their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies. 



We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent or as permitted by this Privacy Policy.

**What else should I know about my privacy when online?**

The HelloIntern contains many hyperlinks to third party Web sites. The HelloIntern also contains advertisements of third parties. HelloIntern is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party Web sites or advertisers. HelloIntern does not share any of the individual personal information you provide HelloIntern with the third parties to which HelloIntern links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although HelloIntern may share general, aggregate data with such third parties (such as how many people use our Site). Please check with those Web sites to determine their privacy policy.

If you use HelloIntern's discussion threads, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these discussion threads. In order to avoid your e-mail address or other personal information from being gathered and used by others for inappropriate or harmful purposes, HelloIntern advises that you should be cautious about posting a real e-mail address or other personal information to newsgroups, chats, or other public forums. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return 

Certain HelloIntern media properties use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other HelloIntern media properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer information. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. 

**Business transfers**

We are always seeking to improve our network of Web sites and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may sell a company, assets or websites or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with, or be acquired by, another company. In connection with the foregoing, we may transfer some or all of your information in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes 

**Your Consent To This Agreement**

By using the HelloIntern, you consent to the collection and use of information by HelloIntern as specified above. We reserve the right to modify this Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it 

Please send any questions about HelloIntern's Privacy Policy to: [info@hellointern.com ](mailto:info@hellointern.com)

Please note that your use of the HelloIntern of Web sites is governed by our Legal Notice.
