## Our Use of Cookies and Other Identifiers

We use identifiers such as cookies, Web beacons and IP addresses to make interactions with users easy and meaningful. 

## Cookies

When you visit Ecwid.com, Ecwid’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Ecwid, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, you remain anonymous to the Company. 

We use cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. 

If you have identified yourself to Ecwid.com, we use session cookies containing encrypted information to identify you uniquely. Each time you log into the Products and Services, your browser saves a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier tied to your account. These session cookies allow Ecwid.com to identify you uniquely while you are logged into the Products and Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Use of the Products and Services requires session cookies. 

Ecwid.com uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use to identify users who have visited our website previously. When you purchase the Products and Services or provide us with personal information, our website assigns a unique identifier to you. This unique identifier derives from a persistent cookie that Ecwid.com places on your Web browser. We especially are careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we store neither account numbers nor passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate Ecwid.com, but you will be unable to use the Products and Services successfully. 

We may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with data about Ecwid’s website users to provide you with information about us and the Products and Services. 

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies. You also can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on, however, because they allow you to take advantage of some of Ecwid’s essential features. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you won’t be able to access or use your account at [my.ecwid.com](https://my.ecwid.com/) or to enter comments and questions on our community forums. You will be able to browse Ecwid.com, to use our knowledge base ([kb.ecwid.com](http://kb.ecwid.com/)), and to read community forums.

For example, we may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify Ecwid.com when you click on a link in the email that directs you to Ecwid.com. Ecwid uses Web beacons to operate and improve Ecwid.com and email communications. 

Ecwid may use information from Web beacons in combination with data about users to provide you with information about Ecwid.com and the Products and Services.
