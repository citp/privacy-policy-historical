<h4>HELIO, INC. PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
        
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your wireless experience as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.</p>
        
<p>Helio created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how Helio collects information from users ("Users") of Helio services (the "Services") and visitors ("Visitors") to our website, how we use the information we collect and the choices you have concerning the collection and use of such information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>
        
<p>Users are asked to provide certain information when they sign up for our Services such as name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer or wireless product being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Users during the registration process is used to manage each User's account (such as billing and collections).</p>
        
<p>In order to better understand its Users, Helio collects consumer data such as ZIP code, demographics and other publicly available information from third-parties. Helio uses this data to provide product and service offers. We use data in aggregate to develop products and offers to better serve its Users.</p>
        
<p>Helio collects information from Visitors and Users who use the various parts of our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services. Helio collects consumer information about its Users through surveys or preference pages. You may request that Helio not collect consumer data by opting out.</p>
        
<p>Helio may share personal information with select affiliates in order to provide Helio services to our Users. Helio does not share identifying information (such as name and address) with such affiliates for their use in delivering product and service offers to Users. Affiliates will not be allowed to use any information provided in serving our customers to be sold, rented, or given to any other company. Affiliates are not allowed to use Helio data for any other purpose other than Helio approved programs designed to better serve Users.</p>
        
<p>In instances where Helio and an affiliate jointly promote the Services, Helio may provide the affiliate certain personal information, as a result of the joint promotion. In this instance, the information may not be used by the affiliate for any other purpose. Helio may also generate aggregate profiles from information provided during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Users). We may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.</p>
        
<p>We use registration information to contact you in a variety of ways. We may send you offers through email, phone or regular mail of Helio products and services or offers on behalf of selected affiliates. If you order products directly from Helio, we will use your information to continue to provide you products that you are interested in. You may exercise your options to not receive any marketing from Helio by opting out through any marketing email sent to you or via Helio's opt-out website when it becomes available. Customers will still receive administrative emails from Helio.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Helio Affiliates and Sponsors</h4>
        
<p>Some Helio products and services are offered to Users in conjunction with a third-party vendor. To provide these products and services, the vendor may need to collect and maintain your personal information. Helio may share non-identifying and aggregate consumer information with such affiliates in order to more effectively market our co-branded products or services offered to our customers.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Online Shopping</h4>
        
<p>At some websites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. Helio has no control over third-party websites and their use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Online Advertisements</h4>
        
<p>Helio may share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Users collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with select advertisers. In some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored advertisements. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display advertisements to specific audiences. Helio does not share personal information about its Users with these advertisers.</p>
        
<p>
          We may use DoubleClick and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our websites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here
          <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org.</a>
        
</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Voluntary Surveys</h4>
        
<p>We may periodically conduct both business and individual surveys. We encourage Users to participate in these voluntary surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third-party.</p>
        
<p>We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other Users to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third-party affiliates.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Special Cases</h4>
        
<p>It is Helio's policy not to use or share the personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, Helio may disclose personal information or information regarding use of the Services if, for any reason, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, regulations or other legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect Helio, our Services, our employees or our Users.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>"Cookies" and How Helio Uses Them</h4>
        
<p>A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. Helio may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to operate and improve the products and services we provide and to manage our network and property. If you are using an EarthLink Wireless Personal Start Page, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-Helio websites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies.</p>
        
<p>Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Helio's Commitment to Children's Privacy</h4>
        
<p>Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and other applicable laws. You must be 18 to use the Services. Helio does not attempt to ask or collect information from any person under the age of 18.</p>
        
<p>Helio may have products and web pages designed especially for younger users under the direct supervision of an adult Member. While we make every effort to ensure that these Services are fun and age-appropriate for a younger audience, we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision. For further information about tips, tools, age-appropriate or kid-friendly websites and how to report online trouble, please visit www.getnetwise.org.</p>
        
<p>Helio recommends that children ask a parent for permission before sending any personal information anywhere using the Internet.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Public Forums</h4>
        
<p>Any information that you disclose in public areas of our websites or the Internet may become public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>Helio's Commitment to Data Security</h4>
        
<p>Helio has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. We will never sell your information to a third party.</p>
        
<br>
        
<h4>How to Access or Modify Your Information</h4>
        
<p>Helio offers Users the opportunity to access or modify information provided during registration. To access or modify such information, MyAccount at www.helio.com.</p>
