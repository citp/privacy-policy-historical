# Hello : Privacy Policy

|  | 

### Scope

The [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html) describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including information provided to Hello.  In addition, the following describes our practices that are specific to Hello. 

### Personal Information

  * You can enable Hello by registering for a Hello Account and providing a username, password and e-mail address.
  * You can create a “friends list” of other Hello users by adding their email addresses to your list.  Google will store the friends list on Google’s servers, allowing you to access it whenever you log into your account.  If you invite another user to be on your friends list, that user will see your e-mail address with the invitation.  If you accept an invitation to be on another user’s friends list, that user’s list will show your e-mail address and whether you are currently logged in to Hello.
  * Your photographs are stored on your computer and transferred directly to other Hello users at your direction.  Google does not have access to your photographs unless you choose to send them to Google, such as by using Hello to post pictures on [Blogger](http://www.hello.com/how_bloggerbot_works.php).
  * During login, Hello will connect with our servers to check for security updates and new releases.  Our servers automatically record information about your connection in our log files.
  * When you use Hello, Google's servers automatically record certain information about your use. Google records information such as account activity (including number of log-ins); and other log information (including firewall type). Google servers record each connection made with another user; however, filenames, file contents, and number of files shared are not stored.



### Uses

  * We use your Hello username and password to protect your account from unauthorized access.
  * We use the stored copy of your friends list to allow you to access the list from any computer that you use to log into Hello, by downloading the list over an encrypted connection to that computer.



### Information sharing and onward transfer

  * When you share pictures with other Hello users, those users may save and forward the pictures without your permission (much like e-mail).



### Information Security

  * Hello uses Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking to connect you directly to other users’ computers.  It will only connect you to users that you have approved.
  * All chat transmissions and files that you send using Hello are protected with AES encryption.
  * Hello will use an encrypted connection to deliver your friends list to the computer you are using.



### Your Choices

  * You can terminate your Hello Account at any time by contacting our user support group from the [picasa.google.com/support](http://picasa.google.com/support/) website.  We may ask you to send e-mail from the address you used to create your account, in order to confirm the termination request.
  * You can revise or delete your friends list at any time through the Hello interface.



### Important information

  * Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the [Department of Commerce’s web site](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/).
  * Further information about the Hello service is available [here](http://hello.com/support.php)
