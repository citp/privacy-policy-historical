        <p> We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address
            to a third-party, without your consent or as permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>What else should I know about my privacy when online? </b></p>
        <p> The HelloIntern contains many hyperlinks to third party Web sites. The HelloIntern also contains advertisements
            of third parties. HelloIntern is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party Web
            sites or advertisers. HelloIntern does not share any of the individual personal information you provide HelloIntern
            with the third parties to which HelloIntern links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although
            HelloIntern may share general, aggregate data with such third parties (such as how many people use our Site).
            Please check with those Web sites to determine their privacy policy.</p>
        <p> If you use HelloIntern's discussion threads, you should be aware that any personally identifiable
            information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be
            used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information
            you choose to submit in these discussion threads. In order to avoid your e-mail address or other personal
            information from being gathered and used by others for inappropriate or harmful purposes, HelloIntern advises
            that you should be cautious about posting a real e-mail address or other personal information to
            newsgroups, chats, or other public forums. </p>
        <p> Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through
            e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short,
            if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited
            messages from other parties in return </p>
        <br>
        <p> Certain HelloIntern media properties use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using
            industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you
            and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other HelloIntern media
            properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer information. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information.
            Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. </p>

            information in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes </p>
