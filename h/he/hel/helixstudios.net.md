## 2\. Cookies & Similar Technologies

###  2.1 Summary 

Most Helix web sites use "cookies," small pieces of data that can be read by a web server in the same domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to help us retrieve your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; to combat fraud; and analyze site operations. 

We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from collecting your personal information. 

You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies, including: 

\- Browser controls to block and delete cookies; and 

\- Controls from some analytics providers to opt out of data collection in web beacons. 

###  2.2 Full text 

####  2.2.1 Our Use of Cookies 

Most Helix web sites use “cookies,” which are small pieces of data sent to your browser by a web server. Upon subsequent requests, your browser will send the cookie data to the same web server, or other web servers in the same domain, when accessing the web site. Cookies contain data that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that Helix might place on your device when you visit one of our web sites: 9ha56er983130kmrtsx6jjabseniu65sjdjnnu9 

We may use cookies for: 

\- Sign-in and Authentication   
When you sign in to a site or service using your account on an Helix web site, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. This is commonly referred to as a “session cookie”. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your user name may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your user name to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. 

\- Site Analytics   
We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services. 

In addition to the cookies Helix may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your device when you visit Helix sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services. 

####  2.2.2 How to Control Cookies 

\- Browser Controls to Block Cookies.   
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies. Instructions for blocking cookies in different browsers are usually available at each browser’s privacy statement or in their help files or settings pages.   
Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Helix sites and services that depend on cookies. 

\- Browser Controls to Delete Cookies   
If you accept cookies, you can delete them later. Instructions for deleting cookies in different browsers are usually available at each browser’s privacy statement or in their help files or settings pages.   
Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and may need to be recreated. 

\- Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection   
Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Helix does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Helix provides content or is otherwise able to collect information. 

####  2.2.3 Our Use of Web Beacons 

Helix web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. 

Finally, Helix sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations. These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. These companies may collect information about your online activities across websites or online servers, however, we prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information. You may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies by opting out on their respective web sites. 

####  2.2.4 Other Similar Technologies 

In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. 

\- Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies"   
Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies" to store data on your computer. Note that the ability to clear Flash cookies may or may not be controlled by your browser setting for standard cookies as that may vary by browser. To manage or block Flash cookies, go to the appropriate settings page, currently to be found at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html. 

\- Silverlight Application Storage   
Web sites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also have the ability to store data by using Silverlight Application Storage. To learn how to manage or block such storage, visit the Silverlight Privacy Statement.
