### What information does Help Scout collect?

Depending on your use of the Help Scout Service, we collect two types of information: _personally identifiable information_ and _non-personally identifiable information_.

#### Personally Identifiable Information 

Personally identifiable information identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Examples of personally identifiable information include your name, company name, job title, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and billing and credit card information. 

#### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single of item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, including demographic information (such as age, profession, company industry, gender, current location, or zip code), IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and statistical data involving the use of the Help Scout Service. Certain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your account preferences).

### When does Help Scout use information from third parties?

Help Scout will collect End User Customer Data necessary to provide the Help Scout Service to you. "End User Customer Data" means information about your customers in the Help Scout Service, which includes but is not limited to, first name, last name, phone number and email address.

We may use End User Customer Data to look up and store additional Public Data in order to create a more complete customer profile. "Public Data" is defined as information received from a third party partner named FullContact, a Safe Harbor Certified company. Public Data may be claimed, edited or discarded from their systems by [following this link](http://www.fullcontact.com/privacy/claim) and is subject to their [Privacy Policy](http://www.fullcontact.com/privacy/).

If you would like to opt-out of our collection of End User Customer Data, you can do so by [making a request via email](https://web.archive.org/contact/). To disable this feature, you must be the Account Owner.

### Where and when is information collected?

Help Scout will collect personally identifiable information that you submit to us. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties. For example, personally identifiable information is used to obtain credit/debit card authorization and prevent fraudulent transactions. It can also be used to further complete your Help Scout Services profile with an image or other form of information that is made publicly available by other online services.

#### Registering to Use the Help Scout Service and in the Course of Using the Help Scout Service.

You will be required to establish an account in order to take advantage of certain features of the Help Scout Service. If you wish to establish an account you will be required to provide us with information (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information). In addition, we may obtain your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments.

#### Cookies and Page Tags

We may collect non-personally identifiable information passively using "cookies" and "page tags."

"[Cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie)" are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Help Scout Service and other websites. Cookies can be used to personalize your experience on the Help Scout websites (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Help Scout Service (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use the Help Scout Service), to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Help Scout Service so that we can improve our offerings, and to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content.

You do not have to accept cookies to use the Help Scout Service. Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. However, if you reject cookies, certain features or resources of the Help Scout websites may not work properly or at all and you may have a degraded experience.

"[Page tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug)," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website or email usage information, such as how many times a specific page or email has been viewed. Page tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Help Scout Service, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain page tags.

By using cookies and page tags together, we are able to improve the Help Scout Service and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.

Finally, you should be aware that this Privacy Policy does not govern the use of third-party websites or services or providers of third-party services.

#### Log Files

We collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Help Scout Service. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Help Scout Service, to monitor the use of the Help Scout Service, and to gather general demographic information. We may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes such as personalizing your experience on the Help Scout Service and evaluating the Help Scout Service in general.

### Is the information collected through the Help Scout Service secure?

We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies.

### Is Help Scout Safe Harbor compliant?

_**January 12, 2016**  
Given the determination of the European Court of Justice that the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework does not provide a valid legal basis for transfers of personal data from Europe to the U.S., Help Scout is making available to its EU users an Agreement including the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses (also referred to as "model clauses"). [Visit this page to sign the Agreement.](https://web.archive.org/company/model-clauses/)_

[Help Scout complies](https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=27340) with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Help Scout has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Help Scout's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

[We self-certify compliance with](https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx)

### What choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of personally identifiable information?

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use personally identifiable information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You must "opt in" and give us permission to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

### Can I update or correct my personally identifiable information?

You have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by [cancelling your account](http://docs.helpscout.net/article/473-cancel-account).

To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your personally identifiable information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all personally identifiable information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably practicable.
