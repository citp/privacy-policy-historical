		<p class="title2 txt-centrado margin-top-40 bold">OVERVIEW</p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">Helpfreely.org faciliates fundraising that benefits nonprofits, associations, and any other eligible organizations (“Cause”), made possible by the online purchases of products or services that supporters of these Causes complete while shopping at participating merchant partners (“Partner”). Helpfreely.org is fully owned by the H.F.F., and references made to “we” or “our” or “us” in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") or mentions of Helpfreely.org refer to both Helpfreely.org and the H.F.F.</p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain how data is collected, used, and shared with respect to our Services (the "<b>Services</b>"), the Helpfreely.org website (the “<b>Site</b>”), and our Helpfreely Application (“HelpfreelyApp™”).

		<p class="txt-20 margin-top-40 bold"><b>Free Access and Use of Our Website</b></p>
		
		<p class="margin-top-20">Helpfreely.org offers its users free and open access to the Site. However, some of the services and content made available by the H.F.F. or third parties via our Site may require that a User first register for the service or product and then pay a specific fee as outlined in the corresponding Special Conditions, which will be made readily available in any such case.</p>

		<p class="txt-20 margin-top-40 bold"><b>Personal Data Provided by Users at Registration</b></p>
		
		<p class="margin-top-20">Following the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), if you are a Registered User, we inform you that the personal data provided, whether yours or of a third party whose consent is legitimately collected, and any other personal data provided throughout the relationship will be included in a database owned by the H.F.F. in order to facilitate:</p>

			<li class="margin-top-12">Participate in surveys to raise extra funds, and, in order to participate, we may require that you provide certain demographic and/or personally identifiable information. These kinds of surveys are always optional, and your participation is always provided on a voluntary basis.

		<p class="margin-top-20">The acceptance of this clause constitutes consent to receive communications via postal mail, email, or equivalent means, such as SMS to your mobile phone.</p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">Your personally identifiable information is used for the purposes described above, as well as to manage your account and personal settings, track the funds you raise, send you communications by email, reply to your questions or requests for information, and, in general, to provide you with our Services. In the case of a purpose that we have not specifically identified herein these terms, your personally identifiable information will be used for the purpose stated when you provide it.</p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">We guarantee a responsible use and confidentiality of personal data, and you may exercise your rights of access, rectification, cancellation, and opposition by notice to the address of the H.F.F. or by sending an email to management@helpfreelyfoundation.org with the reference "Protection Data" accompanied by a copy of Your id card or passport.</p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">Personally identifiable data via our Site or Services is never collected unless you provide it, such as during registration at the Site (which is not required) or in the case that you choose to contact us and give us your personal data, such as your email address.</p>


		<p class="txt-20 margin-top-40 bold"><b>Third Parties</b></p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">This Privacy Policy concerns only the information that Helpfreely.org collects.</p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">You are no longer at our Site when you visit the page of one of the Causes or Shops or access any external website via a link from our Site, and these third party entities may employ cookies and other tracking technologies on their own sites, which may, among other purposes, identify you as a Helpfreely.org User and serve the purpose of helping these third parties identify purchases. A third-party “affiliate network” may be used to do this on the behalf of many merchants. Any personal data or other information that these third parties collect while you use their websites or that you voluntarily make available to them falls under the terms of each third party’s respective privacy policy.</p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">Within our Services, you will find links to other websites that Helpfreely.org neither owns nor controls. We will not be held responsible for any content of these websites, nor for their individual privacy practices.</p>

		<p class="txt-20 margin-top-40 bold"><b>Use of Our Site by Children</b></p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">Helpfreely.org believes it is important to protect the privacy of children.

		<p class="txt-20 margin-top-40 bold"><b>Security</b></p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">Helpfreely.org is very concerned about keeping you and your personal information secure while using our Services. We adhere to generally accepted industry standards to ensure the protection of personal information that is submitted to us, both during its transmission and after receiving it.

		<p class="txt-20 margin-top-40 bold"><b>Duration and Termination of Services</b></p>

		<p class="margin-top-20">The Services and the content of the Site will be made available for an indefinite period of time, except in the case of exceptional circumstances that make this impossible due to force majeure or technological errors. However, the H.F.F. reserves the right to terminate or suspend any Services or content available for free via the Site at any time and according to our own discretion. </p>

		<p class="txt-20 margin-top-40 bold"><b>Governing law</b></p>

		<p class="margin-top-20 margin-bottom-40">This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain, without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules or provisions.
