# Privacy - Hello Beautiful

**_Effective as of: April 1, 2008_**

This website, together with a network of related websites and content comprising the OnOne Social Community (each, a "Site," and collectively, the "Community Sites"), is owned and operated by or on behalf of Interactive One, LLC ("Interactive One"), a subsidiary of Radio One, Inc. ("Radio One"), and/or certain affiliated companies (sometimes referred to as "we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect from you and how we may use and share that information. This Privacy Policy also explains the choices you can make about the ways this information is used by us.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Use provided at each Site, which governs your use of the Community Sites. By accessing and using any of the Community Sites (including, without limitation, any social networking features or other interactive content offered on the Sites), you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use provided on the Site. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use this Site. Please note that certain features or services discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on any or all the Community Sites at any particular time.

## APPLICABILITY AND USER RESTRICTIONS

Unless specifically stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy only applies to information collected on the Community Sites and does not apply to any information collected by any other manner or by any other websites owned by or under common control with Radio One or other affiliated companies, which may be governed by separate privacy policies. This Privacy Policy also does not apply to information about you collected by our affiliated providers, or third party web sites (e.g., ad serving and tracking services) and offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from the Community Sites. The information collected or received by such affiliated providers and third parties is also subject to their own respective privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We are not responsible for compliance with other websitesÕ privacy policies or practices.

This Site is intended for users (a) that reside in the United State of America, its territories and possessions ("United States") and (b) that are thirteen (13) years of age or older. If you are not resident of the United States, you understand that your use of the Site constitutes consent to be governed by United States laws regarding the privacy and use of Personal Information (as defined below). If you are under age 13, please do not attempt to register with any Community Sites or send any Personal Information about yourself to us. We will not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under age 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register with any Community Sites. In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a user under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We further recommend that minors over age 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. 

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

### User Content

Please note that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online (e.g., in any chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages), such information could be collected and used by people that you do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user forums may display an Internet Protocol ("IP") address along with the message posterÕs name and message. We bear no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose on any social networking features of the Community Sites.

### Personal Information

As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means personally identifiable information collected when you register with any Community Sites, such as your name, physical address, telephone number, date of birth, email address or any other identifier that permits us to contact you physically or online, and (depending on the service used) your credit card information for payment processing. You can browse the Community Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, there are certain features and services (including social networking) that may not be available for your use without providing your Personal Information. If you choose to provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers. 

In addition to Personal Information collected for registration purposes, we may collect and store the following information: 

  * your responses to the offerings and advertisements presented on the Sites;
  * information about the SitesÕ services or features that you use, and how frequently you use them; 
  * transaction-related information (such as credit card or other preferred means of payment, billing or shipping information, or a history of products purchased through the Community Sites); 
  * your responses to or entries for surveys, sweepstakes, and contests and your requests for services, products, newsletters or information
  * customer service information about you as a user of a Community Site, including any suggestions you submit to us for review; 
  * community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our Sites, and correspondence sent to us;
  * information from other companies, such as demographic and traffic data; and
  * other information from your interaction with our Sites, services, content and advertising, including computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information;



### Supplemental Information

To enhance our ability to tailor this Site to your preferences, we may combine information that you provide us on registration and other online sign up forms with other information about you that we may obtain. Unless otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, we do not share that information with any other party.

### Cookies

To enhance your experience with the Community Sites, we may use "cookies." Cookies are small data files that we place in your computer's browser when you visit the Community Sites. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, to help serve advertisements, limiting multiple responses and registrations, facilitating your ability to navigate the Community Sites, and as part of a verification or screening process. Cookies automatically identify your web browser whenever you visit the Community Sites. Also, by recording how and when you use the Community Sites, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Additionally, accepting cookies may allow you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Community Sites. If you do not wish to allow for use of cookies, you can generally opt-out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Community Sites may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. 

### Web Beacons and Similar Technologies

The Community Sites and our e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "web bug" or "clear gif," and which allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain limited information about the viewer of the web page or e-mail message (such as the type of browser downloading the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to, and the time the web beacon was viewed, as well as the URL of the page the web beacon comes from). Web beacons typically are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel) and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail message, including an advertisement or HTML content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, such as and without limitation, to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate the Community Sites, and we may include web beacons or similar technologies in e-mails in order to count how many e-mails (or particular articles, links, etc.) that we sent were actually opened. Additionally, our advertising providers may use web beacons or similar technologies to personalize and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements using data gathered over time from users of the Community Sites.

### IP Address and Log Files

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Community Sites, to help identify and analyze user trends, to customize content and advertisements offered to you, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

## SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES

### Third Party Content

When you are visiting the Community Sites, certain content may be served by a third party. These third parties may also drop their own cookies and/or use web beacons, which may be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had contact with those third parties. We do not control the use of such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information.

### Online Shopping Services

This Site may offer shopping services, which may be offered by us or by a retailer that operates a service under contract with us. If our Site offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us certain Personal Information (e.g., name, email address, billing address, and credit card number). We will use the financial information that you provide only to bill you for products and services that you request. By giving our Site your credit card and related Personal Information, you are authorizing us to give that information to the merchant and credit card company to confirm and fulfill your order. We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may also use your contact information for customer service purposes. We will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.

### Other Third Parties

Our employees, agents and contractors must have a "need-to-know" business reason to obtain access to your Personal Information. We may share your Personal Information with those who help us manage or provide content or other services for the Community Sites (e.g., message board administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes. Such outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your Personal Information to provide the Community Sites with a specific service and not for any other purpose. We may also provide your Personal Information to a third party where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires sharing your Personal Information. We also may share your Personal Information with any affiliated companies and partners if we have a business reason to do so. 

### Legal Compliance

We may access or disclose your Personal Information without your consent in order to: (i) protect or defend our legal rights or property, including those of our affiliated companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of other users of the Community Sites or members of the public, including responding to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if this Site is sold to or merges with another company not owned by or affiliated with Interactive One, we may transfer your Personal Information to any acquiring party as part of that transaction.

## YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

### Access to Personal Information

You have the opportunity to correct, update or remove your Personal Information you have provided to us at any time. Upon entering any Community Site, you may sign in using your previously issued login name and password. After signing in, click on "Account Settings" and you will have the option of either modifying or deleting your user profile settings. If you have forgotten your login name or password, click the "Forgot your password?" link, and following verification, your login name and/or password will be sent to your email address. 

### Activity Associated with Your Member/Screen Name 

Your Member Name is displayed to other members throughout the Community Sites and depending on your activity (e.g., blogging) on any Sites, may also be available to the public. All of your activity on our Sites is traceable to your Member Name. Therefore, if you associate your name with your Member Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your Community Site activities. 

### Opt-Out

You may opt-out of receiving e-mail communications from us at any time by either following the instructions to unsubscribe within an email you receive from this Site or by sending an email request to be removed from our list at info@onone.com. As explained above, if you choose not to provide us with information sought on registration or sign up forms, it is possible that you will not be able to access or use certain features of our Site. 

Some of the advertisements that appear on Community Sites may also be delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies, which collect non-personal information about your visit to or use of the Community Sites, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address. Please consult such third partiesÕ applicable privacy policies to learn more about your privacy choices. 

### Your User Profile

When you register with a Community Site, you may set up your user profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, add applications, and transmit information through various webpages. We collect this information so that we can provide you the requested service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. 

Any content you post on this Site is at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other members with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that any user content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your user content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your user content.

Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on any Community Site is a violation of the SiteÕs Terms of Use and should be reported to info@onone.com.

If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about any of our Community Sites, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email message inviting him or her to visit the Site. We store this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a friend referral if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at info@onone.com to request that we remove this information from our records.

## SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Interactive One employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice to secure information collected through the Community Sites. We believe that we have adequate security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information that we collect on our Community Sites. We also use internal protections to limit access to your Personal Information to only those people who need the information to perform a specific request. However, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (e.g., as a result of unauthorized or otherwise unlawful third party access).

### Account Protection 

Your password is the key to your user profile. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Community Site password to anyone. If you do share your password or your Personal Information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken under your user profile. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your Personal Information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, we encourage you to immediately notify us to change your password. 

### If Abuse Occurs

Although we make every effort to ensure that our e-mail list is safe, the Internet is such that we cannot guarantee that our list is invulnerable to attacks. If you believe there has been a breach of our marketing or member list security, please contact us at once at info@onone.com. 

## CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through notice on this SiteÕs home page. We encourage you to refer to visit this Privacy Policy frequently to stay informed regarding our current privacy practices. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your activity on our Community Sites.

This Site is owned and operated by or on behalf of Interactive One, LLC. As the owner of this Site, Interactive One retains all ownership rights to the information collected at this Site.
