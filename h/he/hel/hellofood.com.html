  (Last modified as of  July 24, 2010)</p>
<p>HelloFood LLC (“<u>HelloFood</u>” and “<u>we</u>”, “<u>us</u>”, or “<u>our</u>”)  recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we receive  from visitors to our website and from our clients (“<u>you</u>”). &nbsp;This  Privacy Policy governs the United States HelloFood.com website (“<u>Website</u>")  and the HelloFood.com services offered to you (“<u>Services</u>”), and explains  how we collect your personal information on our Website and through Services,  how we protect such information, and the choices you have concerning the use of  such information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Except as we disclose  in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, share, license, trade, or rent your  personal information to others. </p>
<p>We may amend this  Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy  Policy here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we  might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to  anyone. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. By using  our Website or any of our Services, products, features, tools or resources that  we provide on the Website (collectively, our "<u>Online Products</u>"),  including our products or offerings for personal digital assistants or other  handheld or mobile devices (collectively, our “<u>Handheld Products</u>”), you  agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong><br>
  We collect two types  of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally  identifiable information.&nbsp; Personally  identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to  identify or contact you ("<u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>"),  and may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date  (primarily for eligibility purposes) and billing and payment information. We  may request Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register on  our Website, subscribe to Services our purchase Online Products, post comments to  the website, or in connection with other products or services we may make  available on our Website from time to time. In all of these cases, we will  collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily  submit such information to us. Unless you give us permission to do so, we will  not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable  Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You do not have to  provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website.  However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able  to visit all sections of our Website or use all of our Online Products, such as  subscribing to our Services or posting content to a public forum such as a blog,  personal page, group page, chat room, message board, bulletin board, or similar  activity. In addition, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other  Online Products dependent upon the collection of such information.</p>
<p>When you become a  registered user of our Website, subscribe to one of our current Online  Products, or in connection with other Online Products we may make available on  our Website from time to time, we also may collect information that by itself  cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information  (like age, profession or gender) and health information (like current weight  and height) ("<u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u>").  Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include user IP addresses, browser  types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of  our Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us  understand who uses our Website and to improve and market our Website in  general and our Online Products in particular.</p>
<p>We may also  supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to  assist us in evaluating and improving our Website and Online Products, to  determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Website and Online Products  to your needs, and/or to study nutritional, weight-loss, behavioral and fitness  questions in general.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE, WHEN AND HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION  ABOUT YOU</strong><br>
  We may collect  information (including information that is Personally Identifiable Information)  from you in different manners and at different places and times on our Website,  such as when you register for our Website or subscribe to one of our Online  Products. We also may collect information from you in connection with, or  through, other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time  to time. The following is a description of the areas and/or manners in which we  primarily collect information about you.</p>
<p><u>Becoming a  Registered User and Subscription</u>.<br>
  In order to access  certain Online Products on our Website, you must first complete certain steps  to become either a registered user or a subscriber. During these steps, you may  be required to provide us with information (including Personally Identifiable  Information) such as name, zip code and email address, and, if you subscribe to  one of our Online Products, payment and billing information. This information  is used to help us understand who uses our Website, to improve our Website and  our Online Products, to contact users about requested Online Products and/or  for subscription billing purposes. It is optional for you to provide  demographic information (such as profession and number of children), but  providing this information is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized  experience on our Website.</p>
<p><u>Cookies and  Action Tags</u>.<br>
  We also collect  Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using "cookies" and  "action tags."&nbsp; "<u>Cookies</u>"  are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device in order  to identify (i) your Web browser, (ii) the activities of your computer on our  Website and (iii) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other  marketing and promotional efforts. Cookies may be used to: personalize your  experience on our Website (e.g., to dynamically generate content on webpages  specifically designed for you), assist you in using our Online Products (e.g.,  to save you time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to our  Website), and allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website  for purposes of improving our online offerings. </p>
<p>We also may use  cookies to conduct marketing and promotional efforts, tailor certain  advertisements to your browser that we think may be of interest to you, or to  determine the popularity of certain content. We may link the information stored  in cookies to Personally Identifiable Information you provide us, and to  personalize your Website experience we may store Personally Identifiable  Information you provide us in an encrypted form in temporary or “session”  cookies, which are erased when you close your browser.</p>
<p>In addition to  cookies that we place on your computer, cookies may also be placed on your  computer by third parties that we use to display or serve advertisements or to  collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information in order to provide  advertising-related services. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>For example, in the course of serving  advertisements, our third-party ad servers may place or recognize a unique  "cookie" on your browser. &nbsp;Our  third party ad servers do not collect Personally Identifiable Information on  our Website, and we do not share Personally Identifiable Information with them  without your permission. </p>
<p>You do not have to  accept cookies to use our Website, however, you may not be able to use certain  products, offerings, features, or resources of our Website (including our  Online Products) if you do not accept cookies. Although most browsers are  initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when  you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer  instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar.</p>
<p>"<u>Action tags</u>,"  also known as web beacons or GIF tags, are a web technology used to help track  anonymous website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has  been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of our Website,  including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain action  tags. Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer.&nbsp; By using cookies and action tags together, we  are able to gain valuable information to improve our Website and our Online  Products and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing  campaigns. We do not disclose any of your Personally Identifiable Information  to our advertising partners through the use of cookies or action tags.</p>
<p>Finally, please note  that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or  action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their website or  service, on or from our Website. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by  such third-party websites or providers of third-party advertising.</p>
<p><u>Handheld Products</u>.<br>
  Information is also  collected when you use our Handheld Products, including the software application  needed to utilize the Handheld Products on your handheld device (the “<u>Application</u>”).  During the installation of the Application and subsequent synchronizations, we may  collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information concerning your device (such as  the specific type of operating system and hardware you have, and the amount of  free and total memory) and the Application’s files on your device. <strong></strong></p>
<p>Our Handheld  Products also collect information about your usage of the Application (such as  the dates you last synced with the Internet or the dates you last used certain  features). When you sync your device with the Website, we store some of this  information.</p>
<p><u>Public Forums</u>.<br>
  We feature public  forums where you and other users of our Website can communicate with one  another. THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT PROTECT YOU WHEN YOU USE PUBLIC FORUMS OR  PROVIDE INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION) ABOUT  YOURSELF THROUGH ANY PUBLIC AREA AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. You should be aware  that any information shared in a public forum such as a message board, blog,  personal page, posting or bulletin board is public information and may be seen  or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><u>Log Files</u>.<strong></strong><br>
  We also collect  Non-Personally Identifiable Information through our Internet log files, which  record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other  anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website. This information  may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to monitor our  Website's use, and to gather general demographic information. We may link this  information to Personally Identifiable Information for these and other purposes  such as personalizing your experience on our Website and evaluating our Online  Products in general.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN.</strong><br>
  We are committed to  protecting the privacy of children. Our Website and Online Products are not  designed for or directed to anyone under the age of 18. We do not collect  Personally Identifiable Information from any person we actually know is under  the age of 18. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</strong><br>
  In general, we use  the information collected on our Website and through our Online Products to  help us understand who uses our Website and Online Products and how they are  used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Online  Products, to improve our Website and Online Products, and for subscription  billing purposes, if applicable. With respect to our Handheld Products, for example,  we may use such information, among other things, to ensure that your handheld  device is supported and that it has enough room for the Application, and to  confirm which versions of the Application’s files are installed on your device.</p>
<p>If you become a  registered user of our Website or subscribe to one of our Online Products, we  may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your  username. If you "opt-in" (for example, if you check a box, or if the  box is pre-checked, you do not opt out by unchecking the box) we may send you  electronic newsletters, contact you about products, services, information and  news that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If  you no longer desire to receive these communications, we will provide you with  an option to change your preferences. In addition, if you identify yourself to  us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use your  information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to respond to your  questions or comments, and we may file your questions or comments for future  reference. We may also use the information collected to contact you about  important service announcements and updates regarding our Website or Online  Products or, if you are a subscriber, about your billing account status. You  will not be able to opt-out of these service announcements and updates as they  contain important information relevant to your use of our Website and/or our  Online Products and are not promotional in nature. (If you do not wish to  receive these service announcements, you may cancel your account with us and  delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our  systems by contacting us.)</p>
<p>We may also use the  information gathered on our Website and through our Online Products to perform  statistical analysis of user behavior, to analyze and evaluate issues relating  to food and nutrition, or to evaluate and improve our Online Products. We may  link some of this information to Personally Identifiable Information for  internal purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD  PARTIES.</strong><br>
  Except as set forth  in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, we will not  disclose any information we gather from you on our Website.</p>
<p>We may disclose your  information (including Personally Identifiable Information) if we believe in  good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable  statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or  regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose Personally  Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to  believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or  bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms &amp;  Conditions or our Subscription Agreement, or to protect the safety and/or  security of our users, our Website or the general public.</p>
<p>We may provide to  third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or  contacted, including where such information is combined with similar  information of other users of our Website. For example, we might inform third  parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the  demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities  that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties  to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual  advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking  services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other  similar parties.</p>
<p>We may employ  independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "<u>Outside  Contractors</u>") to provide specific services and products related to our  Website or Online Products, such as providing payment processing and fraud  screening, and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services.  These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information  collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information,  in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your  Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the  information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to  perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside  Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information  consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your  Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us  with products or services for which we contracted.</p>
<p><strong>SALE OF BUSINESS.</strong><br>
  We reserve the right  to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or  other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of HelloFood.com or  HelloFood LLC provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of  this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>LINKING TO OTHER WEBSITES.</strong><br>
  Our Website may  contain links to other websites not owned or operated by HelloFood (for  example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, you will likely be  taken off our Website). WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF  SUCH WEBSITES. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other  websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every  website. </p>
<p><strong>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.</strong><br>
  We want your  information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure  as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from  your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. To help  ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you  provide to us via the Internet at the time you elect to become a registered  user or subscribe to our Online Products, we use Secured Socket Layer (SSL)  encryption technology in transmitting such Personally Identifiable Information  over the Internet to our servers. We secure the Personally Identifiable  Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments,  protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only employees who need  access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted  access to such information. &nbsp;There is always  a risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a  result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or  warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you  do so at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CHOICES REGARDING THE COLLECTION,  DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</strong><br>
  Except as otherwise  described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally Identifiable  Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the  time we request such information from you.

The need to back-up our systems to  protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally  Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be  difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after  receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in  databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated,  corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably  practicable.</p>
