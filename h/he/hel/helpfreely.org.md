This Privacy Policy concerns only the information that Helpfreely.org collects.

Some Helpfreely.org Partners, such as advertisers and marketing agencies, affiliate networks, analytics services, and other agents, may also use different kinds of cookies, pixel tags, and related technologies via our Services.

Any information that our business Partners may collect via these kinds of tracking technologies will remain anonymous and will not be connected to your personally identifiable information. The purpose of collecting such data may include targeting advertisements, determining site usage, analysis of advertising results or other activities, as well as other purposes.
