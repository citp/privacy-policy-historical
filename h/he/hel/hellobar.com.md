The term “Hello Bar” refers either to the business or the online platform as the context requires. The term “Services” refers to the services offered by Hello Bar. The term “Member” refers to an individual or entity who or which is registered with us to use the Services. The term “you” refers to any Member (or other party whose contact information has been provided to us over the internet) who is reading this Privacy Policy, or on behalf of whom this policy is being read. The term “Website” refers to the website with the URL [https://www.hellobar.com](https://www.hellobar.com/) and any websites attending that domain. The term “Personal Information” means information about an individual who is a Member and includes any “Supplemental Personal Information,” as defined further below, that we obtain.

#### **2\. Categories of Information We Collect**

  1. Information You Provide to Us: When you register to use Hello Bar on a free or other basis, communicate with customer service, or send us an email, you provide us with information that we collect. Such information may include your IP address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, cell phone number, credit card information, and other information such as gender, occupation and other demographic information. By providing us with this information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed and stored by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
  2. Other Information We Receive and Store: When you register to use Hello Bar, we store “cookies,” which are strings of code, on your computer or other device, either locally or through your browser. We also use electronic images known as Web beacons. With those cookies, we are aware of and collect information concerning when you visit our Website, when you use Hello Bar, your browser type and version, your operating system and platform and other similar information. With Web beacons, we can determine when you view a Hello Bar or click on a link in a Hello Bar, and collect other data. You may turn off all cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions on your browser on how to block cookies that have been placed on your computer. However, if you block our cookies it will be more difficult, and maybe impossible, to use the Services.
  3. Tracking Our Emails to Our Customers: When we send emails to our own registered Hello Bar customers, we’ll sometimes track who opened the emails and who went so far as to click on any of the hyperlinks. We do this to measure the performance of our Email Campaigns, and to improve our offerings to specific customer segments.
  4. Information From Other Sources: We may obtain additional information about you by using your email address, or other information, to directly, or through one or more services, search over the internet, or elsewhere. We thereby obtain information that appears to be related to such email address or other information, such as a name, age and participation in social media websites, (such information being referred to herein as “Supplemental Member Information”).



#### **3\. Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information**

  
We will use and disclose your Personal Information only as follows:

  1. To promote use, including continued use, of our Services.

  2. To bill and collect sums owed to us. Uses for this purpose include sending you emails, invoices, receipts and notices of delinquency, to alert you if we need a different credit card number, and to otherwise try to collect money owed. We use third parties to handle secure credit card transaction processing and send billing information to such third parties, who maintain all information in confidence, to process your orders and credit card payments.

These credit card transaction processors are third parties for purposes of the data protection laws of the European Union and the United Kingdom.

#### **4\. Third-Party Use and Disclosure of your Personal Information**

  2. The Company will use your email address to send you certain regular emails pursuant to your opt-in subscriptions to our newsletter and other regular contacts. The Company keeps your email address regardless of your subscriptions for internal use. The Company does not share your email address with third-party providers regardless except where specifically disclosed in your subscriptions to any of our services, or as noted in the terms and service of any products or services that we provide apart from access to and use of the Website.
  3. The Company also collects certain data based on your access of the Website. This includes session data, meaning information such as when and for how long you access the Website. The Website will collect information about your location based on your IP address. An IP address is a non-static identifier that allows the Company to know, in general terms, where its users are located. An IP address is not the same as a physical address, and is not the same as either your shipping address or your billing address.   
  
The Company uses your IP address for internal purposes such as knowing which countries provide certain percentages of its users. The Company does not verify your IP address or connect it to your shipping or billing address for purposes of checkout. Your IP is not and cannot be used by the Company to identify you personally. The Company will also know your IP address for purposes of logging visits to the Website from your IP address and for preventing distributed denial-of-service attacks, which are disruptive attacks on websites caused by very large numbers (hundreds of thousands or more) of near-simultaneous visits to the Website. 
  4. The Company collects information such as the number of users visiting the website at any given time, the times during which visitors visit the Website, the length of time that users use the website, which pages they visit, which products they order, and what other actions they take while on the website. This information is collected by the Website and is provided in an anonymized form to the Company’s data analytics provider, which is Google Analytics (the “Data Analytics Provider”). This information is used by the Company to track the engagement, general geographic origin, and headcount of its users. This information is combined together to provide general demographic information on the Website’s users. This information is not and cannot be used to identify you specifically. The Data Analytics Provider is segregated from internal tools that identify specific customers, for example our internal system for storing subscribers’ email addresses. 
  5. The Company may from time to time engage certain independent contractors to engage with your personal information; by way of example and not limitation, a third-party marketing services to send emails or an independent data analytics analyst who may have access to anonymous or pseudonymous information that we collect from you. All such persons are bound by express duties of confidentiality to the Company. Such persons are third parties within the meaning of the applicable privacy laws of the European Union and the United Kingdom.
