###  13.6. Security 

HelperChoice takes precautions including technical, administrative, and physical measures to safeguard your information against loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

We communicate these guidelines to all employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within our company. To protect any data stored on our servers, we regularly check and monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.

We expect you to protect the security of login information so that others cannot access your account. We strongly advise you to be careful with confidential information and to never pay anyone through our website. If we suspect anyone of online abuse or scamming, we will delete their accounts per our Terms and Conditions.
