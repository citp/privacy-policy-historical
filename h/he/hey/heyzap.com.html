<p>“Cookies” Information: When you access the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer or mobile device.</p>

<p>Your User ID. Your User ID is displayed throughout the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network and is therefore available to the public. Other people can see your activity, feedback, ratings and associated comments, etc. Therefore, if you associate your actual name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network.</p>

<h3 id="2_the_way_heyzap_uses_information">2. The Way Heyzap Uses Information</h3>

<p>Heyzap uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.</p>

<p>We may use your email address or other provided contact (e.g. mobile number), without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted and to send privacy or security related notices.</p>

<p>Heyzap uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network works and looks, to create new features and functionality.</p>

<p>Heyzap may use “Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies” information to: (a) automatically update the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network; (c) provide customized third-party advertisements, content and information; (d) monitor and report on the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (e) monitor and report aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (f) provide such metrics to Users as they pertain to such User’s uploaded content; and (g) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</p>

<h3 id="3_when_heyzap_discloses_information">3. When Heyzap Discloses Information:</h3>

<p>Please be aware that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network - such as when you publish contact information to complete your profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.</p>

<p>Heyzap may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, Application types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network. Heyzap may share your information with third parties with whom Heyzap has a strategic relationship, such as advertisers. The information shared with these third parties may be used for industry analysis, tracking ad conversions or demographic profiling. Heyzap may also provide your information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods and services Heyzap believes will be of interest to you.</p>

<p>We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; for advertising attribution; and to assist Heyzap in improving the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network and creating new services features. We contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.</p>

<p>Heyzap may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.</p>

<p>Heyzap also reserves the right to disclose User information including messages, comments, bios, and more that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Use; protect Heyzap from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Heyzap, our Users, or others.</p>

<h3 id="4_your_choices_and_access_to_your_personal_information">4. Your Choices and Access to your Personal Information</h3>

<p>You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Heyzap. However, this means you will be unable to use the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network.</p>

<p>Heyzap does respect your choice to use Apple’s IFDA opt out option. In the event you are both an Apple user and have chosen to opt out of sharing your personal data, the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network will be unable to store and use your data. Please be aware that the advertisements and other content served to you by the Heyzap Application and/or the Heyzap Network will not be optimized for your usage.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.</p>

<h3 id="5_advertisers">5. Advertisers</h3>

<p>Heyzap allows other companies, called advertisers, third-party ad servers or ad networks, referred to herein as “Advertisers,” to serve advertisements within the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network and the Heyzap Network. Heyzap shares information, including your data, with its advertisers and publishers of games and/or services that connect to the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network. Heyzap may use technology to send, directly to mobile devices, the advertisements that appear within the Heyzap Network and Application and will receive automatically collected information when this happens. Heyzap may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize advertising content. Please note that if an advertiser asks Heyzap to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the Advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. Heyzap does not permit the use of behavioral advertising or advertising specifically targeted toward children under 13 years of age.</p>

<p>While we encourage our advertisers to respect your privacy and the law, we take no responsibility for the services and advertisements provided by our advertisers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party Advertisers. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers. Heyzap reserves the right to add or remove Advertisers at its discretion and Heyzap may not at all times list such updated ad network partners in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3 id="6_advertisers_and_coppa">6. Advertisers and COPPA</h3>

<p>Heyzap will not knowingly target any advertisements to children under the age of 13. Heyzap will not knowingly collect information about children under the age of 13, and if we become aware of the collection of such knowledge, will purge that information from our systems immediately.</p>

<p>By using the Heyzap Application and/or the Heyzap Network, advertisers are agreeing not to use our services to provide advertisements to children under 13 and are ensuring their own compliance to COPPA standards. The Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network is not to be used in any child-directed advertisements. The Heyzap Application and/or Network is to be used only for contextual targeting and any use of behavioral advertising will result in the advertiser’s account being terminated immediately. If an advertiser becomes aware that their advertisements have come into conflict with COPPA, the advertiser is required to report this to Heyzap immediately. We rely on our advertisers to report any conflicts to us and do not maintain an aggressive enforcement program regarding our advertisers. If, however, you feel that any advertisers are not in compliance with COPPA or other regulations, we encourage you to contact us.</p>

<h3 id="7_developers_and_coppa">7. Developers and COPPA</h3>

<p>By using the Heyzap Application and/or the Heyzap Network, developers are agreeing not to use our services to provide applications to children under 13 and are ensuring their own compliance to COPPA standards. The Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network is not to be used in any child-directed applications. If a developer becomes aware that their applications have come into conflict with COPPA, the developer is required to report this to Heyzap immediately. We rely on our developers to report any conflicts to us and do not maintain an aggressive enforcement program regarding our developers. If, however, you feel that any developers are not in compliance with COPPA or other regulations, we encourage you to contact us.</p>

<h3 id="8_our_commitment_to_data_security">8. Our Commitment to Data Security:</h3>

<p>Heyzap uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Heyzap, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Heyzap makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<p>If Heyzap learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Heyzap may post a notice on the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at privacy@Heyzap.com.</p>

<h3 id="9_our_commitment_to_childrens_privacy">9. Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:</h3>

<p>Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, Heyzap does not allow users under 13 years of age to access the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network nor does Heyzap knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. Heyzap requires that partners confirm their audience does not target, in whole or in part, users under the age of the 13. If Heyzap learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network, then Heyzap will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>

<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network member, then please contact Heyzap at privacy@Heyzap.com to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.</p>

<h3 id="10_international_visitors">10. International Visitors:</h3>

<p>For Users visiting the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network from the European Union or other non-U.S. territories, please note that any data you enter into the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network will be transferred outside the European Union or such other non-U.S. territory for use by Heyzap and its affiliates for any of the purposes described herein. In addition, because Heyzap operates globally, we may make information we gather available to worldwide business units and affiliates. By providing any data on the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network, you hereby expressly consent to such transfers of your data to the United States or other countries.</p>

<h3 id="11_in_the_event_of_merger_or_sale">11. In the Event of Merger or Sale:</h3>

<p>In the event that Heyzap is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>

<h3 id="12_third_parties">12. Third Parties</h3>
