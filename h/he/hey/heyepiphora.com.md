# Disclosure & Privacy Policy » Hey Epiphora — Where sex toys go to be judged

#### [](https://heyepiphora.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/private-by-dayne-topkin-from-unsplash.jpg)

#### Disclosure

Hey Epiphora is a personal blog written and edited solely by me, Epiphora. I am often sent products in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I _**always**_ , without exception, present my true opinion in my reviews and posts. I do not allow pre-screening of my posts, and I will not be influenced by companies into presenting anything other than my opinion.

As a self-employed blogger, I am [an affiliate for many sex toy companies](https://heyepiphora.com/buy-toys/), and I receive a percentage of commissions from purchases made through my affiliate links. I am occasionally (but not frequently) compensated monetarily for my posts. I also accept forms of [paid advertising](https://heyepiphora.com/advertising/), such as banner images, which are placed in the sidebar. My advertising relationships do not influence anything I write on this blog.

#### Privacy Policy

_I value your privacy and right to control your information. I do not share your information with third parties. Read on for more about how your data is collected and used when you visit Hey Epiphora._

Hey Epiphora is secured by a Comodo verified SSL certificate through my host, [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?1473650), which establishes a secure connection and encrypts your actions on my site. If a non-secure page is found, it is in error and I encourage you to contact me so I can fix it!

Hey Epiphora runs on the WordPress platform, which is always kept up-to-date as a security precaution. A few of my WordPress plugins, such as [Ajax Search Pro](https://documentation.ajaxsearchpro.com/gdpr-and-cookie-policy), Relevanssi (with IP logging off), and ThirstyAffiliates (with IP logging off), log basic information from website users such as search queries and clicks. As configured, they do not track personally-identifying data. My contact form plugin only sends me the information the user specifies directly in the form.

I use Google Analytics to monitor traffic data, with IP anonymization active; Remarketing, Advertising Reporting Features, and Data Sharing Settings turned off; and [data retention](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196?hl=en) set at 14 months before user-level and event-level data is automatically deleted from Analytics’ servers.

Hey Epiphora utilizes affiliate links to track sales via cookies. All gathered information is stored on individual affiliate programs’ servers, not my own. These programs do not make customers’ personally-identifying data visible to me as an affiliate. A few of the programs log IP addresses, but I do not look at, keep, or use them for any purpose.

The comments section on Hey Epiphora runs on Disqus. Currently, users with Disqus accounts can [opt-out of tracking across all devices and browsers](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/) where they are logged in.

Email addresses and names (if specified) are collected by MailChimp and Feedburner when a user chooses to sign up for [my email newsletters](https://heyepiphora.com/subscribe), using a double opt-in system to ensure consent. Users may unsubscribe at any time from the footers of these emails, or I can unsubscribe them manually by request.

As a single-person operation, I also store some information locally. On a password-protected computer on a private, password-protected wifi network, I retain spreadsheet copies of newsletter/email subscribers and giveaway entrants from MailChimp, Feedburner, and Gleam, in case I lose access to the original lists. These files, exported directly from the services mentioned, may contain IP addresses and/or geolocation data. However, these files are not used for any other purpose other than back-up and are never shared.

Whenever I mention the name of a reader, such as in my giveaway wrap-up posts, I have confirmed their consent first.

_This privacy policy is subject to change without notice._
