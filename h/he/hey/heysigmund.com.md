**PRIVACY POLICY**

**HEY SIGMUND** (“we” or “us”) know how important it is that your personal information is handled respectfully and appropriately.  This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) discloses the privacy practices for  **HEY SIGMUND**  and is intended to notify you of the following:

  2. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
  3. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
  4. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.



**What Information Is Collected?**

**Internet Traffic Data**

Internet traffic data includes but is not limited to internet service provider information, collection of IP addresses, entry and exit pages, various operating systems and other such information.  We collect no personally identifying information by way of process. The purpose of collecting this data is to help analyse user traffic so we can be the best we can be for you.

**Cookies**  
We use “cookies” on these Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you do not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time and improving efficiency while on our site. In no way does using a cookie link to any personally identifiable information on our Site. 

**Personal Information**

**Information Collection, Use, and Sharing**  
We are the sole owners of the information collected on the Sites. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell, rent or otherwise share this information with any other individual or business entity, except as reasonably necessary to provide products, materials, or services to you.

We will use your information to respond to you, and will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.

**Your Access to and Control Over Information**  
You may opt out of any future contacts from us or request that we discontinue sending of email and other communications at any time at any time by contacting us at karen@heysigmund.com.

**Security**  
We take great precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Sites, your information is protected both online and offline.

Wherever we collect sensitive information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us by secure servers. We have included common indications of such secured features when appropriate such as a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. ** **

**Third Parties**  
Please be aware that some of our business partners may use cookies or other methods of tracking and targeting use on our site (advertisers, for example).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies and this Privacy Policy does not extend to such third parties.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects Identifier Information.

**Updates**

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time but whenever we tweak, we’ll post an update on this page.
