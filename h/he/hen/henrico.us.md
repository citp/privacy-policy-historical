# Privacy Policy - Henrico County, Virginia

Henrico County respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information while using our web site and mobile application.

## Information Collected

When the Henrico County website or mobile application is visited, information like the following is collected automatically:

  * The pages visited
  * Terms searched
  * The date and time visited
  * Arrival path to henrico.us site (either through links on other sites or search terms)
  * ISP and general geographical location
  * General technical information on the device used to access the site (web browser, operating system, and if a desktop or mobile device)
  * Crash logs (on mobile application, if enabled by the user)
  * Events taken on the site like clicking a link, downloading a file, or clicking a phone number



This data is collected in aggregate form (i.e., grouped together with everyone else’s, not by individual user). We use this data to analyze trends and data on how our site is used. This includes topics such as how many people visit the site, how people got to the site, and how people are using the website and mobile application. We are able to provide a better service to our users by researching this data.

We use Google Analytics for analytics on henrico.us. We use Microsoft App Center for analytics on the mobile application. We use Microsoft Azure and Google Firebase for notifications on the mobile app. Please visit [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Microsoft Enterprise and Developer Products Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainenterprisedeveloperproductsmodule) for more information on their privacy policies.

## Disclosure of Information

Our site offers several online services, where users can submit forms to various departments in the County to interact with various services or programs that the County offers. For example, suppose the [Restaurant Complaint Form](http://henrico.us/services/restaurant-complaint-form/) is used to file a complaint about a restaurant in Henrico County. That page asks for personally identifiable information such as name, address, and phone number. The appropriate agency receives this information, and will only share with other County agencies that might need the information to resolve the issue.

Henrico County does not sell or market such information in any way, to anyone. Henrico County will disclose such information to third parties only when required to do so by law enforcement.

Please be aware that information submitted through this website may be considered a public record subject to release by the County in response to a request made under the [Virginia Freedom of Information Act](http://www.vita.virginia.gov/about/).

GIS and other location-aware apps may use, only with express permission, geographical information to improve the functionality of the application. If using a smartphone, a location warning will ask, “(This app) would like to use your current location,” providing the option to accept or decline. If declined, the current location is not available in that application.
