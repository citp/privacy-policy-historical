# Privacy Policy - County of Henrico

## What information is collected during your visit to our web site?

When you visit the Henrico County website, the information like the following is collected automatically:

  * The pages you visited
  * The date and time you visited
  * How you got to our site (either through links on other sites or search terms)
  * ISP and general geographical location
  * General technical information on the device used to access the site (web browser, operating system, and if a computer or mobile device)



We collect this data in aggregate form (i.e., grouped together with everyone else’s, not by individual user).

We use this data to analyze trends and data on how our site is used. This includes topics such as how many people visit the site, how people got to the site, and how people are using the website. We are able to provide a better service to our users by researching this data.

We use Google Analytics for this service. For more information on their privacy policies, you can read the [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

## Personally Identifiable Information

We treat such information the same way as if it had arrived in a letter. For example, suppose you use the [Restaurant Complaint Form](https://web.archive.org/health/environmental-health/complaint/) to file a complaint about a restaurant in Henrico County. That page asks you to enter personally identifiable information such as your name, address, and phone number. The appropriate agency receives this information, and can only share with other  
County agencies that might need the information to resolve the issue.

The County of Henrico does not sell or market such information in any way, to anyone. The County of Henrico will disclose such information to third parties only when required to do so by law enforcement.

GIS and other location-aware apps may use, only with your express permission, your geographical information to improve the functionality of the application. You may have seen this kind of location warning if you have a smartphone and have used on it any app that asks, “(This app) would like to use your current location,” and you accept or decline. If you decline, your location is not available in that application.

## Cookies

> “A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.” – From [Google’s Policies and Principles](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/cookies/).

Cookies are a common part of using the web today, as is privacy. Users have the choice to disable or customize the use of cookies used in their browsers. It is up to the user to enable this type of feature. By disabling cookies, certain parts of the web may not work as designed.

A few parts of our websites use cookies, including but not limited to

  * [Henrico Jobs](http://www.henricojobs.com/)

## Outside Links

Some County of Henrico web pages have links to web sites outside of the County’s web site (henrico.us). Links to other websites are included due to relevance or interest, and do not constitute endorsement by the County of Henrico.

Our website offers searching of the site, backed by Google Site Search. The software tracks search terms used on the site, but it does not correlate a search term to a user. We use this data to assist users to find information quicker on common search terms. This software adheres to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).
