We use the information you provide about yourself for Hendrix Advancement records only. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to process a donation or other such actions. If you mark an information field "public" this means that only registered users of the net community will be able to access your information. This is how the college keeps your information safe. Your information will never be on the public domain of the Hendrix website.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

You can register with our website if you would like to receive information about the College. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the appropriate registration form.

Finally, we use non-identifying and aggregate site-activity for standard reporting and analysis to improve site content, usability, and functionality.

## Security

We make every effort to protect the personal information of those in the Hendrix community, including those who visit Hendrix web sites. The College has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information.
