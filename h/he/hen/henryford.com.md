# Internet Privacy, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI

## The Choice is Yours

Using the Internet to communicate with Henry Ford through www.henryford.com is completely voluntary. You should read this statement to understand the benefits and risks of communicating over the Internet. If you do not choose to communicate with us over the Internet, you may browse our web site anonymously.

###### Signing Up for MyHealth

Communicating with Henry Ford using MyHealth provides greater Internet security because communications will then be protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128-bit encrypting software and by use of a PIN (personal identification number).

To use this service, you must sign up by submitting a registration form available at [www.henryford.com](http://www.henryford.com/).

You can submit the form electronically, by fax or mail. Once we receive a completed form and verify your information, we will mail to you by regular US Mail a PIN for you to use when accessing MyHealth. When you sign on for the first time, you'll be asked for your login ID and PIN. You must use the PIN that was mailed to you and then will be prompted to change it. The registration process, login ID and PIN help us verify who you are. This is important because some of the MyHealth features give access to confidential personal and health information. If you share your PIN with others, they will also be able to access some of this confidential information. We strongly encourage you not to share your PIN. Protect your PIN at least as carefully as you would protect your bank's ATM PIN.

###### Using Email

There are a number of risks you should consider before using email to communicate with us: email can be circulated, forwarded and stored in numerous paper and electronic files; email can be intercepted, altered, forwarded or used without authorization or detection; email senders can easily misaddress an email; backup copies of email may exist even after the sender deletes the email; employers and online services have the right to inspect email transmitted through their systems; email is easier to falsify than handwritten or signed documents; and email can be used to introduce viruses into computer systems. Confidentiality of Internet communications cannot be guaranteed by Henry Ford. Use of the Internet is solely at your own risk.

###### Information We Collect When you Visit

We use "cookies" to personalize our site for you and to collect aggregate information about site usage by all of our users. A cookie is a text file that our web site transfers to your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes. We use this information to evaluate and improve our web site. The cookie assigns a random, unique number to your computer. We do not collect any information that can be used to personally identify you unless you voluntarily register for MyHealth, subscribe to a newsletter, request information, order a product or service, or send an email to us. IF YOU USE MYHEALTH, SUBSCRIBE TO A NEWSLETTER, REQUEST INFORMATION, REQUEST A PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR SEND US AN E-MAIL, WE WILL HAVE YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS AT OUR SITE.

###### Information We Collect When You Communicate with Us Over the Internet

Henry Ford is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information you provide to us over the Internet. All information is protected by our privacy policies, which we periodically review and update. If you choose to communicate with us over the Internet, we may request personally identifiable information from you necessary for us to process your request for information, respond to your questions or deliver a product or service. Personally identifiable information is any information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, web address or medical record number. When you send information to us, the information may be shared with our employees and contractors who need to know the information to respond to your request and as permitted by law. We keep some of this information for a period of time as determined necessary by us. Information collected when you respond to surveys and promotions on our web site will be used for internal purposes, including developing web site information and services. We may inform you of new products and services from Henry Ford based on the information you provide us.

###### Security

Henry Ford takes steps to make all information received from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use. All information is protected by our security measures, which we periodically review and update. We use security technology to protect you during your Internet communications with us. This security includes server authentication, encryption and data integrity. Your personal information is protected from unauthorized access by a secure firewall and security infrastructure. During transmission of information using MyHealth, your privacy is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128-bit encrypting software. We employ physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to maintain the security of your information.

###### Links To Other Web Sites

We have links from our web site to a number of different health care related web sites. When you click on one of these links, you leave www.henryford.com and link to another web site not controlled by Henry Ford. We do not control the privacy policies or security measures of any these health care related sites. You should read the privacy statements on the other sites you visit to understand their privacy practices.

###### Here's What You Can Do To Protect Your Internet Communications

There are things you can do to improve the privacy and security of your Internet communications. Here are a few of them: Register for MyHealth, which is more secure than e-mail. Do not communicate sensitive or confidential information to us over the Internet from work. Your employer has the right to inspect your email, co-workers may see the information on a computer screen and you can inadvertently forward the email to co-workers or others. After you submit or receive information online, end your browser session before leaving your computer. This helps preserve the confidentiality of your data by ensuring that you are not leaving personally identifiable information on the computer for those who use the computer after you. This is especially important if you are using a computer in a public area. If you communicate with us over the Internet, tell us when your email address changes.

###### Changes to This Statement

We periodically review and update our privacy policies and security measures. When we do so we may need to change or update this statement and reserve the right to do so. All updates and changes automatically apply to you without notice. If you do not believe that this policy gives you the Internet privacy and security protection you need, you have the ability and right to stop interacting with Henry Ford over the Internet by exiting this web site now.
