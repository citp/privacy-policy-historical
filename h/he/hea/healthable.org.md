We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.

**TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES**

Krafty Sprouts is based in the United States and we process and store information in the United States. Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

**YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES**

Promotional Communications.

You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Krafty Sprouts by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about updates to our Services.

California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please contact us at **legal@kraftysprouts.com**. However, please note that under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it permits California residents to opt-in to, or opt-out of, this type of sharing. Krafty Sprouts qualifies for this alternative option by providing you with the ability to opt-in to such sharing at the time we collect information about you.

**RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREAS**

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data.

  * We have your consent to share your personal data.
  * We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the Krafty Sprouts Services you have requested).
  * We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may process your personal data to communicate with you about changes to our Services and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.



**Data Subject Requests**

If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us as indicated below.
