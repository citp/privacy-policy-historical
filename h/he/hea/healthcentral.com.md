1\. **Overview**

The HealthCentral Network, Inc. ("THCN"), a Delaware corporation, owns and operates the web sites [www.drdrew.com](http://www.drdrew.com/), [www.drkoop.com](http://www.drkoop.com/), [www.foodfit.com](http://www.foodfit.com/), [www.healthcentral.com](http://www.healthcentral.com/), [www.healthscout.com](http://www.healthscout.com/), [www.healthsquare.com](http://www.healthsquare.com/), and [www.mdchoice.com](http://www.mdchoice.com/) (the "Sites"). 

This Privacy Policy covers THCN's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") that THCN gathers when its users access and use the Web Sites and when they use content and/or services on the Web Sites. THCN knows that users care about how their personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. 

**By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Sites, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of THCN and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.**

2\. **Information Collected Through the Site:** We collect Personal Data through the Sites when you voluntarily chose to provide us with such Personal Data. THCN collects Personal Data from our users at several different points on the Sites. Such types of information, and the points at which they are collected, include: 

**_Personal Data:_**

A. **Registration.** Our Sites' registration system requires users to give us various Personal Data, such as their name and e-mail address, ZIP code, sex, age or income level. Such contact information is used to contact the user when necessary. Users may also choose (opt-in) to subscribe to newsletters (as further explained in the choice/opt-in section below). 

B. **Surveys and Questionnaires.** Our online surveys and questionnaires may ask users for contact and demographic information. The user's Personal Data is used to contact the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (as further explained in the choice/opt-in section below). Personal Data requested as part of a survey or questionnaire might, for instance, include name, email address, ZIP code, sex, age or income level, as well as health-related information. 

C. **Contests.** We may run contests on our Sites in which we ask users for certain Personal Data, as well as demographic information. The user's Personal Data is used to contact the user when necessary. Users may choose to receive future mailings (as further explained in the choice/opt-in section below). Personal Data requested as part of a contest might, for instance, include name, email address, ZIP code, sex, age or income level. 

**_Other Information:_**

D. **Demographics.** We receive and store certain types of information whenever users interact with our Sites. THCN automatically receives and records information on our server logs from users' browsers including IP addresses, THCN cookie information, and the page requested. 

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Sites and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. THCN only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify a user personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users access parts of the Sites so that we can make the Sites appealing to as many users as possible, and improve the content. This information may be shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregated basis, but it does not indicate the identity of individual users. 

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While THCN will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available. 

E. **IP Addresses.** An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Through the Sites, we collect IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct Site analysis. If a user requests pages from the Sites, our servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing Personal Data. However, we will use IP addresses to identify any user who refuses to comply with our in-house rules or terms of service, and to identify users who threaten our service, Sites, customers, advertisers or others. 

F. **Cookies.** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Our Sites use cookies during your online session to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies allow us to avoid showing you the same ad or other message repeatedly. Our cookies do not collect or contain Personal Data. They do enable us to relate your use of the Sites to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to our Sites. THCN does not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Data that would reveal the identity of a user, his/her user or screen name or email address. 

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Sites' most attractive features. 

3\. **Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:**

We use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, will we use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the certain services available through the Sites, we will use your Personal Data to provide access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. We and our subsidiaries and affiliates (the "THCN Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Sites to help us improve the content and functionality of the Sites, to better understand our users and to improve our services. The THCN Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see Section 10, regarding "Choice and Opt-Out," below. In addition, at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or to have your name deleted from our mailing lists please contact us as indicated below. If we intend on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected. 

4\. **Our Disclosure of your Personal Data and Other Information:**

THCN is not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you and will not disclose your Personal Data to a third party except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below: 

A. **Business Transfers:** As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. To the extent possible, we would require any acquiring company to follow the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

B. **Related Companies:** We may also share your Personal Data with the THCN Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
