Dear Friends, 

First and foremost, HealthScout is deeply committed to preserving your privacy. We have established stringent rules of privacy and responsibility in order to protect the rights of HealthScout users. 

  * All of the information you choose to provide us is absolutely confidential and voluntary. We will never give, sell, rent or reveal your name or address (including e-mail) to any outside party without your express consent. 
  * We understand that many companies make similar promises, but it may reassure you to know that HealthScout rigorously guards consumer health data. 
  * Any personal information you provide will be used only to deliver health news and advertising tailored to your personal interests, to draw large composite pictures that reflect the opinions or behavior of a group, or to help us understand whether you like and use the health information we provide. The only exception is if, in certain situations, you give us explicit permission to release it to a third party. 
  * We use DoubleClick and other third party advertising companies to deliver ads to this web site. Information about your visit to this site, such as the number of times that you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you on this site. For more information about DoubleClick, and to learn your choices about not having this information used to serve you ads, please click [here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy). 
  * Like many online systems, HealthScout utilizes a common technology called a "cookie" to gather information about how the material we publish is used. Cookies also help a Web system recognize a previous visitor and remember any preferences that may have been set during earlier visits. Cookies can securely store a user's password, personalize your news and help us understand the kinds of content you're interested in. We will not use cookies to gather identifying information about you (such as your name or address) without your express consent. In the course of delivering advertisements to this site, DoubleClick, one of our third party ad servers, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The information associated with this cookie is non-personally identifiable. 
  * To use HealthScout's self-health tests, quizzes, services and "tools" (such as a cholesterol calculator), you will be asked to volunteer personal information (ranging from height to blood pressure). We may occasionally use some of this data in statistical form to understand factors such as our percentage of male to female users, geographic locations, age groups, or the proportion of users concerned about diabetes, arthritis and other conditions. 
  * HealthScout will not share any personal identifying information with any third party without your express consent. We may disclose it in aggregate (group) form to third parties, such as advertisers or other business partners. We share no personally identifiable information of any kind or in any form with DoubleClick, one of our third party ad servers. 
  * Please note that HealthScout's core business is not running a Web site. Instead, we report and then syndicate original health news, plus health tips, services and tools to hundreds of other Web sites. While we are extremely fussy about the Web sites to whom we license our content, as well as those from whom we take advertising, monitoring every area of every site at all times is impossible. If you find our material on an Internet location you believe doesn't respect our privacy policies (or our advertising standards), please e-mail [Webmaster@healthscout.com](mailto:webmaster@healthscout.com). 
  * Please be aware that when you disclose personal information (such as your name or e-mail address) in chat rooms on bulletin boards or in any non-HealthScout area, that information may be collected by others outside our control. 



These policies are effective as of July 2, 2001. HealthScout reserves the right to change them at any time, and will post any changes as soon as they are in effect. We are prepared to enforce, expand and/or strengthen them whenever necessary. 

Thanks for reading this, and for using HealthScout.  
Sincerely, 

  
The Management Team at HealthScout.com
