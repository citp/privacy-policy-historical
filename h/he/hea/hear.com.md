**Information Collection**

We collect information in two ways: personal information and information we get from your use of our services.

**Personal Information** is information that is associated with your personal identity. We use personal information to understand your needs and interests, and to provide you with better products and services. Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured it will be used only to support your customer relationship with hear.com. We take the trust you place in us seriously. We will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to any third-party. While using our site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. “Personally identifiable information” may include, but is not limited to your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or date of birth.

**Information we get from your use of our services** is data about usage and service operation that is not associated with a specific identity. We collect and analyze non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use our website. Aggregate data we collect may include pages visited on the site, unique URLs visited within the site, browser type, and IP address. Most non-personal data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies.

**Cookies** are files with a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Like many sites, we use “cookies” to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers); however, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

**Information Use and Sharing**

We will use your information to respond to you, personalize your experience, improve our website and improve customer service.  
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via mail and email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

**Third Party Websites**

This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on www.hear.com. Other websites that may be accessible through this website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link to any such website, we urge you review the website’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.

**Child Privacy**

We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act) and we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.

**Security**

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database. This database is only accessible by those authorized to access such systems, and these individuals are required to keep the information confidential.

To request an amendment, please write us at the address mentioned on top of this statement. Your request should include the reasons why you think we should make the amendment. If we deny part or all of your request, we will provide a written notice that explains our reasons for doing so. You will have the right to have certain information related to your requested amendment included in your records.

**3\. Right to an Accounting of Disclosures**. You have a right to request an “accounting of disclosures,” which identifies certain other persons or organizations to whom we have disclosed your health information in accordance with applicable law and the protections afforded in this Notice. Many routine disclosures we make will not be included in this accounting; however, the accounting will include many non-routine disclosures. To request an accounting of disclosures, please write us at the address mentioned on top of this statement and indicate a time period within the past six years for the disclosures you want us to include. You have a right to receive one accounting within every twelve month period for free. However, we may charge you for the cost of providing any additional accounting in that same twelve month period.

**4\. Right to Request Additional Privacy Protections**. You have the right to request that we further restrict the way we use and disclose your health information to treat your condition, collect payment for that treatment, or run our business operations.

We are not required to agree to your request for a restriction, and in some cases the restriction you request may not be permitted under law.

Once we have agreed to a restriction, you have the right to revoke the restriction at any time. Under some circumstances, we will also have the right to revoke the restriction as long as we notify you before doing so.
