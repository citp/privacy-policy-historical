Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time without prior notice to reflect changes in our data practices. We will post a prominent notice on our Sites to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Policy and indicate at the bottom of the notice when it was most recently updated.

We also may obtain information about you from our parent, affiliate or subsidiary companies, business partners and other third parties and publicly available information.

The types of information we may obtain include:

  * Username and password for the account you may establish on our Sites.
  * Payment details (including payment card number, security code, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address) if you buy products on our Sites.
  * Your demographic information (such as zip or postal code, occupation, education and experience, and if you choose to provide it, age, gender and race or ethnicity). We collect this information either through the registration process, from your resume or in the manner described above. 
  * Job search behavior and preferences, and a record of the searches that you make on our Sites. We do this in order to present you with job recommendations based on your interests as expressed previously through your searches. 
  * Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties.



We collect information stored in your social media profile that you authorize us to access when you use your social media profile to enact features on the Sites, such as the ability to pre-populate our registration form or a job application, or the ability to see which of your friends have contacts with employers that interest you. CareerBuilder provides software applications (“Apps") available to the public, as well as Apps that may be purchased by companies for their employee’s internal use in talent management. Through the use of these Apps, we may collect your social network data, but will never use nor share non-public social network data that you have restricted through your social network’s privacy settings. 

  * If you decide to download one of our Apps, such as Work@, we will collect your profile information, including your social network site user ID, work email address, name, city, state, social network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names.
  * If you decide to download one of our apps, such as Work@ , we will also collect information about your friends and their connections. This includes, depending on your friend’s privacy settings, names, locations, and employment histories. 
  * Through use of the Work@ App, the individuals with whom you have a relationship on the social networking site may provide their contact information to you or directly to CareerBuilder’s customers when they request a referral or they apply for a job. CareerBuilder will collect the contact information of the individuals with whom you have a relationship on the social networking site in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the relevant terms of use associated with that social networking site. Depending on those individuals’ privacy settings, such information can include their social network site user ID, name, city, state, social network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names.
  * When you use the Work@ App on your social network page or use the Work@ App on someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of that Work@ App.
  * If social network connections use the Work@ App to apply for a job or request a referral, CareerBuilder will collect those individuals’ names and email addresses and notify you about this activity.
  * When you invite individuals from your social network to use our Apps, make an introduction between individuals in your social network and other Work@ members, or send messages through the Work@ App, we collect and maintain the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.
  * We do not collect information on social media private messages that are not hosted by our App, unless we are a party to the message, such as when a user sends an app invite request.



In addition, when you visit our Sites or use our mobile applications, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, as described in more detail below. The information we may collect by automated means includes:

  * Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser and operating system type).
  * Pages and URLs that refer visitors to our Sites, also pages and URLs that visitors exit to once they leave our Sites.
  * Dates and times of visits to our Sites.

### INFORMATION WE SHARE

When you apply for a job through the Sites or publicly post your resume to our resume database, employers will have access to information about you and your potential interest in employment opportunities. Those employers may use your information to contact you directly. Additionally, when you apply for a job through the Sites, the information supplied by you becomes part of the CareerBuilder database but also may become part of the employer’s database. Similarly, if your resume is downloaded by an employer, your resume may become a part of the employer’s database. In these instances, the use of such information by the employer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company’s use of your information. 

Additionally, we may combine certain non-personally identifiable Aggregate Data about our users and use such anonymous Aggregate Data to prepare reports for our users (typically employers or educators). “Aggregate Data” is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together. Aggregate Data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals. For example, an employer may purchase a report from CareerBuilder that states the number of accountants with at least five year’s experience that live within a certain geographic area. All such reports sold only contain Aggregate Data which cannot be used to identify any individuals. 

We also provide reports about activity on our Work@ App that may contain identifiable information about users who choose to download and use that App. CareerBuilder’s customers that purchase the Work@ App will receive reports that contain the information collected through the Work@ App. The reports may include the following: the number of installations and removals of the Work@ App, the number of referrals, shares and wall posts made by you, the number of views and the names and email addresses of individuals with whom you have a relationship when they request a referral or when they apply for a job. CareerBuilder will not provide any other social network page content to its customers who purchase the Work@ App. 

Other than instances where users opt to publicly post their Personal Information to our resume database, provide it via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason. When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display. All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information on a public resume) via the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages, for which CareerBuilder is not responsible, from third parties. 

Where you have provided Personal Information on a Site that is ‘hosted’ or ‘co-branded’ by another company then that information will be made available to both CareerBuilder and the hosting/co-branding company. CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information. You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information. 

We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.

CareerBuilder also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Sites. 

In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of CareerBuilder.

### Resume Privacy Options

Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of employers with open positions each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.

We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting their resume on the Internet. To accommodate the needs of all users, CareerBuilder has 2 levels of resume privacy from which you can choose. Please note that these privacy settings only apply to whether or not your resume can be viewed by third parties. CareerBuilder will still collect, use or disclose anonymous, aggregated information about you and your visits to our website in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.

  1. ### Standard Posting

This option gives you the most visibility to the broadest employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our resume database. If you select this option, any registered employer user who purchases access to the database can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your resume). 
  2. ### Private Posting For Apply Online Only

This option allows you to post your resume on the Sites without having it searchable by or viewable to employers. The benefit is that you can quickly and easily apply for jobs without retyping your information, and you provide your resume only to those employers you are specifically interested in.



We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the use of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly, you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume.

### About Cookies, Tracking Choices, and Third Party Advertisers

A “cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon," is also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail.

CareerBuilder uses cookies and other similar technologies for the convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. CareerBuilder also uses cookies to store non-personally identifying information about you such as past jobs viewed and job searches conducted by your computer in a cookie that it places on your computer. We do this in order to present you with job recommendations based on your interests as expressed previously through your searches. Lastly, CareerBuilder uses cookies to ensure the proper functioning and efficiency of our Sites. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please be aware, however, that some CareerBuilder features or services may not function properly without cookies.

CareerBuilder permits third party cookies on its Sites. For example, third party tools located on the Sites, including those that allow for social media sharing, may use cookies to remember user preference settings. CareerBuilder also uses web analytics services provided by third parties, which use cookies to collect non-personal information about details of our users’ visits to the Sites (including IP addresses) and the resources they access on the Sites. These third party web analytics services provide us with reports based on this information in order to help us understand how visitors engage with the Sites. 

We use third-party advertising companies who may place or access cookies on your computer hard drive to distinguish your web browser uniquely and to keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the webs pages on which the ads appeared. These companies may use information about your visits to these Sites and to other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on our Sites or on other, third party, sites. We also may give third party advertisers the ability to tailor their advertisements on our Sites using demographic and preference information we provide to them in aggregate form. This information does not identify you individually. 

These companies operate under their own privacy policies and CareerBuilder encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of such companies. CareerBuilder does not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer by third party advertisers. 

Our Site does not respond to web browser do not track signals. However, to help prevent and limit the automatic collection of information by any participating third party advertisers, including the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual’s online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services, you may opt-out of such collection by clicking the Ad Choices icon located within the ad, by accessing the [“about ads” opt-out site](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), or by accessing the [NAI opt-out site](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Please note that this opt-out is cookie-based. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. To obtain instructions regarding deleting or disabling cookies from third party advertising companies that are not members of the About Ads or NAI self-regulatory behavioral ad opt-out groups, please [click here](http://www.careerbuilder.com/Jobseeker/Page.aspx?pagever=remove-cookies). 

In addition, some of the employers that use our Sites may place cookies on your computer through their job postings and may use such cookies to distinguish your web browser uniquely. Often, employers use such information to track the effectiveness of their job postings by measuring how many users who view their postings later became job applicants. To obtain guidance regarding deleting or disabling cookies, please [click here](http://www.careerbuilder.com/Jobseeker/Page.aspx?pagever=remove-cookies). 

### Update Your Account Information

You may access, update and amend Personal Information included in your online account at any time by logging into your account and making the necessary changes. You may also delete your account, including your Personal Information and any resumes from our databases at any time by logging in to your account and making an account deletion request. Deleting your account will remove your Personal Information and resumes from our databases. However, if you have applied to a job in the past, that particular employer will still be able to access your resume. Further, you will not be able to delete data held by third parties, such as prospective employers, that already have accessed and downloaded your information or resume. In addition, we will retain anonymous Aggregate Data for uses described above. Please allow up to thirty days to process your account deletion request.

### Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Prospective Employers

  * You should use your own careful judgment about whether and what information to provide prospective employers.
  * DO NOT PUT SENSITIVE INFORMATION, SUCH AS YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, ON YOUR RESUME. 
  * CareerBuilder’s Sites are open to the public, and we cannot guarantee that all users of our services have a legitimate need to the information they seek. 
  * Do not provide your social security number, national identification number or any state, provincial or other local identification number to a prospective employer via online application. Identity thieves may attempt to trick you into providing sensitive information. Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e., your social security number or any other state or national identification number, eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.
  * Job seekers should never provide credit card or bank numbers or engage in a monetary transaction of any sort. 
  * Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country. 



For additional details regarding How To Spot Fraud Online, please [click here.](http://www.careerbuilder.com/JobSeeker/Info/privacy.aspx?version=fraud)

We use secure socket layer (or “SSL") technology to protect credit card transactions. The SSL technology encrypts credit card numbers while in transit so that they are not intercepted by unintended third parties. We use BluePay Processing LLC to process credit card purchases and their privacy policy may be viewed [here.](http://www.bluepay.com/privacy-policy)
