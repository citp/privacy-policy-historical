<b><u>The Information We Collect</u></b><br><br>

At some Time Inc. sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities.  The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include:  name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.<br><br> 


At some other Time Inc. sites, you can submit information about other people.  For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address.  The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include:  recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.<br><br>  

At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.<br><br>

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).<br><br>

<b><u>How We Use the Information</u></b><br><br>

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.<br><br>

We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards.  From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.<br><br>  

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience.  We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.<br><br>

If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us.<br><br>

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.

Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.<br><br>
