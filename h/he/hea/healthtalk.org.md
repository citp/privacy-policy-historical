DIPEx (registered charity #1087019) is committed to protecting any personal data you have shared with us. This policy sets out how we collect, use and store your data.

 **About us**  
This website is run by DIPEx, a charity registered in the UK (number 1087019). Your data is processed by or on behalf of DIPEx. 

 **Collecting and using data**  
We may collect or store personal data from you:  
• Any time you contact us via email, our contact form, social media, in order to respond to queries or to record feedback about the website or charity.  
• If you have donated to us and given us permission, we may access and download your contact details from our partners Justgiving or Stripe.  
• If you sign up for our Scrapbooks feature, so that we can understand how it is being used and so that you can log in to the feature.

If you have given permission, we may occasionally contact you for marketing purposes or to invite you to events.

 **Storing data**  
We take appropriate measures to ensure that your data is secure. We will not store your data for any longer than is reasonably necessary. Please contact us directly if your story appears on the website and you would like to find out how we handle your data.

 **Sensitive data**  
We are unable to provide any medical advice and we ask that you do not contact us disclosing any information about your health or the health of a friend or relative.

 **Disclosure to third parties**  
We will not sell your data. We may disclose your personal information to third party partners such as email marketing or event ticketing providers. As mentioned above, we cannot answer individual requests for medical advice or support. Occasionally we receive emails that give us cause for concern over an individual’s safety, in that case we may pass on your contact details to a third party who can help (e.g. The Samaritans).

 **Changes to this policy**  
Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page of the website. 

 **Cookies**  
By using healthtalk.org you consent to the use of “cookies”. If you have signed up for our scrapbooks feature, we may use cookies to recognise you when you return to our website. Cookies are also used by our website analytics, to allow us to know how well the website is performing. You may switch your browser to not accept cookies.
