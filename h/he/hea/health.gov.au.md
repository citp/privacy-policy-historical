# Department of Health | Privacy and personal information

## Privacy

The Australian Department of Health is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with the Commonwealth _Privacy Act 1988_ including the thirteen Australian Privacy Principles ( **APP** s) contained in that Act. The APPs replaced the old Information Privacy Principles ( **IPP** s) on 12 March 2014.

## APP Privacy Policy

The Department’s APP privacy policy (required by APP 1.3) can be accessed at [The Department’s APP privacy policy web page](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/privacy-policy). The APP privacy policy explains how the Department deals with personal information generally, including its collection, storage, security, access, use and disclosure.

## Australian Information Commissioner

The Australian Information Commissioner is the statutory office-holder responsible for the regulation of privacy laws in Australia in accordance with the _Privacy Act 1988_. [The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s website](http://www.oaic.gov.au/). That website contains more information about the _Privacy Act 1988_ and includes Australian privacy principles guidelines.

## Privacy Impact Assessments

The [Privacy (Australian Government Agencies – Governance) APP Code 2017 (Cth)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-registers/privacy-codes/privacy-australian-government-agencies-governance-app-code-2017) (the APP Code) requires that all agencies, including the Department of Health, must conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for all high privacy risk projects. A register of these PIAs is maintained by the Department, and the table below will be updated with PIAs completed since the Code came into effect on 1 July 2018.
