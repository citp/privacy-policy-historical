## Detailed Privacy Policy

I have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate my firm commitment to privacy. In particular, the Policy sets forth my information gathering and dissemination practices with respect to this web site. The Policy applies only to data collected on-line.

## If You Identify Yourself

I want to be very clear: I will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to me. 

You may decide to send me personally identifying information, for example, in an email. Each time you do so, I will use this information to better serve you.

When you do provide personally identifiable information I may use it to send you product announcements or tips on getting more benefit from my products, surveys regarding current services or potential new services that may be offered, as well as to send you event notices and announcements, and promotional materials regarding specific programs, products, and services. If you no longer wish to receive such messages an unsubscribe option is placed in every piece of correspondence you receive from me.

If applicable, every time you purchase a product on my web site you will receive order acknowledgment emails, and if applicable, product fulfillment emails. If the product you purchase is a teleseminar or other event, you will receive event details via email.

I take commercially appropriate measures to safeguard the personally identifiable information that you share with me. As such, I use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

## Third Party Providers

I may occasionally enlist vendors to provide services on my behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of my services. I will only provide those vendors with the personally identifiable information that they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

I may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, however, your personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number, etc.) is not transferred to the third party.

I use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

In that event, you will receive notice through my website of that change in control and practices, and I will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser honors any opt-out requests you might make of us.
