## Details about information collected and used on this site:

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data temporarily stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site (who you are, your email address, or anything personal). The cookie helps the user to save time. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Web browsers can be set to reject cookies. If a user rejects the cookie they may still use our site, but may not be able to take advantage of certain features - such as logging into your user account. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Cookies help us evaluate your use of our site, such as what kind of information you want to see and what kind you will never read. Cookie technology allows Web sites to ask for your registration and preference questions only once. The next time you return to the Web site you will not necessarily need to "sign in" again. Remember that cookies are "non-executable" pieces of code; that is, they are incapable of doing anything to your hard drive. It is possible that your 'cookies' could be read by other websites - typically used to display relevant content across the internet. Cookies are easy to delete from your hard drive; talk to your systems administrator or your Internet provider for detailed instructions.

### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user preferences, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information on our site, and not visible to any other users.

### Forums, Blogs, Comments, and other Public Discussions

Our [Online Discussion Groups](https://web.archive.org/bcb/) have a bulletin board format that allows our visitors the opportunity to interact with our online community. These areas are moderated by volunteer hosts, strictly to keep inappropriate messages from being posted. You are offered the opportunity to include your email address with your message, and your birthday in your profile - but you are not obligated to do so. If you do include these and have activated the option to show them - then it is visible to the general public on the bulletin board. We cannot control the actions of any third parties use of public information. We do not sell any email addresses from our bulletin boards. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on public message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. Think before you post, and be sure of your of your privacy settings!

You may unsubscribe at any time through our unsubscribe page. Surveys & Contests From time to time Health Discovery requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Some of the information requested is of a personal nature but there is certainly no obligation to answer every question. In particular, submission of your email address is entirely optional. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Large population demographics may be compiled and published using this data but no individual information is ever disseminated.

When a user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. We do use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.

### Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our message board will have an "opt-out" mechanism so users can keep their e-mail address off our lists. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving this communications using our un-subscribe option. Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. Protecting the privacy of our visitors is our topmost concern.
