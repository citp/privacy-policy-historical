### Privacy and Information Disclosure Terms

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data temporarily stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site (who you are, your email address, or anything personal). The cookie helps the user to save time. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Web browsers can be set to reject cookies. If a user rejects the cookie they may still use our site, but may not be able to take advantage of certain features. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

Cookies help us evaluate your use of our site, such as what kind of information you want to see and what kind you will never read. Cookie technology allows Web sites to ask for your registration and preference questions only once. The next time you return to the Web site you will not necessarily need to "sign in" again. Remember that cookies are "non-executable" pieces of code; that is, they are incapable of doing anything to your hard drive. 

Cookies are easy to delete from your hard drive; talk to your systems administrator or your Internet provider for detailed instructions. 

  
**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user preferences, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes and our agreements with such providers restrict the use of this information. 

From time to time we may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

**Third Parties**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)
