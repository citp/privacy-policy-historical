# PRIVACY | Healthy Debates

HEALTHY DEBATES (“ **HEALTHY DEBATES** “) operates HEALTHYDEBATES.COM and may operate other websites. It is HEALTHY DEBATES’S policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, HEALTHY DEBATES collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. HEALTHY DEBATES’S purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how HEALTHY DEBATES’S visitors use its website. From time to time, HEALTHY DEBATES may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

HEALTHY DEBATES also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on HEALTHYDEBATES.COM blogs/sites. HEALTHY DEBATES only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to HEALTHY DEBATES’S websites choose to interact with HEALTHY DEBATES in ways that require HEALTHY DEBATES to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that HEALTHY DEBATES gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at [HEALTHYDEBATES.COM](http://www.healthydebates.com/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with HEALTHY DEBATES are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, HEALTHY DEBATES collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with HEALTHY DEBATES. HEALTHY DEBATES does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

HEALTHY DEBATES discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on HEALTHY DEBATES’S behalf or to provide services available at HEALTHY DEBATES’S websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using HEALTHY DEBATES’S websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. HEALTHY DEBATES will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, HEALTHY DEBATES discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when HEALTHY DEBATES believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of HEALTHY DEBATES, third parties or the public at large.
