# Privacy and Security Policy - Life Insurance .Net

Lifeinsurance.net is a Better Business Bureau certified web site dedicated to enabling individuals and families to achieve financial security and peace of mind. LifeInsurance.net is also committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement explains Lifeinsurance.net’s policies and practices regarding information collected on this web site and how we use that information. Lifeinsurance.net is a division of IdentityWEB, Inc. As used in this Privacy Statement, “Lifeinsurance.net,” “we” and “our” refer to IdentityWEB. 

**I. Browse With Confidence**

The LifeInsurance.net Web site contains a wealth of information designed to help you purchase the life insurance that is right for you. You are welcome to browse the site without revealing any personally identifiable information. 

If you decide to tell us about yourself, whether by completing one of our Quote Request Forms or otherwise, you need not worry about your privacy because we do not willfully use, sell or disclose your personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do so or unless we are required to do so by law. 

**II. General Information We Collect and How We Use It**. 

Like most other web sites, LifeInsurance.net automatically collects certain limited information, but that information but does not identify you. LifeInsurance.net collects and stores your computer’s Internet address (IP protocol) but not your email address. LifeInsurance.net also collects and stores the date and time you accessed the LifeInsurance.net site and tracks the pages or documents accessed within the site. This information is collected for systems administration and for analyzing and improving the value of the material available on the LifeInsurance.net web site. If this information is ever given to third parties, it is given only in an aggregated form and cannot identify you or anyone else. 

The LifeInsurance.net Web site relies upon "cookies" to tailor the information delivered to the user. Cookies are small web-generated files that are stored on your computer hard drive in order to collect information about your activities on a particular web site. LifeInsurance.net uses cookies to monitor security, navigation and usage of its Web site. If you decide to give us personally identifiable information, we may also use cookies to personalize your experience at our web site. You can set your browser to prevent web sites from placing cookies on your computer. 

**How can I turn off cookies?**  
That depends on the browser you're using:

  2. Click the Security tab, then the Internet icon.  

  3. Click the Custom Level box.  

  4. Under Cookies, click either Disable or Prompt. (Prompt requires you to click yes or no every time a Web site wants you to accept a cookie.)



 **Netscape**

**III. How We Use the Information You Submit in Our Online Forms.**

A. Quote Request Forms. 

If you click on “Get a Free Quote,” we will collect your name, address, telephone numbers, e-mail address and other information pertinent to your purchase of life insurance. We collect this information by asking you to enter it into our Quote Request Form. You may give us the information or not — the choice is yours. 

When you submit personally identifiable information via our quote request form, your personal information is stored on our secure server. We also email it to a licensed insurance professional for purposes of giving you a personalized life insurance quotation, but we do not share it with anyone else unless you give us permission to do so or we are required to do so by law. 

B. Other Uses of Information. 

When you submit a Quote Request Form, we will automatically send you Your Financial Health, our monthly email Newsletter, and perhaps also other information which we believe will be valuable to you. (See below regarding how to end these communications.) 

We may also use information received from our users in an aggregated form for purposes evaluating the quality of our service or communicating the effectiveness of our business. But such aggregated information will not identify you or anyone else. 

**IV. Security of Information**

The security of confidential and private information is one of our top priorities. Information we receive via the Annuity.net web site is stored on our secure servers and is protected by a firewall. 

LifeInsurance.net provides links to third-party web sites as a convenience to our users. The inclusion of any link does not imply an endorsement or recommendation of the third-party organization, its web site, or its products and services. LifeInsurance.net has not reviewed and is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such web sites. LifeInsurance.net is also not responsible for the security of email messages sent over the Internet.

**VI. Children.** The LifeInsurance.net Web site is designed to help adults purchase life insurance and related financial services. LifeInsurance.net does not knowingly collect information from children and does not market its services to Children. This site is not meant for children under the age of 18, and we do not provide privacy measures designed to protect children when using the Internet unsupervised. 

**VII. Other Agreements Which May Differ From This Privacy Statement.**

This Privacy Statement is not intended to supercede or modify the terms of any agreement between LifeInsurance.net and any third party. If the terms of this Privacy Statement are inconsistent with the terms of any such Agreement, the terms of the other agreement shall control. 

**VIII. Changes In Our Privacy Statement.**

LifeInsurance.net reserves the right to change its privacy policies and practices. The most current Privacy Statement will be posted on this web site. If at any time in the future LifeInsurance.net decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from the manner described in our Privacy Statement at the time the information was collected, LifeInsurance.net will notify users by way of an e-mail and will give users a method to opt-out of having their personally identifiable information used in the different manner.
