# privacy policy | HealthyWomen

**Introduction**

The National Women's Health Resource Center, Inc. ("HealthyWomen") doing business as HealthyWomen believe strongly in an individual's right to privacy. We recognize that you trust us to provide quality health information. We apply these same high standards when we protect your Personal Information ("Personal Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify the person to whom such information pertains) and Personal Health Information ("Personal Health Information" is defined as any information that combines your Personal Information with known health characteristics).

When you visit HealthyWomen's website, [www.healthywomen.org](http://www.healthywomen.org/ "www.healthywomen.org") (the "Website"), we may request and/or collect a minimal amount of Personal Information and Personal Health Information. This information is requested and/or collected in order to better serve you through the various applications on the Website.

The information included on the Website is provided free-of-charge, and we encourage visitors to gain access to as much health information as possible.

To help users understand the Personal Information and Personal Health Information we gather and the practices we employ, HealthyWomen has developed this Privacy Policy.

**Disclosure of Information**

Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, HealthyWomen will not disclose any Personal Information or Personal Health Information it gathers from you on the Website. We may only release Personal Information or Personal Health Information to third-parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personal Information or Personal Health Information to a third-party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. In addition, we may disclose Personal Information as described below. 

**How is Personal Information Requested and/or Collected and Used at HealthyWomen?**

**1\. User (Consumer) Surveys** \- Our user surveys include registering Personal Information, such as name, email address, address, age, last education level attained, profession, ethnicity, primary language, household income, relationship status. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the visitor therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose Personal Information.

The information gathered from user surveys is used for internal analysis purposes, so that we learn about the profile of our user audience. HealthyWomen does not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease, or otherwise provide to third parties any individually attributable information. HealthyWomen however, reserves the right to review and disclose aggregate data and information with third-parties to better serve our users, but will only do so in a fashion that protects from disclosure every user's Personal Information.

**2\. Aggregate Data** – HealthyWomen may combine, in a non-identifiable format, the Personal Information and Personal Health Information you provide with information from other users to create a compilation of statistical data ("Aggregate Data") that may be disclosed to third-parties. Aggregate Data does not contain any information that could be used to contact or identify you. For example, HealthyWomen may use information gathered to create a composite profile of all the users of a particular third-party site. These third-party websites may use this information to understand community needs and to design appropriate programs and activities on their site. HealthyWomen will not disclose your Personal Information and Personal Health Information to any third-party without your prior permission, except as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy.

**3\. Women's Health Surveys** \- Topic-specific surveys at the site may or may not request a participant to register/provide Personal Information and/or Personal Health Information.

HealthyWomen does not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease, or otherwise provide to third-parties any Personal Information and/or Personal Health Information. HealthyWomen, however, reserves the right to review and disclose aggregate survey data with third-parties to better serve our users, but will only do so in a fashion that protects from disclosure every user's Personal Information and Personal Health Information.

These forums are to be respected and to be used professionally. HealthyWomen will take steps to remove individuals and/or their posts from the forums that do not abide by the Community Site's discussions protocol, such as those who include abusive language or demonstrate pornographic behavior.

This randomly generated number or cookie remains on the server machine, not on your computer, until you leave the site. When you visit the Website again, a different, unique randomly generated number or cookie is assigned.

HealthyWomen uses cookies for user convenience. This enables the user to use the site without needing to input the same Personal Information over and over again. Cookies also enable HealthyWomen on an aggregate basis to track site navigation, such as what sections users are visiting, and how long they stay there. 

HealthyWomen does not and will not use cookies to direct advertisers to you based on your Personal Information. Additionally, HealthyWomen does not and will not allow third-parties to include cookies in their banners/promotional logos.

Most browser software can be set to reject all Cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our Cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of the Website may not work properly but you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use the Website.

HealthyWomen cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries and with third-parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. Therefore, those third-parties, local, state and federal law enforcement officials can obtain your Personal Information and/or Personal Health Information as a result of a legal requirement. By way of example, HealthyWomen may be required to disclose information to the government or others under certain circumstances (e.g., matters of national security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance), or third-parties may unlawfully intercept Personal Information and/or Personal Health Information. Furthermore, we may release Personal Information and/or Personal health Information in order to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order.
