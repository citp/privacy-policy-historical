Please read this page carefully. The following HealthcareSource HR, Inc. (collectively referred to as “HealthcareSource” or “we,” “us,” “our” or other similar pronouns) privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) sets forth our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain information relating to Your use of any web site under HealthcareSource’s control, whether partial or otherwise (including, without limitation, www.healthcaresource.com, http://payst.healthcaresource.com, jobs.healthcaresource.com, the web site from which this Privacy Policy was accessed, and websites available at URLs assigned to specific customers in connection with their use of HealthcareSource’s Position Manager, Performance Manager, NetLearning, HealthcareSource Recruitment Marketing, Assessment, Job Board, Lean Human Capital Services, or other products, services, or resources offered by us) (the “Site” or “Sites”) and Your use and receipt of any and all products, services and resources offered, enabled or provided to You via the Sites, including without limitation certain software-as-a-service online programs, online training courses, online communities, live webinars, communication tools designed to facilitate personal networking, job boards, resume databases, and products and services enabling employers to complete the recruitment and hiring process (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is part of, the [HealthcareSource Terms of Service and Use](http://www.healthcaresource.com/terms-of-use.html) (“Terms and Conditions”), which governs Your use of the Sites and Services in general. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms and Conditions.

By accessing or using the Sites or the Services (including requesting, receiving, and viewing content of the Sites or Services, such as via a web browser or other program) in any way, you or the entity you represent (“You”) consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and the use of Your Data (including Personal Information), as outlined herein and as applied to Your use of the Sites and Services. If You do not consent to the use of Your Data (including Personal Information) per the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions, You may not access or use the Site or Services. If You do not grant or at any time revoke Your consent for use of any or all information described herein that is about or related to You (except as set forth under Your “opt out” rights below), Your access to the Site or Services will be terminated and Your Account and Profile will be removed from the Site and Services.

HealthcareSource takes very seriously the private nature of Your information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We recommend You consult this Privacy Policy often (at least prior to or during each access or use of the Sites or use of the Services), as the terms of this Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time without notice to You, including as we update and expand our offerings or products, services, or resources. BY ACCESSING OR VISITING THE SITES OR THE SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE OF YOUR DATA (INCLUDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION) PER THE TERMS OF THE PRIVACY POLICY IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF EACH ACCESS OR USE. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to service providers or other personnel HealthcareSource may use from time to time. Such relationships are governed by separate agreements entered into between us and such providers. Those separate agreements will, where we determine it to be practical, protect Your Data (including Personal Information) in a manner consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the role HealthcareSource plays in collecting and storing information via the Sites or Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to: (i) third party websites that may be accessible through the Sites or Services; or (ii) the privacy practices of HealthcareSource’s customers, such as employers seeking, training, or evaluating employees or job seekers, who may collect Your information through the use of certain HealthcareSource Services. Please be aware that we have no control over such websites or customers. We encourage You to inquire into the privacy practices of those third parties to learn how they may collect and use information about You.

YOU MAY OPT IN OR OPT OUT OF OUR SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES FOR THEIR MARKETING PURPOSES BY FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS IN THE “OPT IN AND OPT OUT RIGHTS” SECTION BELOW.

Except in instances in which You have been “opted in” by Your employer, by default, You have been “opted out” of these uses of Your Personal Information.

### Referrals

We may collect from You Personal Information about others. For instance, if You choose to use our Services to share content found on the Sites or other information about our products, services, or resources with Your business associates, clients, friends or family members, we may ask You for such other person’s (or entity’s) name and e-mail address, or other contact information. Such Personal Information of others will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

### IP Address and Clickstream Data

Our server may collect information about the computer or other device You use to access or use the Sites or the Services. This information may include the Internet address of the computer Yor other device You use when you access or use the Sites or the Services. Your computer’s Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer by Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) whenever You connect Your computer to the Internet. When You operate Your computer to request and receive webpages or other content from our Sites or Services, our servers may log Your IP Address. We may also log Your domain name, which is a textual identifier for Your computer that also may have been assigned by Your ISP. We use Your IP Address and domain name to help identify You and to gather demographic information about our customers as a whole. We may also record the referring webpage that linked You to us (e.g., of another website or a search engine); the webpages or other content You view on the Sites; the website or webpage You visit after the Sites; the ads You see on the Sites and/or click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings You are using when accessing and/or using the Sites or the Services; any search terms You have entered on the Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Sites and the Services. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may link this information with Your Personal Information.

Any or all of this information relating to accessing or usage of the Sites or the Services may be collected, compiled, maintained, processed, or otherwise used on our behalf by one or more service providers, including, for example, analytics vendor(s) and e-mail management partner(s).

### Imported Information

You may choose to access the Sites or Services through a third-party website such as LinkedIn or similar sites or services. When You choose to do so, HealthcareSource will import some information from Your account on such other site or service and make the imported information part of Your Account and/or Profile.

## Usage of Information

### General Usage

We may use “cookies” and “web bugs” (described in more detail below) in the Sites, Services, or in our communications with You to enhance the functionality and features of the Sites and Services in general, to verify Your viewing and/or receipt of communications, to keep (and sometimes track) information about You, and to make Your transactions and other activities more convenient and efficient. We use cookies, for example, to remember user preferences or minimize the need for You to re-enter information.

### Cookies

A “cookie” is a small data file that a website may send to Your browser and that Your browser may then store on Your computer or other device. Cookies may be used to track where You travel on the Sites and Services and what You look at and transact with. We may use cookies to deliver specific messages to You, for example, to announce a new feature that was added since the last time You visited a Site or used a Service. We may use session cookies, for example, to simulate a continuous connection, as cookies help us “remember” information about Your preferences and passwords and allow You to move within the Site without reintroducing Yourself. A cookie may enable us to relate Your use of the Site to other information about You, including Your Personal Information.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept cookies, by adjusting the preferences in Your web browser. Please know, if You refuse or delete cookies (or configure Your web browser to refuse or delete cookies), there may be some features of the Sites or Services that will not be available to You and some webpages, areas of the Sites, Services, or features may not display or function properly.

### Web Bugs

We may use web bugs (aka “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies in the Sites, Services, and/or in communications with You to enable us to evaluate Site and Services usage information about users, upgrade user information, and know whether You have visited a webpage or received a message. A “web bug” is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a webpage or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a webpage or e-mail message. A web bug may enable us to relate Your viewing or receipt of a webpage or other message to other information about You, including Your Personal Information.

### Use of Data and Personal Information

We will use the Data we collect or that You provide to use for various purposes, including, for example, to respond to Your requests, to foster a positive user experience, to provide You with the Services and features offered on or through the Sites and Services, and to operate and improve our Sites and Services.

By visiting the Site(s) or using the Service(s), including by creating an Account or Profile, by publicly posting information, or by opting in when presented with certain choices, You have consented for HealthcareSource to use Your Data, including Personal Information, in the following ways:

  * to maintain our internal record keeping;
  * to report information about Your account in connection with our collection process regarding late payments, missed payments or other defaults;
  * to enhance Your user experience;
  * to create an Account or Profile for You based on the Data You provided to us or based on the Data You imported from other sites or services;
  * to allow You to export Your Data to other Sites or Services;
  * to allow You to export Your Data to sites or services of third parties;
  * to match Data collected from You through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Site or Service usage information, and use such Data along with data obtained from other sources, including third parties;
  * to compare Your contact information to data in our databases in order to improve the Sites or Services and for marketing purposes;
  * to allow You to contact other users, including employers, job seekers, colleagues, or friends;
  * to allow employers, job seekers, colleagues, or friends to find You and connect with You;
  * to provide employers with information about You as a job seeker;
  * to make suggestions to You and draw inferences about You;
  * to customize advertisements and other content displayed to You on the Site or through the Services, including sending You new job postings or related Services, based on Your Data;
  * to analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, the Sites and Services both on an individual basis and in the aggregate;
  * to correspond with You, about products, services, companies, job opportunities, training curriculum, and events, sponsored by us and/or others, that we think might interest You; provided that You may opt-out of receiving such correspondence from us by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out Rights section above;
  * to provide our customers with benchmarks about the characteristics and trends of the talent management market, including availability, behavior, experience, and performance of talent;
  * to give search engines access to publicly posted information; and
  * to detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal.



As mentioned, we may provide You an opportunity to receive offers from other entities that have services, products, and offers that we think might be of interest to You. We do not and cannot control information collected by these entities; the collection and use of that information is subject to any applicable privacy policies of those entities. Further, we will not transfer Your contact information to any unaffiliated third party for the third party’s marketing purposes unless You expressly authorize us to do so. If You change Your mind and no longer want to receive third party promotions, follow the instructions to opt out in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above. 

Please remember that if You post or transmit any of Your Data, including Personal Information, such information may be collected and used by third-parties, including HealthcareSource’s customers, over whom we have no control. Data You post in public areas of the Site or Services or make available to certain third parties or make visible or available in certain databases, such as resume or Profile databases, may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world, including in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of Personal Information as defined in the country in which You reside. We are not responsible for the use made by such third parties of information You post or otherwise make publicly available.

We may release certain Data (including Personal Information) when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary or proper to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. We also may disclose Data (including Personal Information) in connection with investigations by us or by a government agency or when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Sites or Services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

From time to time, we may be required to provide Personal Information or other Data in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law.

HealthcareSource regards its databases (including Your Data and Personal Information) as a valuable asset. In the event that HealthcareSource is or substantially all of its assets are, acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, such databases containing Personal Information and other Data may be one of the transferred assets. In using the Site and the Services You consent to such transfer of Your Data, including Your Personal Information.

### Publicly Provided Information

You acknowledge and agree that You have no expectation of privacy with respect to Your postings on any public areas of the Sites or Services, including, without limitation, related blogs, message boards, job posting, or social media sites.

## Access and Security Information

### Access Rights

We retain all Data we gather about You in an effort to make Your repeated use with us more efficient and relevant. 

You may review, edit, and delete the Personal Information and certain other Data that is stored in Your Account or Profile on the Site or Services (e.g., Your passwords, resumes, and other contact information) by visiting a “My Profile” or similar area of Your Account or by e-mailing [solutions@healthcaresource.com](mailto:solutions@healthcaresource.com). Upon written request, we will send You a copy of the Personal Information we have on file in Your user account (if any). You may send us new or updated Personal Information at any time. We will respond to Your request to access, update or delete Your information as soon as practicable. Before we are able to provide You with any Personal Information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information, we may ask You to verify Your identity or to provide other details to help us to respond to Your request.

Please be aware that HealthcareSource is a data processor of certain information, which may include Your Data or Personal Information, for our customers. If HealthcareSource received Your Data in this way, You may be advised to contact the customer (i.e., Your potential or existing employer) with any request to access, review, correct, or delete Your Data, Personal Information, Account or Profile. Access to, or correction, update, or deletion of Your Data may be denied or limited by HealthcareSource if it would violate another person’s rights and/or as otherwise prohibited by applicable law.

### Security

HealthcareSource will take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of Your Personal Information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, including making sensitive information available to our employees and agents on a need-to-know basis. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be free or absolutely safe from unauthorized access or intrusion by others, such as hackers. By using the Sites or Services, You acknowledge that You understand and agree to assume these risks.

If You contact us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on the Sites or Services, You should be aware that Your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information You send by these methods in transit.

If You become a customer or otherwise purchase our Services, You may be able to create an account on the Sites or in the Services with a username and password. HealthcareSource policies preclude access to passwords by anyone at HealthcareSource or its service providers except on a need-to-know basis. If You do create a username and password, You are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of Your account password, and You shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Sites or Services by You or any person or entity using Your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of You, and whether or not such person or entity is Your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify HealthcareSource of any unauthorized use of Your password or account or any other breach of security, (b) take any reasonable steps within Your control to prevent any further unauthorized use or breach, (c) ensure that You exit from Your account at the end of each session, and (d) ensure that any individual leaving Your organization no longer maintains any access to Your account. It is Your sole responsibility to protect Your password, control access to and use of Your account.

We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from Your failure to comply with this provision. We will have no liability for disclosure of Your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of Your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify You of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and will do so using the contact information You have provided to us and that we have stored for You as Your Personal Information. It is Your responsibility to ensure Your contact information remains up-to-date. To the extent that the contact information we have for You includes an e-mail address, we may notify You by e-mail of any potential compromise of Your Personal Information. By visiting the Sites and using the Services, You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. 

### Phishing

Please know that it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which such an e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the website requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company, while in reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity is known as “phishing.”

Please know that we will never ask You to provide us with Your password for any reason, and will not ask You to provide any sensitive information (including Personal Information) via e-mail. If You receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that You provide any sensitive information (including Your password) via e-mail or to a Website that does not seem to be affiliated with HealthcareSource, or that otherwise seems suspicious to You, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at [solutions@healthcaresource.com](mailto:solutions@healthcaresource.com).

### Consent to Worldwide Transfer and Processing of Personal Data

When You give Your Personal Information to HealthcareSource, it may be processed by HealthcareSource in the United States and all other countries in which HealthcareSource operates or in which our affiliates operate. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection for Your personally identifiable information. Regardless of the laws in place in these countries, HealthcareSource will treat the privacy of Your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with the laws of the United States and of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. By providing Your personally identifiable information to HealthcareSource, You fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer or transmission of Your information to, and processing of Your information in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Third Party “Linked-To” Websites

When You visit the Sites or use the Services, You may have the opportunity to visit, submit Data to, or link to, other sites or services not operated by HealthcareSource, including other websites operated by unaffiliated third parties. These sites and Services may collect Personal Information and other Data about You. HealthcareSource does not control sites that are operated by these entities and we have no responsibility or liability for any tracking, data collection, security. or other information gathering practices of these sites and third parties. This Privacy Policy does not address the information practices of those other Websites.

### Do Not Track

HealthcareSource tracks its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore we encourage You to use Do Not Track (DNT) settings in your in your browser program if You wish to avoid such collection of data. Some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
