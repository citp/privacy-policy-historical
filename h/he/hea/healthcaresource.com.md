We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications regarding updates at the site, such as new job opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. 

**Disclosure of Information to Others**

We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, demographic information or information about your use of Healthcaresource.com (such as the areas you visit), except as set forth in the following four subparagraphs. 

We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party. 

We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Healthcaresource (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. 

We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Healthcaresource becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Healthcaresource or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. 

Healthcaresource may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to the sites with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors to the site and how those visitors use the site. 

Healthcaresorce supplies technology, hosting and related services to other leading companies to power recruitment areas on their Web sites. Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you on these sites becomes part of our database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than you, Healthcaresource and the company concerned without your consent. 

  


If you apply for a position through a co-branded site, you may be asked to provide information on your age, gender or race.  Some employers are required by law to gather this information from job applicants for reporting and record keeping requirements.  You should understand that if provided, this information will be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law and will not be used in making any employment decisions.  All information provided will be kept separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity.   Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information. 

**Resumes**

We give you the option of putting your resume in our database. There are two ways of doing this: 

  1. You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product. 
  2. If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. 



We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, staffing firms, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances. 

**Use of Cookies**

WE use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and save time. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing. 

You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the site. 

**Use of Web Beacons**

Healthcaresource.com pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web site usage 

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.

**Security**

We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
