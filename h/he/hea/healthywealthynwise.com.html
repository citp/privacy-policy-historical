                  depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which
                  you elect to participate and the services provided. For
                  example, you may be asked to provide information when you
                  register for access to certain portions of our site or request
                  certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a
                  purchase. You may provide information when you participate in
                  sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and
                  other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,
                  HealthyWealthynWise.com also collects information
                  automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may
                  be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the

                  technology to recognize you and hold information from your
                  visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name
                  and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that
                  information each time you visit, or may control the number of
                  times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting
                  our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also
                  gather information through other means. In certain cases, you
                  can choose not to provide us with information, for example by
                  setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you
                  do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or
                  may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we
