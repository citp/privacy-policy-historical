# Privacy « Fubra

## Good Privacy Practice = TRUST

Fubra run a network of websites, and this privacy policy applies across them all. At Fubra we recognise the importance of your privacy, so this policy outlines the data we collect, how we use it and how we safeguard your information.

Fubra may be required to revise this privacy policy in the future to comply with any applicable European regulations, in order to utilise new technologies or to improve your user experience, so please check back periodically.

## Our Privacy Principles

Fubra is responsible for the personal data of millions of web users, and as such we take privacy very seriously. This page outlines the principles behind our privacy policy, and explains how and why we use your information.

T.R.U.S.T is an ancronym for Transparency, Regulations, User control, Secure and Temporary. These are the five principles we adhere to so that you can be sure we are really looking after your data. We hope through good practice we can gain, and more importantly keep your trust in our services.

### Transparency

We believe transparency is where all good data retention policies start. Every piece of data we store is stored for a reason – mostly to improve our services. By being transparent about what we store we hope you will understand that we only need to store information to make our services better.

### Regulations

As a company we are registered by law with the Data Protection Commissioner in the UK under number Z5193400. We also closely monitor other voluntary programs that help improve the delivery of our privacy policies such as P3P.

### User Control

Much of the data collected by online companies is gathered without your knowledge. Fubra does create user profiles so that we can advertise to our users and deliver them relevant content but you are free at any time to cancel your account with us which will remove any data we hold about you from our systems, putting you fully in control.

### Secure

Our policy is to make sure we only store data when you ask us to. This is important because it allows you to make the most of the services you like, and opt out of the ones you don’t. We hope you find all our services useful, but if they aren’t we want you to be able to contact us or control the information you receive.

### Temporary

If we have data that is no longer needed we delete it. We only keep data as long as necessary and by doing this we reduce the risks associated with holding personal information.

### Fubra Passport

  * We operate a central login system called the Fubra Passport. This system is a database of the users who can access our web sites and also contains a set of preferences for each subscriber. The Fubra Passport allows you to access any of our sites with a single set of login details.
  * The data we hold in the Fubra Passport system is not available for sale to any third parties and will only ever be used by us with your consent.
  * If you would prefer not to receive alert emails or other data that we email to our subscribers free of charge then you can change or remove alerts on the Alerts pages of the relevant site.
  * If you remove all your alerts then we will no longer send you any automatic update emails. However, you will still remain a subscriber to our web sites via the Fubra Passport system and will therefore still have access to our web sites when you choose to search for information.
  * As a subscriber of the Fubra Passport we will occasionally still email you with news and information about our company, our new web site features and new web sites we develop. If you do not wish to receive any email from us at all, you must then cancel your subscription to our Fubra Passport login system. Please note once you have done this you will no longer be able to log in to any of our web sites without re-subscribing. You can use the Fubra Passport page to easily join or leave any of our other web sites that are currently supported by the system. By leaving just one site you will continue to receive emails about other sites if you remain a member of those.

## Glossary

### Cookies

Cookies are simply a way for us to record small pieces of information on your computer when you visit one of our sites, so that we can recognize your browser in future visits. This is typically used to record things like your login details, so that when you return to our sites you don’t need to type in them every time. The cookie itself is a small file that is stored by your web browser, and tied to a specific website. Each website can create its own cookie, but it can not read information from any other sites, or anywhere else on your computer.
