# Privacy Policy - Fubra

## Good Privacy Practice = TRUST

Fubra run a network of websites, and this privacy policy applies across them all. At Fubra we recognise the importance of your privacy, so this policy outlines the data we collect, how we use it and how we safeguard your information. Fubra may revise this privacy policy in the future to comply with any applicable European regulations, in order to utilise new technologies, to adapt to changing business strategy or to improve your user experience, so please check back periodically.

## Our Privacy Principles

Fubra is responsible for the personal data of millions of web users, and as such we take privacy very seriously. This page outlines the principles behind our privacy policy, and explains how and why we use your information. T.R.U.S.T is an acronym for Transparency, Regulations, User control, Secure and Temporary. These are the five principles we adhere to so that you can be sure we are really looking after your data. We hope through good practice we can gain, and more importantly keep, your trust in our services. 

### Transparency

We believe transparency is where all good data retention policies start. Every piece of data we store is stored for a reason – mostly to improve our services. By being transparent about what we store, we hope you will understand that we only need to store information to make our services better. 

### Regulations

As a company we are registered by law with the Data Protection Commissioner in the UK under number Z5193400. 

### User Control

Much of the data collected by online companies is gathered without your knowledge. Fubra does create user profiles so that we can advertise to our users and deliver them relevant content but you are free at any time to cancel your account with us which will remove any data we hold about you from our systems, putting you fully in control. 

### Secure

Our policy is to make sure we only store data when you ask us to. This is important because it allows you to make the most of the services you like, and opt out of the ones you don’t. We hope you find all our services useful but if they aren’t, we want you to be able to contact us or control the information you receive. 

### Temporary

If we have data that is no longer needed, we delete it. We only keep data as long as necessary and by doing this, we reduce the risks associated with holding personal information.

  * The data we hold in the Fubra Passport system is not available for sale to any third parties and will only ever be used by us with your consent.
  * If you would prefer not to receive alert emails or other data that we email to our subscribers free of charge, then you can change or remove alerts on the Alerts pages of the relevant site.
  * If you remove all your alerts, then we will no longer send you any automatic update emails. However, you will still remain a subscriber to our websites via the Fubra Passport system and will therefore still have access to ourweb sites when you choose to search for information.
  * As a subscriber of the Fubra Passport we will occasionally still email you with news and information about our company, our new website features and new websites we develop. If you do not wish to receive any email from us at all, you must then cancel your subscription to our Fubra Passport login system. Please note that once you have done this, you will no longer be able to log in to any of our websites without re-subscribing. You can use the Fubra Passport page to easily join or leave any of our other websites that are currently supported by the system. By leaving just one site, you will continue to receive emails about other sites if you remain a member of those.



### Links and Affiliated Sites

  * All Fubra websites contain hypertext links to external websites, both affiliated and non-affiliated ones. By clicking on one of these links, you will leave the Fubra website that you are using. Fubra has no control over the information collected by any third party after you have left one of our sites. Fubra encourages you to read the privacy policy of external sites.
  * The data collection and usage practices of any third party linked to Fubra are not covered by this privacy policy. Fubra assumes no liability, and is not responsible for any practices of such third party websites, including their privacy practices and content.



### Security

We have invested heavily in equipment and highly qualified staff to ensure all information you enter is protected from access by any third party and only necessary and restricted access is available internally. We also protect all our connections to the internet using various security measures, including firewalls and regular security audits on all our servers.
  * As required by law, we are registered on the public register of data controllers and store and process all data in accordance with all UK legislation. We are registered with the following number: Z5193400.



### App Policy

  * Fubra create and run mobile software applications for handheld devices known as “apps” for various websites and will be developing further apps in the future. Currently the apps are available through the following platforms: iTunes (for Apple devices) and Google Play (for Android devices).
  * Some of our apps will require you to log in using your Fubra Passport details. In theis case our Passport privacy policy still applies.
  * When you download an app through Google Play or Apple iTunes, these companies may pass your name, email and postcode on to us when you make a transaction. If this is the case, then we will never pass these details to third parties or use them for marketing purposes. Any information we collect is kept extremely secure using the procedures outlined in the Security section above. We may use your details to contact you occasionally with important information relating to your account. We do not collect any of your payment details as this is handled by Google Play and Apple iTunes.
  * We may use GPS technology to improve your experience of the app and so determine where in the world you are located. We will never pass this geolocation information to third parties. Should you not wish for us to know your location, you can turn off the location settings on your device.
  * The majority of Fubra apps are subject to a fee which should be stated on the download page. Prices may change over time and there may be promotional periods where app prices vary. Promotional periods are subject to a length of time and may be subject to change. Some of our apps are sold on an annual subscription basis. For these apps your subscription will expire a year after your original purchase and you will have to pay the repeated fee. On the app download page it should mention if the subscription is annual or a one-off fee.
