# Privacy Policy

  


The following is a description of how we handle information we learn about you from your visit to our Web site. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

For example: 

  * If you visit our site to read or download information, such as software or articles, we collect and store the following information: The name of the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time that you access the site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked to our site. The information is used to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site. This helps us learn which areas are most and least popular and helps us to make our site more useful to our visitors.
  * If you identify yourself by sending e-mail, we use the information you provide to collect consumer comments, answer your questions, or address any concerns. The information you provide sometimes leads to modifications of our Web site.
  * If you complete any form on the site such as a survey, sweepstakes entry, quiz, etc. to receive something free, we collect and store the information you provide. This information can include your name, street address and e-mail address. We also analyze the questions you answer. We do this to understand what products you find most useful, how often you use our products, what competitive products you use, what areas of our site you enjoy, or changes you would like to see. The information helps us provide more useful content and products. We do not share, lease, or give away this information to third parties.



Occasionally, we will work with third parties to create marketing efforts. These partners have agreed to adhere to the same privacy standards to ensure ConAgra's level of protection as stated in this private policy. When we conduct sweepstakes, surveys, and other similar marketing efforts, your e-mail address, name and/or address may be collected as your entry. We will not re-market to you without your expressed permission.

We will not send unsolicited e-mail, nor share, lease or sell names and addresses to third parties.

We do not collect any personal identifying information about you when you visit our site unless you share such information to us. Again, we never share, lease, or give away that information to third parties. We may update this policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally.
