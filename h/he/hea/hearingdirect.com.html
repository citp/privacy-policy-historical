<h3>3. WHAT  IS A COOKIE?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a tiny element of data that is stored on your  computer's hard drive by your web browser when you access a website. The Site  makes use of the following types of cookie technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>A "Session cookie", which  contains a random ID number automatically allocated to your computer by the  webserver for the duration of your visit. It is meant to make your use of the  Site faster and easier. It will be deactivated after thirty minutes of  inactivity on the Site and will be automatically removed from your computer  when you close your browser.</li>
<li>A "Script generated cookie"  is automatically allocated to your computer when you register to access any  restricted areas of the Site and on each subsequent visit. It only contains an  identifier which will enable the Site to identify you as a registered user so  that you do not have to identify yourself again while you move from one server  to another during your visit. It will remain on your computer after your visit  until you remove it. It will be placed again at your next visit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third-Party Cookies</strong></p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies or affiliates  to display advertisements on our website. These third-party advertising  companies or affiliates may separately place or recognise a cookie file on your  browser in the course of delivering advertisements to the Site. We cannot see  the information collected or stored in third party cookies. We do not provide  personal data about you to these third party advertisers or affiliates or to  any other third party.</p>
<p>You do not have to agree to the use of cookies. For  information on how to reject cookies, see below Removing and Disabling Cookies  Section. However, in order to use the payment section of the Site, we recommend  that you do not block the recording of cookies on your computer.</p>
<h3>4.  REMOVING AND DISABLING COOKIES</h3>

This may mean, however, that you  will not be able to enjoy full use of all parts of the Site.</p>
<p>If you want to remove previously-stored cookies, you can  manually delete the cookies at any time. This will not prevent websites from  placing further cookies on your computer.<br> To find out exactly how to disable/remove, please go to <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/default.aspx">http://www.aboutcookies.org/default.aspx</a>.</p>
