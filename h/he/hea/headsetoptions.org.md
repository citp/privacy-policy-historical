### Regarding Security

We have multiple procedures in place to insure that our servers and any data you provide us are 100% secure always. Chief among these is we hire third party, leading internet security firms to audit our privacy protection performance and to improve upon it. One of these vendors is VeriSign. If you provide us your personal information, you can be sure that is secure because any sensitive financial information will be collected on a Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Verisign SSL Certificates provide protection over your private data and e-commerce transactions you engage in while on our site. We also guarantee that all personal information is protected against unauthorized access.
