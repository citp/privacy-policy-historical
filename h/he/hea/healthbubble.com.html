		<p>OUTOUT: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</p>

		<p>healthbubble.com is funded by advertisers. It is the policy of healthbubble.com to accept and place these advertisements via banners and text links throughout the Web site. healthbubble.com maintains a constructive and unbiased position and does not allow advertisers to have any editorial influence. Advertisements on healthbubble.com are clearly indicated with an "advertisement" message.
		The "Start this Diet Now" button can also be a source of advertising dollars for healthbubble.com. This button is included for the reader's convenience, to quickly access the diet program or weight loss product that interests them. Often times this link directs users to the same or similar product's site and healthbubble.com receives revenue based on actions taken there. healthbubble.com accepts advertisements from direct relationships, third-party advertisers, and from advertising networks, which serve ads to the site. Advertisements displayed on healthbubble.com may be provided through an ad server or ad network. These ads are not endorsed by healthbubble.com, but do provide funding to the site.</p>

		<p>It is the policy of healthbubble.com not to share your personally identifiable information with these advertisers without prior consent. Once you've engaged with one of these advertisers, you'll need to consult their individual privacy policies to learn about their practices.</p>

		<h3>Cobranded and Other Affiliated Sites</h3>

		<p>Certain information or services offered or provided on or through the Site from time to time may be provided on or through other sites operated by or in conjunction with third party providers (“Partners”). These sites may have the same “look and feel” of the Site, and are often cobranded, such that a Partner’s logo or name may appear on the site, or the Partner’s name may appear in the URL. Aggregate or personally identifiable information collected about you on these sites may be shared by healthbubble.com with that Partner. A Partner will not rent, sell, or disclose any of your personally identifiable information to third parties unless you consent to its doing so, for example, by opting-in while on a particular site to receive information or offers from a Partner’s affiliates, partners, or other third parties.</p>

		<h3>Third Party Links and Member Websites</h3>

		<p>You acknowledge that we do not monitor, control or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties, any cobranded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in conjunction with healthbubble.com, or any credit card order processors, product shippers or other third parties who provide services throughout the Site. Accordingly, healthbubble.com assumes no liability or responsibility for the information collection and privacy practices of any third party.

Even though certain information collected by such third parties might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such third parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies.</p>

		<p>In addition, the Site may provide links to other Internet websites or resources ("Linked Sites"). healthbubble.com neither controls nor endorses such Linked Sites nor have we reviewed or approved any content that appears on such Linked Sites. You acknowledge and agree that healthbubble.com is not responsible for the legality, accuracy or inappropriate nature of any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such Linked Sites.

When physical reviews cannot be completed, extensive research is conducted to capture a thorough representation of the product, its benefits and disadvantages. The reviews published on the Site are the unbiased, objective opinion of healthbubble.com. Our reviews are never influenced by third parties or advertisers, and we do not publish sponsored reviews. We aim to present the facts about a product or service and allow the user to form their own opinion.</p>
