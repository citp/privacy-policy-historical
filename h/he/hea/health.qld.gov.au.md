# Queensland Health Privacy and Confidentiality Statement

Queensland Health is committed to protecting user privacy. We understand and appreciate that visitors and users of this web site are concerned about their privacy and the confidentiality and security of any information that may be provided to us. 

To protect your privacy Queensland Health staff follow 9 privacy principles.  The principles deal with how we collect and handle your personal information.  They are set out in the _[ Information Privacy Act 2009](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/I/InfoPrivA09.pdf)._

Although every effort will be made, Queensland Health does not guarantee to reply to e-mail correspondence. Where appropriate, e-mails sent to this site may be forwarded internally to other Queensland Health officers for direct response. 

### How do I go about obtaining access to information held about me by Queensland Health?

Requests for access to your health records must be in writing and should be directed to the office of the medical superintendent of the public hospital you have attended, or the manager of the community health service you have attended. Documentary evidence of identity should also be supplied with your request (for example, a certified copy of a driver’s licence or birth certificate).

A list of [ decision-makers](http://www.health.qld.gov.au/foi/docs/rti_ip_contacts.pdf) with their contact details is available on our website.
