We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our website and your use of the websites of selected corporate partners and advertisers through the use of Cookies. Every computer is assigned a different Cookie by HealthyHearing.com. The information collected by Cookies (i) helps us dynamically generate advertising and content on web pages or in newsletters, (ii) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website and selected corporate partners' and advertisers' sites, (iii) how many people open our emails, and (iv) for what purposes these actions are being taken. We may use Cookie information to target certain advertisements to your browser or to determine the popularity of certain content or advertisements.

If you reject our Cookies, certain functions and conveniences of our website may not work properly but you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use our site. We do not link Non-Personal Information from Cookies to Personally Identifiable Information without your permission.

### Identifiable Information We Collect About You

We use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific services you select, send you emails about website maintenance and updates, and inform you of significant changes to this Privacy Policy.

#### Newsletters & Emails to You

At registration and at various times as you use HealthyHearing.com, you will be given the option of receiving recurring informational/promotional newsletters via email from HealthyHearing.com and/or directly from third parties. At the time you sign up for our email newsletters or any time thereafter, you can choose to Opt-out of receiving additional promotional emails from HealthyHearing.com.

In order to subscribe to such newsletters via email, we need your contact information, such as name and email address. You can unsubscribe from the newsletters by simply clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email newsletter. An email to our automated unsubscribe service will be created on your computer. Click the "send" button. You will then be unsubscribed from that newsletter within two to three business days.

If you are experiencing difficulties with our automated unsubscribe service, you can email HealthyHearing.com Customer Service at webmaster@healthyhearing.com. HealthyHearing.com Customer Service will unsubscribe you from that newsletter in two to three business days.

In some cases, when you click on a link or an advertisement in an e-mail or newsletter, your browser may be momentarily directed to the website of a third party which, acting on behalf of HealthyHearing.com (see Disclosure to Website Service and Content Contractors, below), notes or "counts" your response to the e-mail or newsletter before re-directing your browser to its proper destination; this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.

When you use HealthyHearing.com's "Email a Friend" function, HealthyHearing.com emails the article or other content you designate to your friend's email address and lists your email address as the sender. HealthyHearing.com uses the friend's email address only for the purpose of sending your friend the email you requested. While we store both email addresses, we do not use them for any other purpose unless disclosed to you at the time you send the email.

#### Emails You Send to HealthyHearing.com

This Privacy Policy does not protect you when you send content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions to HealthyHearing.com by email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to HealthyHearing.com. We try to answer every email within 48 business hours, but are not always able to do so.

#### Chat Rooms and other Public Forums

As a service to our users, HealthyHearing.com features chat and eSeminar rooms and other public forums where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for experts to answer. We also offer online discussions moderated by medical or healthcare experts.

Any information shared (including Personally Identifiable) that you reveal in a chat room, message board, "Ask The Expert" posting or "User Story/Testimonial" or online discussion is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information in any public forum. What you have written may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.

#### Market Research

From time to time the HealthyHearing.com market research department, or its operations contractors acting on its behalf, conducts online research surveys in order to gather feedback about our site, our corporate partners and opinions on important healthcare issues, through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus groups.

When participating in a survey, we may ask you to submit Personally Identifiable Information. This Personally Identifiable Information is used for research purposes, and is not used for sales solicitations. When a survey is sponsored by a third party, Aggregate Information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor. Personally Identifiable Information collected through market research will only be used by HealthyHearing.com and its operations contractors and will not be given or sold to a third party without your consent.

In addition to collecting survey responses from our members, Cookies may be used to authenticate respondents or to help you pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have Cookies disabled you may not be able to participate in some studies. Cookies may be used to connect survey data with HealthyHearing.com site usage characteristics. You will be notified when we would like to use Cookies in this way and your consent will be requested for these Cookies.

#### Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on HealthyHearing.com's Behalf

Corporate Partners or advertisers on HealthyHearing.com may use their own Cookies in the banner advertisements served on HealthyHearing.com and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than HealthyHearing.com to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies on our website. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the website of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the corporate partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its proper destination (e.g., back to HealthyHearing.com to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.

We do not control these third parties' use of Cookies, or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through them. However, we do require corporate partners, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect Cookie information through our website to agree that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from our website without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any Non-Personal Information collected by them through Cookies in advertising banners on our website to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect. Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of Cookies. In order to do so, you must Opt-out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can Opt-out of Cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway Opt-out site.
