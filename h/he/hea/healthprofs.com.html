<span class="headingLarge">Privacy Statement </span>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Contents</span>
<br>This privacy statement covers the Web site psychologytoday.com. 
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our users. 
As such, this note explains: </p>

<p class="text">1. What personally identifiable information Psychology Today 
collects.<br>
2. How Psychology Today collects the information.<br>
3. How Psychology Today uses the information.<br>
4. With whom Psychology Today may share user information.<br>
5. What choices are available to users regarding collection, 
use and distribution of the information. <br>
6. What types of security procedures are in place to protect 
the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Psychology 
Today’s control. <br>
7. How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>

<p class="text">If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, 
they should contact us at Psychology Today by telephone, mail 
or email at the contact details listed on the web page marked 
<b>About/Contact</b>.</p>


<p class="headingLarge">Information Collection and Use</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Information Collection</span><br>
Psychology Today is the sole owner of the information collected on www.psychologytoday.com. Psychology Today collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Public Registration</span>
<br>In order to use some functions found on this Web site, a user 
must first complete the registration form. During registration 
a user is asked to give personal information such as name, 
address, and email address. We use this information to contact 
the user about services on our site for which he/she has expressed 
interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic 
information, and unique identifiers, but encouraged so we 
can provide a more personalized experience on our site. Users 
may also be asked to give their credit card number and expiration 
date if they wish to subscribe to our magazine or online services. 
Credit card information is SSL encrypted for user protection. 
Other options are available for users whose browsers do not 
support SSL.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Professional Registration</span>
<br>Those Professionals who wish their services to be displayed 
on this Web site must complete the registration form. During 
professional registration, a user is asked to give out personal 
information, such as name, address, and email address, as 
well as such professional information as their qualifications, 
certifications, the demographic region in which they practice, 
and what fields they specialize in. Background checks will 
be performed on registrants to assure our users of the validity 
of license information.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Information Use</span>
<br>Psychology Today does not sell or otherwise provide the information 
given to them to third party sources. All information is confidential 
unless</p>

<p class="text">a. The user wishes to create a public profile. The information 
contained within a public profile may be viewed by third parties.</p>

<p class="text">b. The information is subpoenaed by officials of the United 
States government, or if Psychology Today deems that retaining 
said information may cause a direct physical threat to one 
or more individuals.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold"> Profile</span>
<br>Psychology Today stores information collected through cookies 
and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile 
is general information that we keep on users that details 
their viewing preferences, and allows us to improve our site. 
We do not share your profile with other third parties.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold"> Cookies</span>
<br>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer 
tied to information about the user. Psychology Today uses 
both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. When a user 
closes their browser, a session ID cookie simply terminates. 
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s 
hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies 
can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>

<p class="text">By setting a cookie on our site, users have their usernames 
and passwords automatically remembered. If users reject the 
cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to 
this is that they will have to log in for each consecutive 
visit. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the 
interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold"> Log Files</span>
<br>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This 
includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet 
service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, 
date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer 
the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and 
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP 
addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable 
information contained in user profiles.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold"> Customer Service</span>
<br>Users who sign up for particular services, such as the “Ask 
our Therapist” or “Interactive” modules 
may receive email directly relating to this service. This 
will be stated in the sign-in portion of that module of the 
Website. The user will only receive email that pertains to 
the status of their account or to retrieve a forgotten password.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold"> Service Announcements</span>
<br>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out announcements 
which are strictly service-based. We send our users notices 
upon activation of their account, and also upon any password-look-up 
requests made by the user. Also, if our service is temporarily 
suspended for maintenance, or if our company were to undergo 
a large-scale transition thereby changing the nature of this 
privacy statement, we might send users an email. Generally, 
users may not opt-out of these communications, though they 
can deactivate their account. However, these communications 
are not promotional in nature.</p>

<p class="headingLarge">Sharing</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Legal Disclaimer</span>
<br>Though Psychology Today makes every effort to preserve user 
privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when 
required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such 
action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, 
a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Third Party Intermediaries</span>
<br>We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit 
card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally 
identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Business Transitions</span>
<br>In the event Psychology Today goes through a business transition, 
such as being acquired by another company, or selling a portion 
of its assets, users’ personal information will, in 
most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will 
be notified via email 30 days prior to a change of ownership 
or control of their personal information. If as a result of 
the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable 
information will be used in a manner different from that stated 
at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent 
with our notification of changes section.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Opt Out/Change User Information</span>
<br>Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ 
of creating a profile with us, or may change their profile 
at any time in the user section of this Web page. </p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Links</span>
<br>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware 
that we, Psychology Today, are not responsible for the privacy 
practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be 
aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements 
of each and every Web site that collects personal information. 
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
and dispersed by this Web site.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Security</span>
<br>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ 
information. When users submit sensitive information via the 
Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.<br>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive 
information (such as credit card number and/or social security 
number), that information is encrypted and is protected with 
SSL, the best encryption software in the industry. While on 
a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the 
bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to its un-locked 
status when users are just ‘surfing’. While we 
use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, 
we also do everything in our power to protect user-information 
off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the 
sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our 
company’s server. Only employees who need the information 
to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk 
or a customer service representative) are granted access to 
user’s personal information. Our employees must use 
password-protected logins to access this server. Each time 
they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access 
to user information. All employees are kept up-to-date on 
our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies 
are added, our employees are notified about what they can 
do to ensure our users’ information is protected. Finally, 
the servers that store personally identifiable information 
are in a secure environment in a locked building.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Supplementation of Information</span> 
<br>In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation 
to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information 
we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold"> Background Check</span>
<br>Professionals wishing to list their services on Psychology 
Today undergo a thorough background check to assure the validity 
of their claimed credentials. These background checks are 
performed by telephone by employees of Psychology Today.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">ID Verification</span>
<br>In many cases, for instance when a user enters a credit card 
number, or when a professional registers a business, it is 
necessary to perform an ID verification.</p>

<p class="text">We use EDS to verify a user’s information to assure 
the security and legality of this site.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Notification of Changes</span>
<br>If we decide to amend our privacy policy, we will post changes 
to this privacy statement on the homepage and other places 
we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what 
information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances 
we disclose it. We will use information in conformity with 
the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>

<p class="text">If we are going to use user information in a manner different 
from that stated at the time of collection we will notify 
users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or 
not we use their information in this different manner. However, 
if users have opted out of all communication with the site, 
or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be 
contacted, nor will their personal information be used in 
this new manner.</p>

<p class="text">If we make any material changes in our privacy practices that 
do not affect user information already stored in our database, 
we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying 
users of the change(s).</p>

<p class="text"><span class="textBold">Contact Information</span><br>
If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy 
policy, subscription status, or our web site please see our 
<b>About/Contact</b> page.</p>
