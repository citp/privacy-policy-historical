#### Privacy Policy

We recognize your right to confidentiality and pledge to protect your privacy. We are members of and adhere to the privacy guidelines of both the Canadian Marketing Association and the Canadian Centre of Philanthropy. ****

**Here's how we keep our pledge:**

__

_Overall._ We only collect personally identifying information (for example, user name, donor name, e-mail address, mailing address, employer, and telephone number, etc.) about registered users, donors or other Site users (collectively, the "Users") when knowingly provided by them. 

__

_Registration._ Personally identifiable information of Users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the User's prior consent. However, we may use registration or other information in the following ways: 

  * To guide development of new features and services relevant to Site Users; 
  * To provide advertisers with summary - never individual - information about our Site's overall usage patterns; and 
  * To focus advertising based on your preferences. 



HSFC will be pleased to inform you of the existence, any use, and disclosure of personally identifying information, and provide you with access to that Personal Information, within 30 (thirty) days of a receipt of a written request directed to HSFC Website Coordinator at 2300 Yonge Street, Suite 1300, Toronto, Ontario, M4P 1E4, subject to exceptions assigned by law. 

If you wish to have your email address deleted from our database, email us at [heartandstroke@hsf.on.ca](mailto:heartandstroke@hsf.on.ca) and include the EXACT words "CANCEL MAIL" in the body of your email. Please allow two to three business days for the actual cancellation to take effect. 

__

_Security._ HSFC uses Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption technology to ensure the integrity and privacy of the personal and credit card information you pass to us via the Internet when you make an online donation or place an order online. However, to take advantage of this, you must use a compatible browser. 

__

_Use of Cookies._ What is a cookie? Generally, cookies are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users and ease the ongoing access to and use of the website. They do not come onto a user's system nor do they pose a threat to a user's files. Users should be aware that HSFC cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or third parties hosting data for HSFC. Except as described herein, this Site does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties. However, if a User does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature. Please note that cookies may be necessary to provide the User with certain features (for example, customized delivery of information) available on HSFC's Site. 

__

_Opt-Out Options._ We give Users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include: 

  * Opting not to provide certain personal information when registering. 
  * Opting not to participate in Interactive Areas. 
  * Opting not to receive email from HSFC. 



You do not need to give personal information to receive information from this site.
