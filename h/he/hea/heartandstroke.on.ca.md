    1. **Limiting Collection of Personal Information**

    2. **Use, Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information**

Your personal information will not be used without your consent for purposes other than those for which it was collected or in accordance with applicable laws.  From time to time, we may wish to use personal information for new or additional purposes, in which case we will amend the Privacy Policy to include these new or additional purposes and will obtain your consent through your continued use of our Services. 

We retain your personal information only for as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to comply with our legal obligations. 

We may also use and disclose your personal information to third parties under the following limited circumstances:



  * with service providers that help with HSF’s operations and Services including, without limitation, for customer services, monitoring and analyzing Site activity, and operating and maintaining the Site. Such service providers and partner companies may only use your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;

    1. **Data Processors in Other Country**

To provide you with Services, we may use service providers, data processors and other third parties (“ **Third Parties** ”) to perform services on our behalf.  These Third Parties may store, process and transfer personal information on servers located outside of Canada in jurisdictions whose data protection laws may differ from those of Canada, which may include the United States of America.  As a result, personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to the laws in those jurisdictions.  For example, information may be shared in response to valid demands or requests from government authorities, courts and law enforcement officials in those countries. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require our Third Parties to maintain protections on personal information that are equivalent to those that apply in Canada. 

    2. **Links to Other Sites**

The Site may contain links to other websites or Internet resources, notably those belonging to our sponsors, partners or collaborators. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another website or Internet resource that may collect information about you voluntarily or through cookies or other technologies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any sites owned and operated by any third parties. Other sites may collect and treat information collected differently, so we encourage you to carefully read and review the privacy policy of each site you visit. 

    3. **Providing Credit Card Information on our Site**

If you make a credit card payment through HSF, we request the information reasonably needed by us to complete the processing of the transaction. For one-time payments, when you provide payment information, such as credit card numbers, credit card security codes, name on your credit card and expiration dates, we transmit this data directly from you to the credit card processing company; HSF only stores the credit card type, the last four digits of the credit card number and the expiration date in the event an incorrect payment needs to be refunded.  HSF will send you a confirmation email to confirm successful credit card charges.  For pre-authorized debits for recurring payments, all information is stored by HSF or Third Parties acting on our behalf, in an encrypted manner; i.e., coded data, such that only those who require access to update financial information can see the credit card number.  The encrypted data is provided at the appropriate intervals to the credit card processing company.  We may also share your personal information with Third Parties including credit card processing companies in order to bill you, but we do not provide any more information than reasonably necessary for this purpose. 

    4. **Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technology**

As you interact with the Services, we may use automatic data collection technology and services that record and collect information that identifies your computer, tracks your use of this Site and collects certain other information about you and your surfing habits.  This data collection technology may include cookies, web beacons and other similar devices on this Site to enhance functionality and navigation for our visitors. 

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer so that your computer will “remember” information when you visit a site.  Web beacons and tags are small strings of code that are used in conjunction with a cookie and allow us to record activity on our Site.  Internet tags, graphic tags and similar web beacon type functions allow us to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page or to access certain cookies. We may use web beacons on this Site to count users and to recognize users by accessing our cookies. Being able to access our cookies allows us to personalize this Site and improve your experience at this Site. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to determine which e-mail messages were opened.  

Information tracked through these mechanisms includes, but is not limited to: (i) your IP address; (ii) the type of web browser and operating system being used; (iii) the pages of the Site a user visits; and (iv) other sites a user visited before visiting this Site. 

You can reject or disable cookies by managing your browser settings and following the directions provided in your Internet provider’s help file. Please note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some customized features on this Site. Cookies and web beacons do not collect or contain your personal information. 

    5. **Google Analytics**

Our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google, Inc. (" **Google** "), or comparable technology. Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files stored on your computer, to analyze how you use our Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our Site (including your IP address) is sent to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of our Site, compile reports on Site activity for our Site operators and to provide other site activity related to internet services. Additionally, Google may transfer this information to a third party when required by law or in the case of a third-party processing information on Google's behalf. In no case will Google use your IP address in connection with any other information held by Google. You can set your internet browser to prohibit the installation of cookies, although we must point out that some features and functions of our Site will then be unusable.

The consent for collection and storage of data can be withdrawn at any time in the future by clicking on the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. Given the debate concerning the use of analytical tools using full IP addresses, we wish to point out that our Site uses the "Anonymize IP" function of Google Analytics which works with a shortened form of IP addresses to avoid direct personal identification. 

Furthermore, we use the cookies to carry out frequency assessments, page usage assessments and marketing assessments.  For the aforementioned assessments, we utilize this cookie information without a link to your personal information, so it is completely anonymous.
