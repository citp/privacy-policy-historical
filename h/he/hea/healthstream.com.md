This Policy has been created in order to demonstrate and inform you of our firm commitment to privacy and to outline how we deal with any personal data you provide while visiting this Site. If you do not agree with any portion of this Policy, you should not use this Site. This Policy applies only to information collected through this Site and not to information collected offline or through any other websites (even if affiliated with HealthStream or linked to by this Site).

### 1\. The Information We Collect.

Whenever you create a username and password, comment in a forum, or otherwise interact with the Site, HealthStream may collect information. There are two kinds of information websites can obtain about you: (a) Anonymous Information and (b) Personally Identifiable Information.

(a) Anonymous Information: is data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. Anonymous Information is aggregate data that websites use to administer their sites. This Anonymous Information comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, and may include such information as your browser type or your Internet Protocol (IP) address (if not deleted, clipped or anonymized). HealthStream may from time to time retain third parties to help us collect and aggregate Site information.

(b) Personally Identifiable Information: is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, the organization you represent, email address, or your telephone number. Similarly, to the extent that anonymous information is combined with Personally Identifiable Information, we treat the combined information as Personally Identifiable Information. For example, you may be asked to provide the following information:

Email Correspondence. Contained in the Site are links or forms that can be used to contact this Site so you can comment, make a complaint, make suggestions, and ask questions. Your email address is required on this form. HealthStream may put information from email on file, but does not currently share, sell, license, or transmit this information with third parties without express authorization from you.

User Accounts. To participate in certain features of the Site, we may request that you create an account by providing personal or organizational information (including, your name, the organization you represent, address, phone, and email) and creating a user ID and password. We will use this information to maintain your account. We may also use this information to send you announcements of new Site features, special offers, and promotional materials that we think may be of interest to you. You may elect not to receive such information by opting out as described below.

### 2\. How We Use Gathered Information.

HealthStream may use the information you share with us in the following ways:

(a) Anonymous Information: Anonymous Information is used internally for Site administration, troubleshooting, data analysis, auditing, and research to help improve the quality of this Site and its design.

From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about changes to our website Terms of Use, this Policy, or other policies or notices. In all cases, however, we will only use your information as permitted by law. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary.
