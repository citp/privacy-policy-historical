# Privacy Policy

Version 17.2 -- current as of: February 9, 2017

* * *

Privacy and data security are top priorities at HealthyWage. This document (the "Privacy Policy" or "Policy") presents a summary of the measures we take to ensure that we capture no more customer data than is absolutely necessary to effectively run our programs; that the data we collect is secured in a manner that exceeds industry and regulatory standards; and that we have processes in place to detect and properly handle any security breach, should one ever occur. The Policy applies to websites owned and operated by HealthyWage LLC, including www.healthywage.com.

### I. Introduction

HealthyWage creates and implements weight loss challenges and diet bets that employ gamification, financial incentives and prizes, positive peer pressure and other research-baed techniques to help make your weight loss plan more successful.  In particular, we run healthy weight loss challenges and programs that allow you to get paid to lose weight and even bet on your weight loss. Our programs require only minimal information from participants, as described below, and we safeguard that information very carefully.

### II. User Registration

Participants access our system and register for our programs by visiting our website at www.healthywage.com. The first time you sign in to HealthyWage, you will be asked to create an account; whether you do so is your choice. To create an account, you must provide personal information, including: first name, last name, email address, gender, date of birth, postal code, weight and height.

### III. Security of Your Personal Information

We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. For example, all participant data is collected and transmitted over secured connections using 256-bit encryption. All pages on the HealthyWage website are served over TLS. Our databases are isolated from the Internet and are accessed over a private network. All payment data is handled following rigorous Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards set by VISA, MasterCard, and American Express. All payment information is handled securely using the same encryption used by financial institutions. Our security processes and procedures are audited by third-party security firms to ensure we operate securely and follow industry best practices. Our hardware is stored under lock and key in secure, security-patrolled facilities at Rackspace (Rackspace is a high-end, industry-leading server hosting, maintenance and security firm).

All HealthyWage employees and contractors, regardless of their level of access to participant data, must complete our comprehensive training on security awareness, privacy, HIPPA compliance, general legal compliance and the HealthyWage Privacy & Data Security Policy and procedures. Each employee and contractor must review and sign the HealthyWage Participant Data Privacy Statement and a non-disclosure agreement before commencing work. Employees and contractors also receive ongoing training.

In order to foster an environment where participant privacy is taken very seriously, HealthyWage is clear about its policy that any employee or contractor who behaves in contravention of this Policy is subject to severe sanctions, including termination.

### IV. Data Access

Access to the participant information is on an “only as necessary” basis. Persons and entities (such a payment card processing companies) who require access to such information in the performance of their duties are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to honor these obligations.

Please note that if you are participating through your company, then your information may be further segregated, per the terms of our agreement with your company, and may not be accessible to anyone except for designated employees and contractors as required by our agreement with your company.

### V.  Data Transfers

Personal information collected by HealthyWage is stored and processed in the United States. HealthyWage may transfer data to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected. The destination countries may not have the same data protection laws and regulations as the country in which you initially provided the information. In such cases, HealthyWage will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Data that HealthyWage collects may be transferred from countries within the European Economic Area ("EEA") to countries outside the EEA. By submitting data on a HealthyWage website, you provide explicit consent to such EEA and other transborder transfers, including transborder transmission of data covered by this Privacy Policy.

HealthyWage complies with all applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of data from the EEA and Switzerland to other areas.  HealthyWage takes all required steps to ensure that recipients of such data provide adequate protection for your information; these steps include, among other things, contractual obligations for recipients to handle and protect such data in accordance with standard contractual clauses developed by the European Commission.

### VI. How We Use Your Personal Information

We use personal information collected through HealthyWage, including health and wellness information, to enable the services provided through HealthyWage and as described in this privacy statement. We do not use or disclose your information except as described in this privacy statement. In support of these uses, we may use personal information to: (i) provide you with important information about HealthyWage, including critical updates and notifications; (ii) send you email and/or mobile alerts and/or reminders; and (iii) modify your HealthyWage plan to better address your health needs and progress.

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements) and/or handle the processing of your account (including, but not limited to, discussing your personal information with third-party verifiers, references and whomever else we deem appropriate); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety and welfare of HealthyWage users or members of the public. If you are participating through a company, then HealthyWage may, at the request of such company, to the extent permitted by federal and state privacy laws and regulations, share participant information with the company.

### VII. How We Use Information That Is De-identified and/or Aggregated

HealthyWage team challenges are inherently non-private in certain limited ways. For example, other participants and participating employers (including your employer if you are participating through your employer) will be able to see certain aggregated information about your team, such as your team's aggregate percentage weight loss and rank within the challenge.

HealthyWage may also use de-identified and/or aggregated information gathered from HealthyWage, and related statistics, to improve the services provided by HealthyWage, and for certain research and analysis including clinical medical research. We may also provide this information to our partners for such purposes.

De-identified information does not include personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or address, but may include gender, height, weight, postal code, and medical information. Aggregated information is information from multiple users that is not associated with any individual user account. Please note that, if you are participating in HealthyWage through a company, the use of your data, even on a de-identified or aggregated basis, may be further restricted or not allowed at all, depending upon our agreement with your company.

### VIII. Deleting Records; Record Destruction

All waste copies of participant data generated in the course of copying, printing, or otherwise handling participant information are destroyed.

You can delete your account by sending an email to info@healthywage.com using the email address you used to create the account. Please put CANCEL in the subject line.

### IX. Email and Mobile Alerts

To comply with your reminder requests and to keep you informed of the latest improvements and alerts relating to your HealthyWage program, HealthyWage will send you emails, reminders and/or mobile alerts. You have the ability to opt out of receiving emails and/or reminders and/or mobile alerts.

### X. Review and Enforcement of This Policy

The HealthyWage Security and Privacy Committee (the “Committee”) is charged with developing, implementing, reviewing, assessing and enforcing HealthyWage’s privacy and data security policies and procedures. The Committee is comprised of members of HealthyWage’s senior management, and is chaired by Jimmy Fleming, Esq., HealthyWage’s Chief Information Security  Officer and General Counsel. Mr. Fleming serves as the contact person responsible for receiving complaints and providing individuals with information on HealthyWage’s privacy and data security practices. Mr. Fleming supervises the HealthyWage Information Security Manager.

HealthyWage will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy.  Any employee that HealthyWage determines is in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
