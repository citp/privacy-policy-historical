**Privacy Policy**

Heat Nation knows that you care about how your personal information is used and  
shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following  
to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are  
accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy covers Heat Nation’s treatment of personal information that  
Heat Nation gathers when you are on the Heat Nation website and when you use  
Heat Nation services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third  
parties that Heat Nation does not own or control, or to individuals that  
Heat Nation does not employ or manage.

Information Collected by Heat Nation

We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our  
website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and  
efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is  
incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of  
information from our Heat Nation users:

1\. Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you  
enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not  
to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to  
take advantage of many of our special features.

2\. Automatic Information:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact  
with us. Heat Nation and its authorized agents automatically receive and record  
certain “traffic data” on their server logs from your browser including  
your IP address, Heat Nation cookie information, and the page you requested.  
Heat Nation uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers,  
analyze trends and administer the website.  
o Heat Nation may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page  
has been viewed.

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.  
While Heat Nation will not be able to provide you with a personalized  
experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these  
programs are available.

E-mail Communications  
Heat Nation is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your  
email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as  
detailed in the “Sharing Your Information” section below. Heat Nation may send  
out e-mails with Heat Nation-related news, products, offers, surveys or  
promotions.

Cookies

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s  
hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your  
browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by  
how many people. Heat Nation cookies do not collect personal information, and  
we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal  
information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail  
address is.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct  
you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to  
command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to  
fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated  
because cookies allow you to use some of Heat Nation’s coolest features.

Heat Nation’s advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser that  
makes it possible to collect anonymous non-personally identifiable  
information that ad delivery systems use to present more relevant ads. If  
you would prefer to opt-out of this standard practice, please visit our  
advertising partner Platform-A’s privacy policy and opt-out page.

Sharing Your Information

Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to  
anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described  
below.

Heat Nation Personnel: Heat Nation personnel and authorized consultants and/or  
contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal  
course of Heat Nation business.

Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In  
these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the  
business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Heat Nation, or substantially  
all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the  
assets that is transferred.

Protection of Heat Nation and Others: We may release personal information when  
we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to  
enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the  
rights, property, or safety of Heat Nation, our employees, our users, or  
others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and  
organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Syndication: Heat Nation allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public  
content within the Heat Nation website.

With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your  
personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose  
incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and  
you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.

recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their  
parents’ permission before using Heat Nation or sending information about  
themselves or anyone else over the Internet.

discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to thePrivacy  
Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes
