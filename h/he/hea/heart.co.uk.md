We are Global, the Media & Entertainment group.

This Privacy Statement explains how we collect and use information about you when you interact with our radio, TV and digital brands and this website. This could be through smart speakers, when you enter one of our competitions or when you engage with our charity activities or sales channels.

Please note our [Global Player](http://www.globalplayer.com/) App has its own Privacy Statement which you can access here: <http://www.globalplayer.com/privacy-policy/>

Global is also the second largest festival operator in the UK with a portfolio including Victorious, Snowbombing, Festival No.6, Rewind, South West Four, Field Day, Boardmasters, Y Not, Truck, Hideout, Electric Elephant, Kendal Calling and Printworks. Global also has interests in Lost Village and Standon Calling and each festival has its own privacy policy.

Any personal information that you provide to us may be shared across our brands and may be used in the ways described in this Privacy Statement. 

When you click on adverts or links which take you away from any Global website or brand app, you should know that we have no control over the content or privacy practices of those other platforms.  We advise you to check their privacy policies before providing your information to them.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement or how we use your personal information please contact us at [privacy@global.com](mailto:privacy@global.com)

## **2.      ** **What information do we collect directly from you?**

The information we collect will vary depending on how you interact and engage with us but it is likely to include your name, address, phone number, email address, user name, password, age, gender, date of birth (if appropriate), competition and survey answers and any comments you have chosen to provide. 

If you call or email any of our stations, we may also collect your location and a brief summary of your contribution or opinion.

If you use any of our brand apps or listen through a connected device online or via a smart speaker, we will also collect the following information:

  * Your location – on your first use of our app, you will be asked if we can use your location in order to offer you services and information that is relevant to your area. We will also have information regarding your general geographic location based on your IP address and the GPS of your mobile device.


  * Your device – if you access our services or programmes via an app from a device such as a mobile phone, we will uniquely identify each instance of that use but we will not be able to personally identify you from this information.



 We will not normally collect any sensitive personal information from you, and will, in any event, ask for your express consent to hold this information if we need to do so.

## 3.     What do we use your information for?

We use your personal information:

  * To give you localised content and relevant adverts so you benefit from the best user experience;
  * To enable you to log in to your account;
  * To enable you to enter competitions on our websites;
  * To invite you to join our online research panel. If you participate, we will keep your views and any other content you provide on record, if you give your consent for us to do so;
  * To tell you about products, events, services and promotions that we or our third party partners are offering. This communication could be by email, phone, text or another form of electronic communication. We will only contact you if you have told us that you want to hear from us or our third party partners. If you are a registered user of a Global website, these communications may be personalised for you, based on your browsing preferences;
  * We will use your information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit our websites. This is known as online behavioural advertising (OBA). It works by giving you adverts based on the way you have interacted with the website. For example, if you have been clicking on articles about pop music, you may be shown more adverts for live pop music events. None of the OBA techniques used will collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number.



If you would like more information regarding OBA and how to opt out, please visit <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/>

By opting out of personalised advertising, you will still see adverts, but they will not be tailored to your interests. You can change your preferences by clicking here.

We will use your data either because you have consented for us to do so or because we have a legitimate interest in processing your information, as follows:
