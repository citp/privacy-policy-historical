   <h1>We respect your privacy</h1>
<p>At HealthNews, we take your privacy seriously. We will never use your
 personal information in a way that would identify you to an outside 
party and we will never sell or distribute the information you provide 
us without your express consent. </p>
<p>The Bottom Line: We don't like it when people misuse our personal 
information and we're going to make sure we don't misuse yours.</p>
<p>For the complete details about how we handle your private 
information, please read our privacy policy below. If you have any 
questions or concerns, please <a href="/Contact-Us/" target="_new">contact us.</a></p><h2>
HealthNews Privacy Policy </h2>
<div></div>
<p>Welcome to the website HealthNews.com, operated by Health News, Inc. 
(“HealthNews” or “us” or “we”).  The term “you” or “your” refers to the 
user or viewer of HealthNews.com, including any related websites 
maintained by HealthNews, such as the HealthNewsUS Twitter page 
(collectively, the “Sites”).</p>
<p>YOUR USE OF THE SITES OR PROVISION OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO 
HEALTHNEWS OR THROUGH THE SITES CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS 
POLICY.  DO NOT USE THE SITES OR PROVIDE INFORMATION (OR ALLOW OTHERS TO
 DO SO ON YOUR BEHALF) IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the Terms and 
Conditions of Use for the Sites (“TOU”), which is the contract between 
you and HealthNews governing use of the Sites.  Parts of the TOU affect 
this Privacy Policy; so, unless you have already done so, please review 
the <a href="http://www.healthnews.com/Terms" target="_new">Terms of Use</a> prior to 
using the Sites.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy
 Policy have the definitions provided in the TOU. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the information collected from you when
 visiting the Sites and how it may be used, including any further 
disclosure of such information to third parties.</p><h2>
Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>The term "Personally Identifiable Information" means your full name, 
physical address, email address, telephone number, or any other personal
 information that, alone or in combination with other information, 
permits us or third parties to identify or contact you physically or 
online.</p>
<p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to 
the Sites when you: (1) become a registered user; (2) create your 
personal profile; or (3) submit requests, suggestions, or other 
communications to us.  The information we typically will collect 
include:  (1) user name and (2) email address.  It is always your 
choice, or the choice of anyone acting for you, whether to provide 
Personally Identifiable Information. Do not provide Personally 
Identifiable Information about others without their permission. By 
submitting any Personally Identifiable Information about others, you 
represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.</p>
<p>The Personally Identifiable Information is primarily used for 
internal review, to improve content of the Sites, to notify visitors 
about updates to the Sites, and may be used by us to contact visitors 
for marketing purposes. Additionally, in the course of
 providing you with the services you find on the Sites, our web and 
application servers will automatically collect usage-related 
information, including the URLs that you access through the Sites, the 
date and time of your usage, your Internet protocol (IP) address, your 
Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exist pages, platform type, 
date/time stamp, number of clicks and your browser type.  We collect 
this information so we can perform effective capacity planning, 
administer the Sites, troubleshoot the Sites’ performance, track users’ 
movements in the aggregate, gather demographic information for aggregate
 use and accurately document revenue-generating transactions for our 
business partners.</p><h2>
Third Parties with Whom We May Share Information</h2>
<p>We may disclose any non-public Personally Identifiable Information 
and usage-related information about you to nonaffiliated third parties 
without your consent for the conduct of our business, for commercial 
purposes, or as required or permitted by law, such as, (1) to respond to
 a subpoena or court order, judicial process, law enforcement or 
regulatory authorities; (2) in connection with a proposed or actual 
sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of business or an 
operating unit; (3) to consumer reporting agencies; or (4) prevent fraud
 or other illegal activities from being perpetrated.  Any commercial use
 of the above-mentioned information will comply with the requirements of
 the CAN-SPAM Act.</p>
<p>We may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to insurance companies for the purposes of making a claim.</p>
<p>We may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to affiliated companies or business successors to HealthNews.</p>
<p>We may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to any third 
party whom you have consented to receive your personal information.</p>
<h2>Links </h2>
<p>The Sites may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible 
for the privacy practices, the terms and conditions of use, or any of 
the content of such sites. The linked sites may collect Personally 
Identifiable Information from you that is not subject to our control. 
The data collection practices of linked sites will be governed by that 
site’s privacy policy</p><h2>
Security Measures</h2>
<p>We are committed to maintaining the security of information under our
 control.  To safeguard and secure the information we collect, we have 
put in place appropriate security procedures and controls.  Please be 
aware that no security measures are perfect, and we cannot control the 
actions of third parties with whom you choose to share information.  We 
are not responsible for circumvention of any security measures by third

Public Areas</h2>
<p>Any information that you choose to disclose in public areas on the

risk.</p><h2>
Cookies </h2>
<p>We may use Cookies to monitor the Sites’ usage, advertisement 
viewing, and performance and to personalize the content of various areas
 within the Sites.  The information collected by Cookies (i) helps us 
dynamically generate advertising and content on the Sites or in 
newsletters, (ii) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are
 using the Sites and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites, (iii) 
how many people open our emails, and (iv) for what purposes these

Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not want to collect information from children.  Do not provide 
any Personally Identifiable Information unless you are at least 13 years

and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete it from our 
database, subject to applicable law and this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>

may be used to identify you when you refer a friend to the Sites.  We 
also reserve the right to transfer the email addresses we collect to any
 successor in interest.</p><h2>

<h2>European Union Data Considerations</h2>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Sites may be 
stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which 
HealthNews or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain 
facilities, and by using the Sites, you consent to any such transfer of 
information outside of your country.</p><h2>

material changes and the effective date of those changes will be posted 
on the Sites.  One of your responsibilities is to review this Privacy 
Policy regularly to ensure that you are apprised of any changes.  The 
Privacy Policy in effect at the time you provide your Personally

Personally Identifiable Information.  Your continued use of the Sites 
after we post any material changes to this Privacy Policy signifies your
 acceptance of its terms, as modified.</p><h2>
