<h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
<p>For the purposes of this privacy policy, the terms "we", "us", "our" and "HealthCare.com" refer to the HealthCare.com, Inc. The terms "you" and "user" refer to you as a user of this Site.</p>
<p>At HealthCare.com we care about your privacy as much as you do. We commit ourselves to bring you, as a member of Healthcare.com, the best site experience we can offer in a way that assures that your personally identifiable information is safe with us.</p>
<p><strong>1. Collection and Use of Information</strong><br>
In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.

However, we may collect and store certain information automatically. This information will not be shared with anyone beyond the web site support staff, except when required by law enforcement investigation, and will be used only as a source of anonymous statistical information.</p>

<li>HealthCare.com, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on HealthCare.com.</li>
</ul><br>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
HealthCare.com collects no personally identifiable information about you when you visit our web site unless otherwise stated or unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, HealthCare.com.com does collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong><br>
In order to use some areas of this web site, you must first complete the registration form. If you as choose to register for "Take Control of Your Health" and "Advertise with Us", we request certain personally identifiable information from you such as your email address, gender, age and zip code.

<p><strong>Public Display of PII</strong><br>
If you choose to post a user review on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these reviews, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

<p><strong>2. Communications from the Site</strong><br>
From time to time, we send email communications to registered users to confirm of completed transactions and provide site updates.</p>
<p><strong>Promotional Communications</strong><br>
From time to time, we make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages. When visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information</p>
<p><strong>3. Cookies</strong><br>
A "cookie" is a piece of information that our web site sends to your browser, which then is stored on your system. You may disable or delete cookies at any moment. We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>4. IP Addresses</strong><br>
Our Web server receives your IP address and other information as a normal function of the HTTP protocol. This data is stored in standard Web logs and used for aggregate statistics. No attempt is made to match your IP address with email addresses or any other information.</p>
<p><strong>5. Security</strong><br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Our site contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Users should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
<p>HealthCare.com uses technology provided by a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit this Web site. This technology may use information about your visit to this Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this Web site, such third-party advertising technology may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please visit &lt;http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy&gt;. In addition, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.</p>
<p>HealthCare.com may also use a third party ad network provider to help present advertisements on this Web site. Third-party ad serving enables HealthCare.com to target advertisements to you for products and services you might be interested in. These third party network advertisers, along with other advertisers and sponsors on the Web site, may use cookies, web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) or similar technologies (and, in the case of cookies, access them on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser) to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicated advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed and other clickstream data. The use of third party cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by these ad network providers is governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. Please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad networks we may use.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of PII with Third-Parties</strong><br>
We may contract with third-party companies or persons to provide certain services including credit card processing, distribution, data management, promotional services, etc. ("Service Providers"). We provide our Service Providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. We also ask our Service Providers to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours.</p>
<p>We use PayPal to provide credit card processing on our site. For Professional Registrations, users who sign up to purchase listings on the HealthCare.com directory will share their name, address, phone, email, and credit card numbers as necessary for PayPal to provide that service.</p>
<p><strong>7. How to unsubscribe</strong><br>
