### Non-personal Information

To help us effectively run our website and business, our website collects non-personal information or aggregated information (which doesn’t identify an individual) from those who use it. For example, Google Analytics collects information about our website visitors, but the information is processed so that an individual cannot be identified from it because we work in accordance with their guidelines, so personal data should not be used or shared with them. Website searches may be powered by third parties but are anonymised.
