<p>This is how I will handle information I learn about you from your visit to my website. It is based on how I want to be treated when I visit other websites. The information I receive depends upon what you do when visiting my site.</p>
<h2>Summary Of Following Information</h2>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information gathered on this site is not sold or otherwise shared with any third parties. If you continue to use this website, you agree to our terms and conditions as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>Detailed Privacy Policy
</li><li>If You Identify Yourself
</li><li>Third Party Providers
</li><li>Use Of Trademarks

</li></ul><p></p>
<h2>Detailed Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>I have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate my firm commitment to privacy. In particular, the Policy sets forth my information gathering and dissemination practices with respect to this web site. The Policy applies only to data collected on-line.</p>
<h2>If You Identify Yourself</h2>
<p>I want to be very clear: I will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to me. 
</p><p>You may decide to send me personally identifying information, for example, in an email. Each time you do so, I will use this information to better serve you.</p> 
<p>When you do provide personally identifiable information I may use it to send you product announcements or tips on getting more benefit from my products, surveys regarding current services or potential new services that may be offered, as well as to send you event notices and announcements, and promotional materials regarding specific programs, products, and services. If you no longer wish to receive such messages an unsubscribe option is placed in every piece of correspondence you receive from me.</p><p>If applicable, every time you purchase a product on my web site you will receive order acknowledgment emails, and if applicable, product fulfillment emails. If the product you purchase is a teleseminar or other event, you will receive event details via email.</p><p>I take commercially appropriate measures to safeguard the personally identifiable information that you share with me. As such, I use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>
<h2>Third Party Providers</h2>
<p>I may occasionally enlist vendors to provide services on my behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of my services. I will only provide those vendors with the personally identifiable information that they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>I may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, however, your personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number, etc.) is not transferred to the third party.</p>
<p>I use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here.</a></p><p>

<h2>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
<p>I may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable my systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites pages, or register with any of my site's services, a cookie enables my site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.</p>

They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of a web site.</p>
<p>I may serve third party advertisements that use cookies and web beacons in the course of ads being served on my web site to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable information you give is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information on the web site.</p>
<h2>Release of Information</h2>
<p>If healing-crystals-for-you.com is sold, the information I have obtained from you through your voluntary participation in my site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue. In that event, you will receive notice through my website of that change in control and practices, and I will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser honors any opt-out requests you might make of us.</p>
