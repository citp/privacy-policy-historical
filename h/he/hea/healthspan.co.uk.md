# Privacy Policy | Healthspan

**Customer charter**

Healthspan understands that many customers value their personal privacy and wish to ensure that any company who provides a service to them will also value their privacy. We therefore guarantee that we will not sell or pass your data to a third party outside the Healthspan Group, in the normal course of business, unless that third party requires the data to provide you with your order or in the course of communicating with you as a customer. As part of our customer charter we will process your personal data fairly and lawfully.

**Data that we collect**

To enable us to process your order we will ask you to provide personal details such as:

Name   
Email address  
Password  
Address  
Payment details

 **IP Addresses and Cookies**

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. This information is collected for our internal purposes only and shall not be disclosed to any other organisation except as required by law. We may use "cookies" to collect this information and track your use of this website. For more information about "cookies", please see the Interactive Advertising Bureau's website: http://www.allaboutcookies.org. If you do not agree you can choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before you accept a cookie.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.

**How we use your data**

Our primary purpose in using your data is to provide you with your order. We may analyse your data (or provide your data to agents who are contracted to supply services to us) to create a data profile to enable us to provide a better service to you. 

We will keep all your personal information provided by you confidential except that we may use personal information for any of the following purposes:

  * Administration, general correspondence, support, profiling and processing (including personalising the Site for your use);
  * Contacting you to register your use of the Site, to advise you of any special offers, to notify you of new features or to resolve any queries you or we may have regarding us or the Site or its use;
  * Responding to any requests or queries from you;
  * Profiling you and the users of the Site;
  * Contacting you to notify you of other services or products that might be of interest to you (although you can elect not to receive any of these at any time by contacting us as set out below); and
  * Subscribing you to our newsletters or email alerts or online surveys (although you can unsubscribe from these at any time by contacting us as set out below)



**Your consent to processing data**

By Law we are required to obtain your consent to processing your data. We will assume that you have given your consent to the uses outlined above if you provide us with any data via our web sites or via replies to advertisements. You can advise us that you wish to withdraw your consent by sending us an email explaining the situation to [info@healthspan.co.uk](mailto:info@healthspan.co.uk).

Where we process or transfer your data outside of what is outlined in "How we use your data" we will ask you to provide your specific consent.

**How we protect your data**

The data that you have provided will remain in databases that are established in a network that is firewall protected. Firewalls exist to stop the transfer of unauthorised information to or from the network. Physical access to our servers is restricted through the use of door code security systems. Higher level user login ID and password controls are also in place to restrict access. Only a limited number of IT personnel are authorised by the IT director to access the database. We use industry standard security technology and server certification.

As a routine we carry out validation checks to help prevent fraud. No protection system is foolproof and the company cannot guarantee the total security of data or accept any liability unless a breach of security was due to our proven wilful default or negligence. Certain web sites linked to our site may not offer the same protections as the NutriProfile site and the laws of some countries outside the Channel Islands or the EU to which your data may be transferred as part of the process of providing products and services to you, may not offer the same data protection.

**Customer choice**

You can update your data or ask us to delete your data at anytime by sending an E-mail to [info@healthspan.co.uk](mailto:info@healthspan.co.uk).

We promise to try to delete or update your information promptly.

**Customer charter**

Healthspan operates a no quibble refund policy on all our products. We also guarantee that we will not sell or pass your data to a third party outside the Group, in the normal course of business, unless that third party requires the data to fulfill your order.
