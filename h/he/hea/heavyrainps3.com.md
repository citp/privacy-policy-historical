This website is operated by, or on behalf of, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited of 10 Great Marlborough Street, London W1F 7LP, United Kingdom ("SCEE"). We operate, or have operated on our behalf, a number of websites, some of which give you an opportunity to register or provide us with personal information about yourself. Registration may be required to access certain features or promotions. This cookies and privacy policy explains how this information is used and how to contact us if you have any queries or concerns.

**1\. What kind of information do we collect?**

If you choose to register on our sites, we may ask you for information such as name, email address, postal address, age, gender, telephone number and product information. Our sites may include optional surveys, asking for your views on various products and services. If you download content from our sites, we will automatically check your hardware details. If you use community tools, we may store the content and communications which you send and receive, and we reserve the right to monitor your communications. We may also detail your activity and personal preferences when visiting our sites (see "Cookies", below).

Please always obtain consent first before giving us anyone else's personal information (for example, for send-a-friend promotions). Please make sure that any personal details which you provide are accurate and current, and let us know if there are any changes.

**3\. Who else has access to your information?**

Our affiliated companies, local distributors and other organisations who work for us may have access to your information in order to manage that information for us and to provide you with information and services requested by you. Some of these companies may process your information in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), such as the United States and Japan. Data protection laws in these countries may not offer the same level of protection as in the EEA. If you are not happy for us to transfer your information in this way, you should not access and use our websites.

In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose your personal information if required by law or to protect or defend ourselves or others against illegal or harmful activities. If our business is sold or restructured, your details may be transferred as part of the business.
