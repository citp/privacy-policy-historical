#### Why should I read it?

#### How does HealthTap treat privacy differently?

When we say we care about your privacy, we mean it. Privacy policies are important documents, but many people don't read them because they are long, confusing, and written in "legalese."

We've designed our Privacy Statement with you in mind, creating links to the most common questions about HealthTap and HealthTap Premium Services (including Prime and Concierge) and how these services work where privacy issues may be involved. Everything in written in plain, easy to understand language.

This Privacy Statement describes what information you can share with us, how that information is stored, how we use that information, and what information other members and doctors can see when they use HealthTap and HealthTap Prime.

In addition to this Privacy Statement, we've created a [Privacy Constitution and User Bill of Rights](https://web.archive.org/terms/privacy_sharing) that describes our core beliefs about privacy and your core rights as a user of our services. These documents are located on our [Privacy and Secure Sharing](https://web.archive.org/terms/privacy_sharing) page, which includes suggestions for how to share securely and anonymously on HealthTap. 

## Introduction

HealthTap and HealthTap Prime connect you with leading doctors, trusted health information, answers, and tips, and even virtual consultations, all designed to help you feel good and live a happier, healthier life.

By continuing to use HealthTap, you agree to this Privacy Statement and any updates to it. This means that if the Privacy Statement changes, you agree to these changes if you keep using HealthTap. When this policy is changed (other than for typographical corrections or minor changes that do not alter its meaning), we will update the "last modified" date at the top of the policy. We may provide a summary at the bottom of the policy, describing the types of changes made.
