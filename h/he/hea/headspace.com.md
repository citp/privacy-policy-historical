# Beatnik - Privacy Statement

BEATNIK, INC.

Beatnik, Inc. knows that users of the Beatnik.com site (the "Site") value their privacy. In that vein, our goal is to create a safe online environment of trust and community with our users. The following privacy policy discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Site. 

1\. What personal information is gathered about you and how do we use it?

In general, personal information is collected for the purpose of enhancing your experience at this Site and will not be shared or disclosed without your consent. 

We ask you to register before allowing you to use certain features of our Site, for instance when you license and download music or software, when you save music tracks in your project area "My Projects" or when you upload and post content on the Site. As part of the registration process, we ask you to provide your full name, email address and phone number. You will also choose a username and a password which you can use during your future sessions when logging in on the Site. Registration information is needed to track and verify compliance with the Terms of Use applicable to the Site, as well as with federal, state and local laws. We may also ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Beatnik, Inc. and/or our affiliates, on our feedback forms or when you report a problem with the Site. We may also ask you to complete surveys for research purposes. 

When purchasing products, services or licenses to music or software, you will also be required to provide your street address and credit card/financial information, if applicable. Ordering information is needed to verify your identity and for the purchase and sale of products, services or licenses ordered through the Site. Credit card/financial information that is collected is used to charge you for products, services and licenses you purchase. We may use your telephone number to contact you in order to resolve shipping problems. We will never use your telephone number for sales or marketing purposes. 

We use "cookies" during your visit to the Site. "Cookies" are text files sent from our server and stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow us to personalize and save preferences. Cookies can be used to collect anonymous data and serve the user with specifically targeted ads. We do not use cookies to read any data or files in your computer. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent that. 

The Site server automatically collects data about your home server's domain when you visit the Site. For example, if you visit us from your Yahoo account, our server will record a visit from Yahoo.com. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us, e.g., an affiliate web site or a search engine. We use this information for the purposes of tracking the web site that referred you to us and we sometimes provide this information in aggregated non-personally identifiable form to our affiliates. Our server will not automatically record your name or e-mail address. Your e-mail address and other personally identifying data will not be known to Beatnik unless you voluntarily submit them to us or post them on a message/bulletin board. 

Lastly, we may collect IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are navigating the Internet. Internet servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site but never for marketing or tracking purposes. 

Occasionally, we may use the information you submit to send you special offers or other information. If you prefer, you can choose not to receive such information from Beatnik by indicating to us your preference by unchecking the appropriate box at the time you provide to us the requested information, or at any time by sending an email message opting out to care@beatnik.com. 

More generally, the personal information you give us allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout and services. However, for these purposes, we only use your personal information on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you. 

By providing any personal information to the Site, users, including without limitation users in the European Union, acknowledge that they fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States. 

2\. With whom is your information shared?

As a general rule, we do not share or disclose your personal information with or to any third party unless we have your explicit permission to do so. For example, if you request that we sign you up for a third party's newsletter, we will provide your personal information to such third party so that they can add you to the newsletter distribution list. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy policies of such third parties. 

We disclose aggregated, non-personally identifiable information to advertisers and others for marketing and promotional purposes, without disclosing to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you. Certain information, such as your password, credit card number and bank account number, are not disclosed to advertisers or for marketing or promotional purposes at all. 

In addition, we reserve the right to disclose any content, records or electronic communication of any kind (including without limitation personal information or private electronic communication transmitted on the Site): (i) to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary to operate our business; or (iii) to protect the rights or property of Beatnik or its users, sponsors, providers, licensors or merchants. We also reserve the right to reject any order or to request additional information from any user. 

3\. What are your choices regarding how collected information is used?

We always give you the opportunity and right to opt out of receiving communications or promotional materials from Beatnik, Inc. on the registration form by unchecking the appropriate box or by sending us an email opting out that includes your full name and email address to care@beatnik.com. 

4\. What safeguards are in place to protect your personal information?

Beatnik, Inc. uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to maintain the confidentiality of the information we collect online. The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our Site and servers are protected using standard industry practice. We review and update web security and security procedures regularly. 

Information we collect for transactions, whether purchase or license transactions, is encrypted using secure server software. 

Although we will exercise reasonable care to maintain the confidentiality of the personal information we collect online, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that the personal information you submit to us will be free from unauthorized third party intrusion. You therefore understand and agree that all information you submit to Beatnik or post on the Site is done so at your own risk. 

5\. How can you update or correct inaccuracies?

Upon request via email at care@beatnik.com, we will provide to you a summary of any personal information retained by us regarding you. You may also modify, correct, change or update your personal records or cause your personal records to be removed from our database by request via email to care@beatnik.com. We will only send personal records to the email address on file for the visitor name associated with it. 

6\. What about other sites linked from the Site?

You should be aware that when you are on the Site, you can be directed to other sites that we do not control. These other sites may send their own cookies, collect data or solicit personal information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party sites. 

7\. What about information you post on the Site?

If you post information on, or transmit information to other people through, the Site, including without limitation, on message/bulletin boards on the Site, you understand that such information will be publicly available and you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality regarding such information.
