  <p class="MsoBodyText">The Site is controlled and operated by Company from the
    United States; accordingly, this Policy, and our collection, use and disclosure
    of your Personally Identifiable Information, is governed by U.S. law, and not
    by the laws of any country, territory or jurisdiction other than that of the

    available for use in any particular jurisdiction.&nbsp; Those who choose to access the Site <span class="GramE">do</span> so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for
    complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.&nbsp; You are also subject to United States export controls in
    connection with your use of the Site and/or Site-related services, and are
    responsible for any violations of such controls, including without limitation
    any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting

    jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.&nbsp; By using the Site and submitting any
    Personally Identifiable Information, visitors from outside of the United States
    acknowledge that the Site is subject to United States law and consent to the
    transfer of Personally Identifiable Information to the United States, which may
    provide a different level of data security than in their country of residence,
    and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws.<b> </b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="">Note Regarding the Use
    of the Site by Children: </span></b><span style="">The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13),

    Company Collect From Me?&nbsp; </span></b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="">Company gathers two basic types of
    information through the Site: "<b>Personally
    Identifiable Information</b>" (or "<b>PII</b>") and "<b>Non-Personally
    Identifiable Information</b>" (or "<b>Non-PII</b>").&nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you
    as an individual; that is, your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail
    address, credit card number or other payment account number.&nbsp; Non-Personally Identifiable Information
    is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other
    information that does not reveal your specific identity. </span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"> <b><span style=";"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b> <b><span style="">Personally Identifiable
    Information.&nbsp; </span></b><span style="">You do not have to provide PII to
    use the Site.&nbsp; However, in order
    for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site
    (for example, to sign up for a newsletter or to view certain areas of the
    Site), we may require that you furnish PII.&nbsp; We collect PII from you through the Site only when you
    voluntarily provide it to us.<b> </b></span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"> <b><span style=";"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b> <b><span style="">Non-Personally Identifiable
    Information.&nbsp; </span></b><span style="">When you visit and interact with the
    Site, Company and third parties with whom Company has contracted to provide
    services to Company may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site
    pages you visit).&nbsp; Non-PII is
    generally collected through the Site from five different sources:&nbsp; <span class="GramE">server log</span> files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar
    technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.&nbsp; <b> </b></span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"> <b><span style=";">i.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b> <b><span style="">Server Log Files.&nbsp; </span></b><span style="">Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is
    automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet
    Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; This
    number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever
    you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s)
    that you visited.&nbsp; We use your IP
    address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating
    Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and
    administering the Site.&nbsp; Collecting
    IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by
    many web sites. </span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"> <b><span style=";">ii.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b> <b><span style="">Environmental Variables.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp; <span class="GramE">We and our service providers</span> may
    also collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address,
    computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet
    browser, and Internet browser version.&nbsp; These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be
    used to optimize your experience on the Site. </span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"> <b><span style=";">iii.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b> <b><span style="">Cookies.&nbsp; </span></b><span class="GramE"><span style="">We and our service providers</span></span><span style=""> may use “cookies” on the Site.&nbsp; Cookies are data that a web server
    transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping purposes.&nbsp; Cookies are an industry standard used by
    most web sites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a
    particular web site; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or
    files.&nbsp; If you do not want
    information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure
    in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be
    given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie,
    or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"> <b><span style=";">iv.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b> <b><span style="">Pixel Tags.&nbsp; </span></b><span style="">We and our service providers may also use so-called
    "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear <span class="SpellE">GIFs</span>" or similar means (collectively, "<b>Pixel Tags</b>") in connection with
    some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things,
    compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.&nbsp; A Pixel Tag is an electronic image,
    often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and
    may be associated with Cookies on the visitors’ hard drives.&nbsp; Pixel Tags allow us to count users who
    have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to
    help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.&nbsp; When used in HTML-formatted e-mail
    messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been
    opened. </span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"> <b><span style=";">v.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b> <b><span style="">Information That You Voluntarily
    Provide.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp; Company also collects Non-PII (<i>e.g.</i>, your interests, your geographic
    location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us.&nbsp; When such information is not combined
    with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does not
    personally identify you or any other user.&nbsp; Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the <span class="GramE">end-product</span> does not personally identify you or any
    other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage
    of our users who like a particular artist.&nbsp; Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for
    purposes of this Policy. </span></p>
