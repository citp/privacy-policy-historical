**We know your privacy is important to you and HeartBeat.my is committed to protecting your information.

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law and when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process. 

**What we do with your information**  
The private information that you give us when you place an order or utilize one of our special services is used to process and fulfill your order or request. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more helpful and relevant to you.
