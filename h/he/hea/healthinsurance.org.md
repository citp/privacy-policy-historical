# healthinsurance.org™ privacy policy

This privacy policy discloses the information privacy practices for the Web site you are currently visiting. You may contact healthinsurance.org™ [via e-mail through this form](http://www.healthinsurance.org/contact/) or via postal mail at healthinsurance.org™ LLC, 8009 34th Ave. South, Suite 360, Minneapolis, MN  55425.

## your privacy and health insurance quotes

We link to sites which provide individual health insurance quotes. The product, your ZIP code and availablity in your area determine which options we display. We choose partners using several criteria, most importantly your convenience and privacy:

  * no hassle: shop online, no agent will call
  * comparison shopping: side-by-side pricing/plans from multiple providers
  * mimimum personal information: in most cases just your zip code, birth date and gender



In some ZIP codes, where no online individual health insurance quote is available, we may show you sponsored listings.

## sponsored listings

For most other products, including Medicare, entering your ZIP code in our form will present you with a page of sponsored listings. Here is an [example of sponsored listings](http://www.healthinsurance.org/quotes/?prodid=210&ad_type=3&zip=55044&source=homepage&-v=3). Healthinsurance.org uses an outside service to manage these sponsored listings. Each sponsored site has its own privacy policy - be a wise consumer and be aware that providing your contact information to these sites give them permission to call or e-mail you.

## no disclosure of your personal information

healthinsurance.org™ only collects personal information from you in these instances:

  * if you use [this form](http://www.healthinsurance.org/contact/) to contact us, we only use your information to reply and do not share it
  * in select ZIP codes a pilot project connects you with insurance agent in your area.



In the case of the pilot project, you may be contacted by healthinsurance.org™ in a followup survey to determine your satisfaction with this process.
