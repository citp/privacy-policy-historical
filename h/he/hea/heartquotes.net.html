                      <p>HeartMath LLC ("HMLLC"), Institute of HeartMath,  (IHM) and Quantum Intech, (QI) recognize the importance of protecting the  privacy of all information provided by users of our web sites, subscribers to  our mailing lists, registrants for our events, participants in our surveys and  contests and all of our customers. We have created this policy out of a  fundamental respect for our users' right to privacy and to guide our  relationships with our customers. This Privacy Policy statement discloses the  privacy practices for all products and services owned by HMLLC, IHM and QI.</p>
                        <b>Information Collection and Usage</b>
                        <p>HMLLC, IHM and QI collect information from our website  users, subscribers and customers. In this section of our privacy policy, we will  describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide better  services to our customers. </p>
                        <b>Registration and Ordering</b>
                        <p>During registration, users are required to give their  contact information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone  number). We also may collect demographic information (such as job title and  purchasing responsibilities, company information and professional  certification). For internal purposes, we use this information to communicate  with users and provide requested services, and, for our website visitors, to  provide a more personalized experience on our sites. We use aggregate  demographic information about our visitors to improve our service, for  marketing purposes and/or industry reporting purposes.</p>
                        <p>For our services that require payment (such as certain  events, products and subscriptions), we also collect credit card information  (such as account name, number and expiration date), which is used for billing  purposes only, and is not otherwise shared. &nbsp;Please see the “Security” section below.</p>
                        <b>E-mail Newsletters</b>
                        <p>If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask  for contact information (such as name, e-mail address and, occasionally,  demographic information). We use this information in the same manner as we use  contact information in the registration and ordering process described above.  Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at  the end of the e-mail newsletter or by sending an e-mail to  optout@heartmath.com with the e-mail address used to subscribe.</p>
                        <b>Surveys and Contests</b>
                        <p>From time to time we invite users to provide information via  surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely  voluntary and the user therefore has a choice as to whether or not to disclose  requested contact information (such as name and mailing address) and  demographic information (such as zip code or job title). In addition to other  uses set forth in this policy, contact information collected in connection with  surveys and contests is used to notify the winners and award prizes, to monitor  or improve the use and satisfaction of the site, and may be shared with  sponsors of such surveys or contests. </p>
                        <b>Interactive Features</b>
                        <p>At some of our sites, we offer interactive and community  features such as discussion boards, webcasts and user profiles. Note that all  personal information sent or posted via such features becomes public  information for which HMLLC, IHM and QI are not responsible and cannot be held  accountable. </p>
                        <b>“Tell-A-Friend”</b>
                        <p>If users elect to use our referral service for informing a  friend about our sites and services, we may ask them for the friend's name, job  title and e-mail address. HMLLC, IHM or QI will store and use this information  to send the friend an invitation. This information may also be used to provide  information about our company and related products and services. The friend may  contact us as specified in the tell-a-friend message to request that no further  communications be sent. </p>
                        <b>Communications with Us</b>
                        <p>We have features where users can submit information to us  (such as our feedback forms). Letters to the editor and similar submissions may  be made public. Requests for service, support or information may be forwarded  as needed to best respond to a specific request. We may retain e-mails and  other information sent to us for our internal administrative purposes, and to  help us to serve customers better. </p>
                        <b>Communications from Us: Service Updates, Special Offers</b>
                        <p>In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates  that contain important information about our sites and services. For example,  we send new members a welcoming message, and verify password and username for  our password-protected sections. We may also communicate with a user to provide  requested services and for account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular  mail. </p>
                        <p>We offer our users the option to receive information about  our company, related products, services and special deals. Users can choose not  to receive these communications, as set forth in our Permission section below. </p>
                        <b>Automatic Data Collection</b>
                        <p>Our web sites have features that automatically collect  information from users, to deliver content specific to users' interests and to  honor their preferences. This information assists us in creating sites that  will serve the needs of our users. &nbsp;One  of the most common ones is the “cookie.”</p>
                        <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive  containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to  any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes  their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Our Web shopping cart utilizes  cookies to facilitate the ordering process.</p>
                        <p>We use "cookies," containing information about the  user’s online session in order to benefit the user by requiring login only  once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookies, they  may be limited in the use of some areas of our site. For example, the user may  not be able to place an order in our online store. We may additionally note  some of the pages the user visits on our site through the use of pixel tags  (also called clear gifs). The use of cookies and pixels enable us to track and  target the interests of our users to enhance their experience while on our  sites. </p>
                        <p>Some of our business affiliates may use cookies on our sites  in ads or promotions. However, HMLLC, IHM and QI have <u>no access to, no  control over and accept no responsibility for</u> these business affiliates'  cookies, information gathering practices or usage of said information; we urge  users to read their specific privacy policies in this regard. </p>
                        <p>Our web sites contain links to other sites. HMLLC, IHM and  QI are not responsible and shall not be held accountable for the privacy  practices or content of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware  when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site to  which we may link that may collect personally identifiable information.</p>
                        <p>For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser  type, navigation history and the IP address of all visitors to our site. This  information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. We  use this information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and  system administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our  user base for aggregate use. </p>
                        <p>We may combine demographic information supplied by a  subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide general profiles, in  aggregate non-personally identifiable form, about our users and their  preferences in the content of the site and advertising. We may share this  composite information with our advertisers and business affiliates to help them  better understand our services. </p>
                        <b>With Whom Your Information is Shared</b>
                        <p>When we have co-branded, customized, private label, “powered  by” or sponsored products and services, or when we join with other parties to  provide specific services, we may share (provide and receive) personal  information with them. We do not share credit card information with such third  parties. </p>
                        <p>We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a  credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These  companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable  information for any secondary purposes.</p>
                        <p>Other than as set forth above, we do not share personally  identifiable information with other companies, apart from those acting as our  agents in providing our product(s)/service(s), and which agree to use it only  for that purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. Also, our  parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies, entities into which our companies  may be merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or  operations may be transferred, will be able to use personal information. </p>
                        <p>We will also disclose information we maintain when required  to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or  other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or  in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against  someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally  or unintentionally) our rights or property. Users should also be aware that  courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority  under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or  transferred to third parties without permission. </p>
                        <b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b>
                        <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes  (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our product(s)/service(s),  we provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data. The user  should contact Customer Support for the applicable product or service.</p>
                        <b>Security</b>
                        <p>We use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal  information and to store it securely. &nbsp;Since  HeartMath.com went live in 1995, there has never been a confirmed case of fraud  or identity theft reported by our customers as a result of a credit card  purchase made with us.</p>
                        <p>All credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site  to protect you from any loss, misuse or alteration of information collected, so  that you can buy with confidence.</p>
                        <p>When you place an order online at HeartMathStore.com, the  information you send to us is protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)  technology. &nbsp;SSL encrypts your order  using strong 128-bit encryption to prevent the decoding of that information by  anyone other than HeartMathStore.com. as it travels over the Internet.&nbsp; SSL is the industry standard in transferring credit  card information to process your orders. The SSL encryption translates your  order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed  immediately.</p>
                        <p>When you've finished shopping and begin the checkout  process, you will move into the secure area of our site. A warning window may  pop up to notify you that you are entering this "safe" area. Once  you've entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let  you know you are in a secure area. A key or a closed lock will appear in the  lower left hand corner of your screen and/or the right side of the address bar  in Internet Explorer to notify you of this change. (In Netscape, it's in the  lower left-hand corner, just above the Start button. On a Mac, the lock icon  may be in the lower left-hand corner of both browsers.)&nbsp; You will remain in this secure area for the  entire checkout process.</p>
                        <p>Since secure connections are slower than unsecured  connections, we only use them at check out, when you're sending us personal  information.</p>
                        <p>If your browser doesn't support SSL, you'll be unable to  connect to our secure shopping cart server, which means you needn't worry about  mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. If you can't  access the secure server, for whatever reason, we offer many other options for  placing an order. You may place your order by sending it via e-mail to: <a href="mailto:inquiry@heartmath.com">inquiry@heartmath.com</a>. If you choose this option, please DO NOT include credit  card information, as e-mail is <u>absolutely not</u> a secure method of sending  private financial information over the Internet. Simply include your daytime  phone number in the e-mail, and we will call you for the necessary information.  You may also order by phone or fax during normal business hours at  1-800-450-9111. We're open from Mon - Fri 9 to 5:30 Pacific Time. Of course,  you may also print your completed order and mail it to us at: (each company insert  proper address).</p>
                        <p>If you have further questions, please call us toll-free at  1-800-450-9111 or e-mail us, including your name and mailing address, at <a href="mailto:inquiry@heartmath.com">inquiry@heartmath.com</a>. (each company  include appropriate information)</p>
                        <b>Notification and Changes</b>
                        <p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes  on this page so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use  it and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Users should check  this policy frequently to keep abreast of any changes. </p>
                        <p>For questions about this privacy statement, the practices of  this site or any dealings with HeartMath LLC, contact: (each company include  appropriate information).</p>
