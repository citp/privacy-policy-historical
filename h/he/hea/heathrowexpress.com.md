# Privacy Notice

Updated October 2012

##  How we use your information

Heathrow Express is committed to collecting and using your personal information responsibly, securely and fairly. This privacy notice tells you what to expect when Heathrow Express collects personal information via our websites. The information you provide through our website and which is held by Heathrow Express is used for the following purposes:

  * To book and make payments for tickets;
  * To provide you with updates, news and offers related to our products and services;
  * Obtain feedback from our customers;
  * Job applications;
  * To create a user, business or corporate account.



In order to fulfil these purposes we may need to disclose your information to other organisations which we use to deliver services to you. Where your information is provided to third parties they will only use your information for those purposes and in some instances this may require your information to be transferred overseas but we will make sure your information remains protected and secure. In the case of all disclosures we will always ensure the disclosure is legitimate and proportionate for the purpose.

We will keep your personal information in line with our retention policy which ensures that we keep your details for no longer than is necessary. Your information will be retained in a secure environment and access to it will be restricted according to the ‘need to know’ principle.

When you purchase certain products and services from Heathrow Express we may send you confirmation emails; these may also include marketing which may be of interest to you. We do our best to tailor this information so that it is useful to you, but if at any time you no longer wish to receive it, you can opt out by following the instructions that we will give you with each communication.

## Access to personal information

Individuals can find out if we hold any personal information by making a ‘subject access request’ under the Data Protection Act 1998. If we do hold information about you we will:

  * give you a description of it;
  * tell you why we were holding it;
  * tell you who it could be disclosed to;
  * let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form.



To make a request to Heathrow Express for any personal information we may hold you need to put a request in writing using the contact details at the end of this notice.

If we do hold information about you, you can ask us to correct any mistakes by contacting us using the contact details provided.

## Complaints and Queries

Heathrow Express tries to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information. For this reason we take any complaints we receive about this seriously. We encourage people to bring it to our attention if they think our collection or use of personal information is unfair, misleading or inappropriate.

## Disclosure of personal information

In the majority of cases we will not disclose your personal information to others unless we have previously gained your consent. However there will be circumstances where we may disclose your personal information without your consent e.g. where we are required by law to disclose information or where the information is required to prevent or detect a crime. In the case of all disclosures we will always ensure the disclosure is legitimate and proportionate for the purpose.
