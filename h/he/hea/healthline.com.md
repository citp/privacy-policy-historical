## Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Healthline and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Websites. Additionally, some Internet browsers have a "do not track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Currently, we do not respond to 'do not track' signals because we are trying to provide you with a personalized experience.

We use session Cookies that expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) and persistent Cookies which remain on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire. How long a persistent Cookie remains on your browser depends on how long the visited website has programmed the Cookie to last or they can be stored for longer.

We use Cookies for different purposes, including tracking your consent for various services, personalizing content, and targeting advertisements.

To the extent permitted by applicable law and with your consent, we may permit third parties to collect user Personal Information over time or across third-party websites, and we may permit third parties to gather Personal Information passively on our Websites for behavioral advertising purposes, examples include:

**Re-targeting** : in order to provide you with a more customized web experience and to present you with information that may be of interest to you, our advertising partners may seek to use their observed behavior on the Websites to deliver targeted ads when you are on other websites.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Apps on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the Apps.

We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. The Apps may also ask for your permission to access your camera and your photos. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, or if you've initially agreed for the application to access your camera and photos and you would like to stop the app from accessing them, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.

We collect location information only in our Apps (zip code and state of residence) and we collect it for the purpose of matching our users based on their location. If you do not wish to allow us to share zip code and state of residence information in this manner within our Apps, please opt-out by completing our rights request form or email [privacypractices@healthline.com](mailto:privacypractices@healthline.com) instructing us to no longer share this information within our Apps.
