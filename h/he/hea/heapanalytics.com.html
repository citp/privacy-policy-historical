      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>Heap, Inc. (“Heap,” “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Heap collects, uses, and shares the personal information we collect from visitors to our website (“Website”). For information about how we collect and use information collected from our customers (“Customer Data”) during the provision of our service (“Service”), please see “Customer Data,” below. By accessing or using our Service, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
      <p>We collect personal information about you from various sources to provide our services to you, to analyze and improve our services, and to communicate with you. To help you understand how we use and share this information, this Privacy Policy describes our data privacy and confidentiality practices.</p>
      <p>Capitalized terms that are not defined herein have the meanings given them in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
      <h4>1. How We Collect and Use Information</h4>
      <p>We collect personal information from our website visitors in order to provide you with a personalized, useful and efficient experience. The categories of information we collect can include: </p>
      <p>Information that you provide to us. We collect information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us. For example, we may request your personal information (e.g., name, postal address, email address, telephone number, credit/debit card number, security code) or your applicable business information when you register for an account or purchase our Service. We may also collect any communications that you exchange with us, as well as any information you provide if you take part in any interactive features of the Service.</p>
      <p>Information collected through technology. We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service. When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file information from your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics of our visitors. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the Service. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time.</p>
      <p>When you access our Service by or through a mobile device, we may receive or collect and store a unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (“IDFA”), Google Ad ID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.</p>
      <p>Information from other sources. We may obtain information from other sources, such as third-party information providers, or through mergers and acquisitions, and combine this with information previously collected. In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of the combined personal information.</p>
      <p>We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you. We may also send you Service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, billing confirmation, changes or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Similarly, if you request information from us through an online contact form or if you email us, we collect the information you provide (e.g., name, telephone number, email address) so that we can respond to you. For more information about your communication preferences, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” below.</p>
      <h4>2. How We Share Personal Information</h4>
      <p>We may share your personal information in the instances described below. For further information on your choices regarding your information, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information.”</p>

        <li>We may aggregate, or strip information of personally identifying characteristics, and then share that aggregated or anonymized information with third parties.</li>
        <li>We may share or disclose your personal information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that we are required to do so under applicable law or regulatory requirements, or if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with preventing fraud or illegal activity, and/or to enforce our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
        <li>We may share your personal information with corporate subsidiaries we own or control and which are governed by this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to transfer any information we collect in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including any shares in the company) or any portion or combination of our products, services, businesses and/or assets. Should such a transaction occur (whether a divestiture, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, liquidation, or similar transaction or proceeding), we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that any transferred information is treated in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>3. Customer Data</h4>

Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. (To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies, you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org). If you access our service on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings. </p>
      <h4>5. Data Protection and Security</h4>
      <p>Storage and Transfer: Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Heap or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which we or our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
      <p>Keeping Information Safe: Heap cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, technical and organizational measures designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
      <p>Heap’s obligations with respect Customer Data are defined in our agreements with our customers and are not included in this Privacy Policy. Each customer will remain responsible for the privacy and security of the Customer Data that it collects and processes and for compliance with applicable data protection laws that may apply to the collection, processing and disclosure of Customer Data.</p>
      <h4>6. Links to Third-Party Websites and Services</h4>
      <p>For your convenience, our website and Services may provide links to third-party websites or services that are not governed by this Privacy Policy. To the extent that any linked third-party websites or services you visit are not owned or controlled by Heap, we are not responsible for those websites’ or services’ content or information practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site or service before providing any personal information.</p>
