In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you purchase a gift card for someone and request that we deliver it electronically, decide to purchase and ship products to someone, or create and share a gift registry. We will use this information to fulfill your requests and will not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your requests, unless they separately consent to receive communications from us. 

**Information We Collect Automatically.** We may also automatically collect information about you when you access or use the Services or transact business with us, including:

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you can usually change your browser settings to remove or reject cookies. 

  
**Information We Collect from Other** Sources. We may also receive information about you from other sources and combine or link that with information we have about you.

  * investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities;
  * respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service;

  * between and among Healthy Feet Store and any current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership; and
  * with your consent.

  
We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. **Security**

We also use a third party to "power" product reviews and product questions and answers on our Services. When you submit a product review, you may become subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of this third party and the reviews you submit may be posted on our Services and on third-party sites.
