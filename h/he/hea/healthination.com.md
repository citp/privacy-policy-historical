As stated above, you may provide certain PII to HealthiNation in order to have access to certain features on the Website. Such PII shall include basic biographical and contact information, such as your name and email address. We may also ask you for general statistical, non-PII about yourself and your interests.

HealthiNation also may share your PII with third parties for direct marketing and other purposes, and you acknowledge that the handling of your PII by such third parties will not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you would rather us not share your PII with the any third party for direct marketing purposes, please either (1) do not submit PII to HealthiNation through the Website or (2) indicate your desire for us not to share your PII with third parties for direct marketing purposes by submitting such a request in writing (an “Opt-Out Request”) to us at: 440 Ninth Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10001 Attention: Tony Estrella, or by email at [ optout@healthination.com](mailto:optout@healthination.com).

  
Please note that it may take several weeks for us to comply with your Opt-Out Request, and until we are able to comply with such request we may continue to use your PII as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that after receiving your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name and other PII to help us ensure that we can honor such request, to communicate to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct marketing. 

Please note that if we receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PII with a third party for direct marketing purposes or having otherwise transferred or disposed of your PII, HealthiNation may not have the ability to control the use of such PII by any third party, and in such an event you agree that HealthiNation shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of such PII by any such third party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition. If you are concerned about HealthiNation sharing your PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing your PII, you should not provide your PII to HealthiNation.

**Under what other circumstances may we release PII?**

We may also release your PII if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), to apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property, to protect Website users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII. 

**What other information does HealthiNation collect?**
