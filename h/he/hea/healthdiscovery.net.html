	  Discussion Groups Policies</b></font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our Online 
	  Discussion Groups have a bulletin board format that allows our visitors 
	  the opportunity to interact with our online community. These areas are 
	  moderated by volunteer hosts strictly to keep inappropriate messages from 
	  being posted. You are offered the opportunity to include your email address 
	  with your message but you are not obligated to do so. If you do include 
	  your email address then it is visible to the general public on the bulletin 
	  board and we cannot control the actions of any third parties. We will 
	  not sell email addresses from our bulletin boards. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please keep 
	  in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online 
	  - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that 
	  information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post 
	  personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may 
	  receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, 
	  Health Discovery's partners and third-party Internet sites and services 
	  accessible through Health Discovery, have separate privacy and data collection 
	  practices, independent of us. Health Discovery has no responsibility or 
	  liability for these independent policies or actions. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You are solely 
	  responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account 
	  information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Newsletter </b> </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you decide 
	  to submit your email address to us in order to be added to our mailing 
	  list, you may be assured that you will not receive separate emails from 
	  other marketers as a result of joining our newsletter. You will receive 
	  no offers from our sites other than those made through the newsletter 
	  itself, which, of course, you have elected to receive. You may unsubscribe 
	  at any time through our unsubscribe page. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Surveys 
	  &amp; Contests</b> </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From time 
	  to time Health Discovery requests information from users via surveys or 
	  contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary 
	  and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
	  Some of the information requested is of a personal nature but there is 
	  certainly no obligation to answer every question. In particular, submission 
	  of your email address is entirely optional. Information requested may 
	  include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic 
	  information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be 
	  used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be 
	  used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction 
	  of this site. Large population demographics may be compiled and published 
	  using this data but no individual information is ever disseminated. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Links</b> </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This web 
	  site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Health Discovery 
	  is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage 
	  our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
	  statements of each and every web site that collect personally identifiable 
	  information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected

	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advertisements 
	  are the sole revenue source for Health Discovery and is used to support our free-of-charge community.  Health Discovery does not endorse any of the advertised products/services 
	  that we display. Health Discovery makes every effort to avoid 
	  advertisements that do not comply with the site editorial policy. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Security</b> </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have

	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our users 
	  are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information 
	  used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where 
	  we ask for the information. For example, our message board will have an 
	  "opt-out" mechanism so users can keep their e-mail address off 
	  our lists. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users who 
	  no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from 
	  our partners may opt-out of receiving this communications using our unscribe 
	  option. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users of 
	  our site are always notified when their information is being collected 
	  by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice 
	  as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside 
	  party, or not.<br>
	</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <b>Notification of Changes</b> </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we decide 
	  to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage 
	  so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
	  it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point 
	  we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different 
	  from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by 
	  way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use 
	  their information in this different manner. We will use information in 
	  accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 
	  Protecting the privacy of our visitors is our topmost concern. </font></p>
