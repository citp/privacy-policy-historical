#### Website and Credit Card Security

####   

####  

We take website and credit card security extremely seriously. HealthPost endeavour to provide a safe and secure platform on which to conduct online transactions. www.healthpost.co.nz uses the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts your information as it is transmitted over the internet. This encryption scrambles details such as credit card number, billing details and delivery address so that generally, other computers are unable to decipher the information, ensuring privacy and security. To make sure you are accessing a secure server, check for the unbroken key or closed lock symbol located generally either at the bottom left, bottom right or top right of your browser window. If this appears, then SSL is active. You can double check this by looking at the URL as well. If SSL is active, then the first characters of that line will read ‘https’ rather than just ‘http’. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Ensure you logout when you have finished visiting www.healthpost.co.nz especially if you access our website from a shared computer.

#### Linking to Third-Party Websites

   
When you click on links and banners on our site that take you to third party web sites, you will be subject to the third party's privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, HealthPost Ltd cannot be responsible for the actions of any third-party web sites.  

####   

#### Changes to our Privacy Policy

####  

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time by publishing the revised privacy policy on our website. We encourage you to check this policy regularly for any modifications or updates. Your continued use of our Services after any changes have been posted on our Website indicates your acceptance of those changes.

If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy or any other matter, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/default.aspx?action=forms&cf_name=CONTACT&infoid=5).
