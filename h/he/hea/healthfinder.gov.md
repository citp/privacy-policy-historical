When you browse through any website, some information about you can be collected. Our Web server software automatically collects and temporarily stores the following information about each visit: 

  * the name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are using an America Online account, or stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's domain ? we do not collect your full email address); 
  * the date and time of the visit; 
  * the pages visited; and
  * the address of the website you came from when you came to visit.



We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. No other information will be collected without your knowledge. 

## Disclosure

## Intrusion Detection

This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in federal court. 

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.
