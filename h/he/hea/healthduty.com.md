**How We Use Cookies**

We send “cookies” to your computer and use other technologies to enhance your online experience. A “cookie” can be either permanent (i.e., it remains on your computer until you delete it) or temporary (i.e., it lasts only until you close your browser). A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor’s ongoing access to and use of the site, and track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that can lead to website improvements. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can deny or accept the cookie feature using a simple procedure available in most browsers. If you block cookies, however, you may lose some website functionality.

**Is My Credit Card Information Secure?**

We use a variety of safeguards to protect the security of your credit card transactions. We use technologies and processes such as encryption, access controls, network firewalls, physical security and other measures. These measures make it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept the credit card information you send to us. When we work with other companies to process credit card transactions, those companies also use encryption and other security measures.  
You can make financial contributions online, by mail, by calling , or by contacting your local Red Cross chapter .

**Is My Personal Information Secure?**

We use the same security measures and industry-standard security protocols for online scheduling of blood donations as we do for credit card transactions.   
You can also schedule a blood donation by calling 1-800-GIVE-LIFE or contacting your local Red Cross Blood Services Region.

**How We Use Your Information**

The American Red Cross will not sell, trade, or share personal information about our financial donors with anyone else, nor will we send mailings to our financial donors on behalf of other organizations, unless a donor has given us specific permission to do so.

If you provide the Red Cross with personal information when you visit our website, we may use the information in our programs and activities. We may enter your name into one of our databases so we can contact you to obtain your input, provide information about our programs and events, or request contributions.

On occasion, the Red Cross may share information about you with vendors and service providers that assist us with our activities and programs. These vendors and service providers help us with functions such as fulfilling orders, managing data and processing donations. In addition, we make disclosures as required by law.

**We Care About Doing it Right**

The American Red Cross is committed to accuracy and precision in processing your contribution information. We employ a variety of error-checking procedures, and our systems are subject to independent external and internal audits to ensure the privacy, security and accurate processing of your information.

**Note to Parents on Our Privacy Policy**

The American Red Cross welcomes children to learn more about our organization and, where appropriate, find opportunities to serve their communities through Red Cross training programs and volunteer activities. However, we encourage children to do this only with their parents’ knowledge and supervision. For this reason, the Red Cross follows the guidelines for interactive electronic media published by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau.
