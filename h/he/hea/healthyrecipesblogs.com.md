We may use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the website. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.

The use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and we disclaim all liability in connection therewith.

### 8\. AdThrive Advertising

This Site is affiliated with AdThrive, LLC (“AdThrive”) for the purposes of placing advertising on the Site. AdThrive has provided us with the following information:

AdThrive uses standard and widely-available tools for the placement and serving of ads, including those provided by Google, Inc. and its affiliates. We publish interest-based advertisements on the Site; that is, ads that are tailored to reflect your interests. To help understand your interests, AdThrive, Google and our other advertising partners will track your behavior on our Website and on other websites across the Internet using cookies.

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

By using this Site, you consent to the use of such cookies and the sharing of data captured by such cookies with AdThrive, Google, and our other third-party partners. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser by visiting: [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/). You can also opt out of the network cookie using those settings or using the Network Advertising Initiative’s multi-cookie opt-out mechanism at: [http://optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/). However, these opt-out mechanisms themselves use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained.

For European Economic Area Residents: If you reside in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), then under the GDPR and applicable data protection laws you have the rights, among other things, to access your personal data, have us erase it, and/or restrict its further processing. If you wish to access or delete your personal data (if any) maintained by us or AdThrive related to advertising on the Site, you can contact AdThrive at info@adthrive.com.

An IP or Internet Protocol Address is a unique numerical address assigned to a computer as it logs on to the internet. VDL, Inc. does not have access to any personally identifiable information and we would never seek this information. Your IP address is logged when visiting our site, but our analytic software only uses this information to track how many visitors we have from particular regions, and Recipe Maker as detailed above uses it to prevent rating spam.

### 10\. Sucuri

## Who we may share your information with

## How will we use your information and why?

At VDL, Inc. we take your privacy seriously and will only use your personal information to provide the Services you have requested from us. We will only use this information subject to your instructions, data protection law and our duty of confidentiality.

Our lawful reason for processing your personal information is “A legitimate interest” eg to respond to your request to receive emails from us. We collect information on our website to process your inquiry and send you emails and newsletters. **We do not sell personal information and will not share your information for marketing purposes with other companies** so that they may offer you their own products and services.

We may use the information collected in the following ways:

  1. To operate and maintain the Website;
  2. To send you promotional information, such as newsletters. Each email promotion will provide information on how to opt-out of future mailings;
  3. To send you administrative communications, such as administrative emails, confirmation emails, technical notices, updates on policies, or security alerts;
  4. To respond to your inquiries;
  5. To track and measure analytics and advertising on the Website;
  6. To protect, investigate, and deter against unauthorized or illegal activity.



Except when required by law, **we will not sell, distribute, or reveal your email addresses or other personal information without your consent** ; however, we may disclose or transfer personal information collected through the Website to third parties who acquire all or a portion of our business, which may be the result of a merger, consolidation, or purchase of all or a portion of our assets.

From time to time, we may use anonymous data, which does not identify you, or data combined with data from other parties. This type of anonymous data may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Examples of this anonymous data may include analytics or information collected from cookies.

You may subscribe to our newsletter, which may be used for advertising purposes. All newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels. The pixel is embedded in emails and allows an analysis of the success of online marketing campaigns. Because of these tracking pixels, we may see if and when you open an email and which links within the email you click. Also, this allows the Website to adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the user.

## Transferring your information outside of Europe

As part of the services offered to you through this website, the information which you give to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Union (“EU”). We and some of our third-party providers are located outside of the EU. Specifically, this Website is hosted in the United States.

By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If you use our services while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU to give you those services.

## Security precautions in place about data collected

When you give us personal information, we take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely. Our Website is encrypted and protected with the following software: DV SSLs from Let’s Encrypt. When you are on a secure page, a lock icon will typically appear on web browsers.

Non-sensitive details such as your email address are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

## Marketing

If you have consented to receive marketing by subscribing to our blog, we will send you information about new blog posts, or other emails and newsletters which may be of interest to you. You may opt out at any point as set out below. You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes. To opt out please email: HealthyRecipesBlog@gmail.com, or use the “Unsubscribe” link on any email you receive from us.

## How long will we hold your data for?

GDPR requires us to retain personal data no longer than is necessary for the purpose we obtained it for.

We will hold your personal data that you voluntarily gave to us, eg name and email for marketing purposes, for as long as you wish to continue receiving emails from us. With each email you receive from us, you will have the opportunity to opt out by unsubscribing.

As for information collected by Google Analytics, we have set our user data retention period to the shortest offered, which is 14 months.

## Access to your personal information and the right to be forgotten

The right to remove information does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## Links to other websites

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website.

You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
