When you visit the HearthSong Online Store, our server automatically recognizes the address of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and, in some cases, your domain name. We cannot identify you individually from your screen name if you are using America Online or one of the other major online services. Our server also identifies your browser, your browser version, the operating system you are using, the pages you visit in the HearthSong Online Store and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of where you were on the Internet if you clicked a link to www.hearthsong.com. 

We intend to continue improving the content and function of the HearthSong Online Store. For this reason, we gather the information mentioned above so that we can provide content of interest to you and a site that functions correctly on your computer system. 

If you place an order or request a catalog from us online, and do not indicate otherwise, we will add your e-mail address to the list of people who receive e-mail notification of special offers and other communications from us from time to time. We will also keep your e-mail address on file so we can contact you about your order. If you send e-mail to us, we will ask you, in our reply, if you would like to be added to our e-mail address list. You will not be added to our e-mail address list without your permission. We may, in the future, share your e-mail address with other businesses or organizations that have products or services we feel may be of interest to you. 

If you should change your mind and decide that you do not wish to receive e-mail from us or do not wish us to share your e-mail address with others, you may let us know by e-mail, send us a letter or give us a call. 

If you give us your telephone number online, we may call you about your order. If you would rather we not call you and communicate by e-mail only, please let us know by [E-Mail](https://web.archive.org/web/19990505181612id_/http%3A//www.hearthsong.com/service/comments.cfm), send us a letter or give us a call.

Other information that may be requested of you includes: your name, address, city, state, zip code, the name(s) and full address(es) of your recipients and their phone number, also at times a gift message and your requested delivery date. Also, we collect your comments so we can better serve you in the future. Of course for orders, your items, the quantity of each item and bank card number with its expiration date is collected. 

We are committed to data security and the accuracy of our information (see Our [Security Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/19990505181612id_/http%3A//www.hearthsong.com/service/security.cfm)) received from domestic and foreign visitors to our site. Likewise, your recipient(s)' information is never shared with third parties. In addition, none of your information is merged with outside data for marketing purposes.

As noted earlier, your information is never shared with any third party when you let us know by [E-Mail](https://web.archive.org/web/19990505181612id_/http%3A//www.hearthsong.com/service/comments.cfm), letter, phone or the do not solicit option on each location where we are collecting information. The only exception in response to your specific request for merchandise or information. It should be noted that if you do allow us to share information, the other companies may be governed by different privacy policies. 

If you would like to receive a copy of your personal information on file at HearthSong, please [E-Mail](https://web.archive.org/web/19990505181612id_/http%3A//www.hearthsong.com/service/comments.cfm) us with the following information: E-mail address you use for correspondence with HearthSong, Last Name, Zip code and your Account/Order number if available.
