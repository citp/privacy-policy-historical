### Changes to Web Privacy Practices

We may update this Policy from time to time. Changes apply to the information collected from the date we post the revision, as well as to information we already hold. We encourage you to visit and review this page frequently so you are aware of any changes since your last visit to the web site.

### HEALTH INFORMATION

“Health Information” is information that identifies you as a current or former HealthPartners health plan member or a current or former HealthPartners patient that relates to your health or condition, your health care services, payment, or coverage for those services.

If you are a HealthPartners health plan member, please consult the [Health Plan Notice of Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/ucm/groups/public/@hp/@public/documents/documents/cntrb_009405.pdf) for a description of our privacy practices and your rights as a health plan member. If your employer is self-insured, please check with your employer for more information about your employer’s health plan’s privacy practices.

If you are a HealthPartners or affiliated clinic or hospital patient, please consult the [Notice of Privacy Practices for Clinics, Hospitals and Other Care Providers Affiliated with the HealthPartners and Park Nicollet Family of Care](https://web.archive.org/ucm/groups/public/@hp/@public/documents/documents/cntrb_042452.pdf) for a description of our privacy practices and your rights as a patient.

### Your Personal Information

“Personal information” refers to specific facts that can be used to identify or contact you as an individual. Personal Information includes, for example, your name, home address and phone number, birth date, your sex, email address or other information that is unique to you.

“Personal Information” does _not_ include information that identifies a computer used to access this site. (See the section below about “Cookies and other information about your visit.”)

We collect your Personal Information through this website only if you provide it to us.

### Security of Health Information and Personal Information

We maintain a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect your Health Information and Personal Information and prevent unauthorized access when the information is in our control. However, you should remember that no system can perfectly prevent an unauthorized person from intentionally viewing information while it is in transit over the Internet or via email. Therefore, HealthPartners cannot and does not guarantee the confidentiality or security of information you send to us via the Internet or by email.

  3. We may use Personal Information to the extent necessary to protect our web site, our rights, and to avoid or minimize our liability.

### Cookies and other information about your visit

We collect information about visitors to our site using “cookies.” and similar technologies. A cookie is a small text file that is created when someone uses a browser to visit a web site. Cookies are stored on the computer’s browser directory or program data subfolder. A cookie is not “Personal Information” because, while it may identify the computer that is being used to visit the site, it does not identify who the visitor is.

Most major web sites, including this one, use cookies to help visitors navigate the site more successfully and to provide information about visitors’ behavior that help us improve the site and our marketing programs and to customize the online experience to the user’s needs. We may also use this information to tailor advertisements and offers to you, both on our websites and on other websites.

If you do not want to have cookies placed on your computer, you can set your web browser to not accept them, or you can delete them manually. You should remember, however, that disabling cookies may limit your ability to use some features of this website.

We may use analytics and advertising features provided by Google, including Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. If you would like more information about these practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by ad servers like Google, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Some ad servers allow you to opt out of anonymous data collection through the use of cookies. To do so, you must opt out of such data collection with each individual site. You can opt out of cookies for several ad servers by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) gateway opt-out site. At that site you can also review the privacy policies of those ad servers.

Note that we do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” or “DNT” signals that you can set through your browser settings. These signals are intended to give website visitors the opportunity to opt out of our collecting of information about the visitors’ online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. However, because there is currently no common definition of what such signals are and no industry-accepted standards for how such signals should be interpreted; we do not promise to abide by DNT signals.

Our web server also automatically collects the IP (for “Internet Protocol”) address of each computer that accesses our site. An IP address is a series of numerals that is assigned to each computer that accesses the Internet. An IP address is not Personal Information because it identifies only the computer, not the person who is using it. We use IP addresses in aggregate form to help us conduct analytics to understand how our site is being used and how we can better serve visitors.

### External Links

This Web Site Privacy Policy applies only to this web site and not to any third-party site we may link to. HealthPartners isn’t responsible for and has no control over the privacy policies and practices of third party sites that we link to and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that requests Personal Information from you before you provide any information.
