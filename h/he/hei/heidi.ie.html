      <b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
      Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to 
      combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level 
      of integrity in dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy is 
      designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard 
      the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making 
      informed decisions when using our site and our products and services. This 
      statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business 
      practices and our customers' needs.
      <p>

      <b>What Information Do We Collect?<br>
      <br>
      </b>When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of 
      information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is 
      collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on 
      an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.<br>
      <b><br>
      1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide<br>
      <br>
      </b>If you choose to purchase products or services from us or our 
      partners, you may need to give personal information and authorization to 
      obtain information from various credit services. For example, you may need 
      to provide the following information:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mailing address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Credit card number<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home and business phone number<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other personal information (i.e. mothers maiden name)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email Information<br>
      <br>
      In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you 
      choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the 
      content of your email messages together with your email address and our 
      responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic 
      communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received 
      by mail and telephone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Web Site Use Information<br>
      <br>
      </b>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a 
      standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect 
      information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through 
      cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the 
      pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just 
      before and just after our Web site. This information is collected on an 
      aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an 
      individual.
      </p><p>
      <b>Cookies <br>
      <br>
      What Are 
      Cookies?
      </b>Cookies are a 
      feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the 
      computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that 
      are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can 
      remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify 
      subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the 
      information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. 
      This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to 
      complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make 
      your online experience easier and more personalized.
      Certain parts of our sites e.g. the forum send a "cookie" 
      to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a 
      unique user. These are used to remember your forum login or preferences, 
      beyond enhancing the use of our sites we do not use the information for 
      any personal data gathering exercise.<br>
      Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You 
      can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie 
      is being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of our sites may not function properly if you refuse cookies.
      </p><p>
      <b>How Do We Use 
      Information We Collect from Cookies?</b>
      We use Web site 
      browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather 
      information about our Web site users’ browsing activities, in order to 
      constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. This 
      information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most 
      user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web site to better 
      meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.
      Cookies help us 
      collect important business and technical statistics. The information in 
      the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site as 
      they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how 
      many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site’s visitor 
      capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual 
      email address or any personally identifying information about you.
      </p><p>
      <b>Web Logs<br>
      </b>Web logs are used to gather general statistical information and identify 
      and track hackers.
      </p><p>
      <b>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? <br>
      </b>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of 
      administering our business activities, providing customer service and 
      making available other products and services to our customers and 
      prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we 
      collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new 
      services and special offers we think you will find valuable. <br>
      <b><br>
      Sharing Information with Affiliates</b><br>
      From time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised 
      on our Web site. We take measures to select product or service providers 
      that are responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. 
      However, we cannot make any representations about the practices and 
      policies of these companies.
      </p><p>
      <b>Sharing 
      Information with Strategic Partners</b><br>
      We may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third 
      parties however no personal information will be shared without your prior 
      agreement.<br>
      In connection with strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will 
      retain all ownership rights to the information.
      </p><p>
      <b>Notice of New Services and Changes <br>
      </b>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you 
      about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers 
      we think you will find valuable. As our client, you will be given the 
      opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by 
      clicking on a response box when you receive such an offer or by sending us 
      an email request at <script>mailaddr("admin","heidi.ie");</script><a href="mailto:admin@heidi.ie">admin@heidi.ie</a>.<br>
      <b><br>
      Links to Other 
      Sites <br>
      </b>Any site outside of ours we have no control over. Please be aware of 
      this when clicking on links in the newsletter or any forum.
      </p><p>
      <b>How Do We 
      Secure Information Transmissions?</b>
      When you send 
      confidential personal credit card information to us on our Web site, a 
      secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is 
      sent to us.
      The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our Web 
      site. Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we 
      advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your 
      transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send 
      confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us 
      through an unsecured email.
      </p><p>
      <b>How Do We Protect 
      Your Information?</b>
      </p><p>
      <b>Information 
      Security</b>.&nbsp; <br>
      We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality 
      of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure 
      and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.
      </p><p>
      <b>Evaluation of 
      Information Protection Practices. <br>
      </b>Periodically, our operations 
      and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies 
      and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our 
      information.
      </p><p>
      <b>Employee Access, 
      Training and Expectations. <br>
      </b>Our corporate values, ethical 
      standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of 
      customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee 
      access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of 
      such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.
      </p><p>
      <b>How Can You 
      Access and Correct Your Information?</b><br>
      You may request access to all your personally identifiable information 
      that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing&nbsp;
      <script>mailaddr("admin","heidi.ie");</script><a href="mailto:admin@heidi.ie">admin@heidi.ie</a>.
      <b>
      &nbsp;</b></p><p>
      <b>
      Do 
      We Disclose Information to Outside Parties?</b><br>

      traffic patterns and related Web site information to our affiliates or
