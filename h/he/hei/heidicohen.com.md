# Privacy Policy - Heidi Cohen

### Your Information

The Actionable Marketing Guide respects your privacy. Your email address, name and any other information you provide to the Actionable Marketing Guide are held in strict confidence. We only keep your information so that we can send you email keeping you informed on subjects that may interest you.

**We will not sell or share your information with anyone else.**

We will retain your personal data for as long as needed in order to provide services to you. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, such as your name and email address, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can [contact us](https://heidicohen.com/contact/).

### Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings or similar legal process, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
