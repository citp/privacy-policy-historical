Your privacy is important to us. At **** The Hershey Company, we value our consumer's privacy and have made it our policy to provide on-line content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. Furthermore, to better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our on-line information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

We take seriously our responsibility to our many young consumers.

Business Partners

We have some business partners with whom we may operate some of our pages and share information. For example, on occasion we may offer a sweepstakes jointly with another company. In such instances, information may be shared with the co-sponsor so that the sweepstakes may be conducted. Another situation in which information may be shared is when we have licensed our trademarks to another company to manufacture or distribute a particular product. 

Aggregate Information

Aggregate information about which pages visitors access or visit (for example, to enter a visitor in a contest or to send the visitor information) is only used for internal review as we continue to improve our web site. __ Non-personally identifiable aggregate information is shared with third parties. If you prefer not to allow us to collect this information, you can do so by turning off the cookies in your browser, although some areas of our websites may not function properly if you do, including: Hershey's Gifts checkout, auto login, and membership. __ We do not rent, sell, or share e-mail addresses with any other company or organization.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us on-line in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on-line.

A Word To Parents About Kids’ Privacy

Our Privacy Policy applies to children as well as adults. There are some extra precautions that we take, however, with respect to collecting information from children under 13.

  * All promotion entrants will be requested to provide their age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 on-line without first obtaining permission from the child’s parent or guardian. When a child under 13 years old attempts to register for a promotion or sweepstakes, we send their parent or guardian an e-mail to get their permission to collect the child’s personally identifiable information as part of their registration. If we do not receive permission within 14 days, we will delete the child’s request and they will not be able to complete their registration or enter any promotions online. Once a parent or guardian gives their permission for their child to register, the parent will be asked to complete the child's mailing information on behalf of the child.  When complete, the child will be able to enter future registration-based sweepstakes or contests without any further requests of consent to the parent; however the parent will be notified when the child enters a promotion.  Should the child's personally identifiable information require updating, the parent will be required to make any and all updates to their child's online registration information on behalf of the child. If a child under 13 is a winner, we will contact you and/or your child by e-mail for prize fulfillment purposes.
  * We do not require a child to provide more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity. (You may wish to be aware that, according to the FTC, web site operators are not permitted to collect more information than is needed for a child to participate in an on-line activity.)
  * Our web sites do not offer activities that allow your child or Hershey to disclose your child’s personal information publicly (for example through chat rooms or message boards).
  * We do not share your child’s personally identifiable information with third parties.
  * If you would like to review personally identifiable information about your child that we have on file, or request that certain information be changed or deleted, please contact:
