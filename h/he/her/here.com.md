We will give you additional privacy information that is specific to a product or service in Supplements to this Policy and other notices you may see while using our products or services. If there is a difference between such notices and this Policy, the notices should be considered first.

Software on your device may access your information. Our products or services may contain links to, or may be embedded within, other companies’ websites and services that have privacy policies of their own. Where our products or services are embedded to products and services of our customers, we require our customers to provide necessary transparency to you. This might include linking to this Policy and the relevant Supplements, or providing the transparency in integrated and embedded notices which identify us as the service provider or controller.

**If you do not agree with this Policy, do not use our products and services or provide HERE with your personal data.**

**What information do we collect?**

We collect your personal data and other information when you make a purchase, use or register into our products and services (including navigation.com stores, which are branded by Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and operated by us), take part in campaigns or research or otherwise interact with us. This includes following categories:

**Product and service activations**

HERE products and services may require electronic activation, where your device and application type, as well as unique device, application, network and subscription identifiers are sent to HERE.

**Use of products and services**

When you access our services online, our web servers automatically create records of your visit. These records typically include IP-address, access times, the sites linked from, pages visited, the links and features used, the content viewed or requested, browser or application type, language and other such information. See also our [Cookie policy](https://legal.here.com/privacy/cookies).

Our applications may contact our servers periodically, for example to check for updates or to send us information relating to service usage. Additionally, we may invite you to join voluntary product and service improvement or research programs where detailed information is collected. See Supplements to this Policy for more details.

**Information you provide us with**

When you create an account, make a purchase, request services, participate in research or campaigns or otherwise interact with us, we may ask for information such as your name, email address, phone number, street address, user names and passwords, feedback, information relating to your devices, age, gender, and language, bank account number, credit card details and other such financial information.

**Your transactions with us**

We maintain records of your purchases, downloads, the content you have provided us with, your requests, agreements between you and HERE, the products and services provided to you, payment and delivery details, your contacts and communications and other interactions with us.

**Positioning and Location data**

Location-based services establish location through the use of satellite, mobile, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) or other network based positioning methods. These technologies may involve exchanging your location data and unique device and mobile, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other network related identifiers with HERE. Our products may operate on multiple device platforms, applications and services which may also collect your location data.

**Information provided by partners**

We obtain information from industry partners and a variety of other sources, including publicly available sources such as business registries.

**Why do we process Personal Data?**

HERE may process your personal data for the following purposes. One or more purposes may apply simultaneously.

We may use your personal data to provide you with our products and services, to process your requests or as otherwise may be necessary to perform the contract between you and HERE, to ensure the functionality and security of our products and services, to identify you as well as to prevent and investigate fraud and other misuses.

**Accounts**

Some services may require an account to help you manage your content and preferences. Depending on the service, an account creation may be either required or voluntary. Account creation requires you to provide us with basic contact details about yourself, such as name, email address, country of residence and date of birth. You may also be able to voluntarily provide more information about yourself while creating a profile, such as a photo or avatar of your choice.

**Developing and managing products and services**

This may include displaying HERE and third party content.

**What is our legal basis for processing your Personal Data?**

Our legal basis for processing your personal data is dependent on the purpose for processing and may vary as described in the Supplement applicable to the product or service you are using. In general, we process your personal data under the following legal bases:

**Performance of a contract with you**

**Your consent**

We process your personal data if you have consented to the processing activity. You may revoke your consent at any time. Doing so will bar us from further processing of your personal data based on your consent, but will not impact the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before it was withdrawn. Some of the features of our products and services might be only available based on consent.

**Legal obligations**

We process your personal data as needed to comply with laws and regulations.

**Legitimate interests**

We process your personal data to further our legitimate interests, such as in connection with managing, developing, testing, securing, and in limited circumstances marketing, advertising, and making recommendations regarding our products and services.

Further information or specification of our legitimate interests may be provided in relevant Supplements applicable to the product or service.

  **How long do we retain Personal Data?**

We endeavor to only collect personal data that are necessary for the purposes for which they are collected, and to retain such data for no longer than is necessary for such purposes. The length of time personal data is retained, and criteria for determining that time, are dependent on the nature of the personal data and the purpose for which it was provided. For example, for your personal data related to managing your account (such as name, email address, and account content and preferences) are maintained for as long as they are retained by you within your account. Other data, such as records of your activity within the application, are typically maintained only for a short period before being anonymized or pseudonymized.

Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal data or other information that might be accessible to other users.

**HERE companies and authorized third parties**

We may share your personal data with other HERE companies or authorized third parties who process personal data for HERE for the purposes described in this Policy. This may include for example billing through your network service provider or otherwise, delivery of your purchases, providing services including customer service, managing and analyzing consumer data, credit checks, conducting research and managing marketing and other such campaigns.
