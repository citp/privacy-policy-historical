# Herrschners Online

**The Information We Collect**  
At some Herrschners Inc. web sites, including herrschners.com, bidcrafts.com, needleworkshoppe.com, and yarnshoppe.com, you can order products, enter contests, or subscribe to one of our services such as our online promotional emails. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

**How We Use the Information**  
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as for customer service questions or when we fulfill a request by you for online promotional emails.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

Agents and contractors of Herrschners Inc. who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Herrschners Inc.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

Herrschners Inc. may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, please send an e-mail, along with your first and last name, to [customerservice@herrschners.com](mailto:customerservice@herrschners.com).

When you order products from us or request a catalog, we place you in our customer file. This file is occasionally made available to carefully screened companies and organizations whose products and services might be of interest to you, but we never share your email address or telephone number, as noted below. If you do not wish to receive our printed catalog or do not want your name made available to other companies, please email your name and address to our [customerservice@herrschners.com](mailto:customerservice@herrschners.com) department.

Finally, Herrschners Inc. sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Advertisers and Sponsors**  


Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

**"Cookies"**  
To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our web pages use "cookies". Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Your credit card number is never stored within these files.

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. Herrschners requires the use of cookies to complete and process your order. If you choose not to accept cookies, you can still [order from Herrschners via phone, mail or fax](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207093907id_/http%3A//www.herrschners.com/cs_order.asp).

**Email Addresses and Telephone Numbers**  
Herrschners does not share any email addresses you provide to any other companies or organizations. If you choose to receive our promotional emails, they will arrive bi-monthly, but we always extend you the option to 'opt-out' from future mailings.

Any telephone numbers you provide will be used only for customer service questions, such as incorrectly entered credit card information. This number is not shared with any other companies.
