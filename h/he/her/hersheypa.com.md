# Hershey Entertainment & Resorts Company Privacy Policy

**HERSHEY ENTERTAINMENT & RESORTS COMPANY**

* * *

**PRIVACY POLICY** **  
OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY**  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our home page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to the following Hershey Entertainment & Resorts Company ("HE&R") Websites, but to make this notice easier to read we will refer here only to "our Website", meaning either _HersheyPA.com, Hersheypark.com, ZooAmerica.com, TheHotelHershey.com, HersheyLodge.com, SpaAtHotelHershey.com, HersheyMeetings.com, GolfHershey.com, DiningInHershey.com, HersheyCamping.com, HersheyNursery.com, HauntedHarvest.com, ChristmasInHershey.com, TourHershey.com, HersheyJobs.com, HersheyBears.com, HersheyparkStadium.com, or GiantCenter.net._ Other Hershey Entertainment & Resorts Company Websites may operate under their own privacy notices.

Our Website contains links to other Websites operated by third parties. HE&R is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third party Websites.

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**  
Our Website is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor to our Website. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not email addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our Website. This information is used only for internal purposes by our technical support staff.

Our Website does track certain information about the visits to our Website. For example, we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web Site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Website and for product development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

In a few areas on our Website, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain information, materials and services available from our Website, or to enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise support your customer relationship with HE&R. It is completely optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials and services.

For example, we request information from you when you:

  1. Register or sign-up to use a service such as our email newsletters. 
  2. Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services. 
  3. Place an order. 
  4. Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer. 
  5. Provide feedback in an online survey.   




In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, email address, phone number, address, law practice information, product preference information, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.  


**HOW WE USE INFORMATION**  
HE&R only uses your personal information for specific purposes.

The personal information you provide to us when using our Website, such as your name, postal or email address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with HE&R, and to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from HE&R, or offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you. Agents or contractors of HE&R who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for HE&R.

HE&R may enhance or merge your information collected at its Website with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.

With respect to network advertising companies (companies that manage and provide advertising for numerous unrelated companies), to the extent that HE&R utilizes such advertising companies to provide advertisements on our Website, HE&R may provide them with your log-in name and any demographic information about you that we collect. Those advertising companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable data collected by the advertising company from your computer solely for the purpose of delivering on our Website advertisements that are targeted to you.

Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with HE&R, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.

**YOU CAN OPT OUT OF RECEIVING FURTHER MARKETING FROM HE &R AT ANY TIME**  
We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only HE&R (or agents or contractors working on behalf of HE&R and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily opt out of receiving further marketing from HE&R by emailing us at [Webmaster@HersheyPA.com](mailto:Webmaster@HersheyPA.com).

**OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION**  
You can request a copy of the personally-identifiable information that HE&R has collected about you via the Internet by contacting our Website Manager at the address below. You can also have factual inaccuracies in this information corrected by contacting this same person.
