**MACMILLAN COMMUNITY NETWORK**

**PRIVACY NOTICE**  
**Effective Date: February 13, 2011**

We at Macmillan respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship we have with you. This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect on the Macmillan Community Network sites, including this site (the “Site”), how we may use that information, and with whom we may share it. This Privacy Notice also describes the measures we take to protect your personal information. In addition, we describe the choices you can make about how we use the personal information you provide to us, how you can update your personal information, contact us with questions or comments, inquire about our company and its products and services, or ask any questions you may have about our privacy practices or this website. This Privacy Notice does not include information about collection and use practices on other Macmillan branded websites. Please see the privacy notices on those other sites for descriptions of their practices.

**_Information We Collect:_**

**Registration**  
You may register on our Site as a member of the site’s community. If you choose to register, we will collect your email address, password, and age. Community members also create a community user name. Community members may choose to provide other information in their profiles including, but not limited to, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, and groups with which they are affiliated. This information is provided at the registrant’s sole discretion with the understanding that this information will be publicly disclosed.

By registering for the site, you are automatically signed up for our newsletter, and you also get access to content that is behind the registration wall, can leave comments, and can enter site sweepstakes and other promotions. 

Registered members can change their personal information and can control how visitors and other members communicate with them by controlling their user profile privacy settings.  See “Your User Profile”, below.

On this site, we give you the option of registering through your existing account with certain other social network sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Yahoo.  In order for you to register though your account with one of these sites, you will be asked for your permission for the site to share with us certain of the personal information you provided in connection with your registration with that site.  

**Commenting**  
We give you the option of commenting on content on the site, even if you are not a registered user.  In this case, we will ask for your name and e-mail address.

**Surveys and Questionnaires**  
We may ask you to complete online surveys and opinion polls on a variety of topics, including activities, attitudes, and interests as they relate to our products and services. When you complete a survey we or our service provider usually collect your name, zip code, and email address. We also may ask you for additional information, such as your age, interests, or product preferences.

**Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions**  
From time to time we run sweepstakes, contests and other promotions. When you enter a promotion online, we may collect your first and last name, and email addresses. We also may ask you for additional information, such as your interests, product preferences and/or zip code. If you win a sweepstakes or contest, we may ask you for additional information in connection with prize fulfillment.

**User-Generated Content**  
We provide tools by which you may share publicly information about yourself and your interests, or content you have created (such as comments, photographs and video). If you choose to share such information and content we may ask for your name and e-mail address. All of this information may then be posted publicly.

**Blogs, Forums and Discussion Boards**  
Blogs, forums and discussion boards are free services to enable you to share comments about the books, articles and other content available on our site. These services connect you with other fans and registrants and allow you to share your questions, insights and views about products and information available through this site.

Please treat the other members of the Macmillan community with respect. Do not post profane, obscene, inflammatory or spiteful comments, or messages that abuse, denigrate or threaten others. We remind you that if you post your phone number, email address, or other personal contact information, it will become and remain publicly available.

Please keep in mind: A discussion board post is not an effective way to tell us you need help with an order or site feature. If you'd like to tell us about a specific problem, please email us at info(AT)heroesandheartbreakers.com

**Tell-a-Friend**  
We may offer “Tell a Friend” functionality on this Site to send your friends information from this site or other Macmillan Community Network sites. In order to fulfill this request, we will ask you for your and your friends’ names and email addresses. We do not retain your friend’s information after the email is sent.

**“Contact Us”**  
You may choose to contact us through our Site. If you email us comments or questions, we will have your email address, as well as any other information you choose to provide.

**Passive Collection of Information**  
When you visit our website, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using and your originating domain. We also collect certain information about our website visitors, such as how many users visited our site, the average time spent on the site, the pages viewed, and referring websites. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. While we generally examine such information only in the aggregate, such information could be linked back to individual IP addresses.

This Site’s HTML-formatted web pages may include electronic image requests (called a “single-pixel gif”, “clear-gifs” or “web beacon” request) which are sent to our service providers’ servers. These web beacons are the technique by which our service providers compile anonymous information about your browsing activity on the Site.

We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. On this site, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.

Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser, they go away. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they do not go away when you exit your browser.

We use cookies to administer certain functions, and to help you navigate the website more efficiently. For example, we use session cookies to enable you to comment and access certain content. Without the session cookie, you would have to log in again every time you wanted to perform one of these actions.

You can use our site without accepting cookies. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, if you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all features of this website.

Collection of site usage information on our site is performed on our behalf by  third party service providers. In addition to cookies, the service providers may use web beacons to notify the service provider of web page access by visitors. Our third party service provider may retain such usage information for its own internal purposes.

If your email software is capable of receiving HTML coded emails, when we send you emails our email service provider may collect information via web beacons regarding the delivery of the email, including, whether the email was delivered, whether it was opened, whether it was opened with HTML capable email software, when it was opened, IP address, domain name, browser type or operating system, links you click on and which web pages the you visit. This data may be associated with your email address by our service provider. Additionally, our emails may contain web beacons, which would perform similarly to the web beacons on the Site discussed above.

**_How We Use Information We Collect_**  
Personal information collected through or by this Site is used in connection with the purpose for which it was submitted, including: to contact you to answer a question, to send you a newsletter, RSS feed or other information you have requested, for the administration of any contests or sweepstakes, or to arrange for any other services you have requested.

If you register for this site through your existing account with another social network site, we will add the information provided by that site to your account profile, and may use such information for any purposes permitted by this privacy notice.  If you choose to share information (such as “likes”, comments and activities) with friends on these other sites through this website, we may also add this information to your account profile, and display the information on this site.

We may use the information we collect to enhance your experience while using our Site or viewing our electronic communications, to improve the content of the Site or to improve the quality or variety of the products, services and promotions we offer.

We may also use the information you provide to us to contact you regarding other promotions, offers, and information that may interest you.  See your options under “Your Choices”, below, if you do not wish to receive such information.

**_How We Share Personal Information_**  
We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to Macmillan through common ownership.

In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities with selected third parties and may share personal information about our website visitors with them.

We also share information provided by our website visitors with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may retain outside companies to manage databases of customer information and to distribute email offerings.

We also may transfer and disclose personal information in accordance with the terms and conditions of any sweepstakes and contests and any publicity release you may sign in connection with the promotion. Any information you provide in a user-generated content context may be publicly disclosed and shared accordingly.

In addition, we may disclose information about you to others (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud or illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information you have provided through this Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

**_Links to Other Web sites_**  
We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information, including Web sites of other companies related to Macmillan through common ownership. These sites may operate independently from this website, and may not be under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit them. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or the privacy practices of these sites.

To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads and provide other services on our web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, these ad servers and other entities may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and click-stream information. We are not responsible for the data collection practices of any sites linked from this site nor does our linking to third party websites or other services constitute sponsorship or endorsement of the content or business practices on these sites. By use of this site, you agree that use of the hyperlinks to third party sites will be at your own risk.

**_Children’s Privacy_**  
We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. We use technical measures to prevent collection of information from children under 13.

If our policy concerning collection of information from children under 13 changes, we will revise this portion of our privacy notice and will comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

**_Security_**  
Macmillan is committed to protecting the security of information collected on our site. We use technical, physical and administrative methods to safeguard and secure the information we collect on line.

Please remember that no data transmission over the Internet, or by other means, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect the information you provide through this website, Macmillan cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us. Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you transmit information over the Internet to this site at your own risk.

**_Your Choices_**  
We give you the option of requesting that we not share personal information about you with third parties that are unrelated by common ownership with Macmillan for marketing use. [Click here](mailto:internetmarketing@macmillanusa.com) This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it to send us an email with your name and email address(es) if you DO NOT want us to share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing use.

We also give you the option of requesting that we not share your information with companies related to Macmillan by common ownership for marketing use. However, PLEASE NOTE that, because of the integrated nature of Macmillan and some of these companies, if you opt out of sharing with them, you will also automatically be opted out of marketing use by us. That means that you will not receive marketing information from us about books, promotions and services. [Click here](mailto:internetmarketing@macmillanusa.com) This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it to send us an email with your name and email address(es), if you do not want us to share your information with related companies for marketing use (or use the information for marketing purposes ourselves). (Keep in mind, however, that some of our related companies may have independently obtained your information, in which case you may continue to receive communications from those companies, unless you opt out directly with them.)

Please be aware that we are able to effectuate an opt-out only for a specific email address. So, if you have more than one email address or if you have changed your email address, your opt-out request may not be effectuated properly. If you believe you have opted out, but continue to receive emails from us, please contact us by one of the means listed under “How to Contact Us”, below, and we will endeavor to resolve the issue.

You can “opt-out” of receiving newsletters, advertising and promotional email from us by following the opt-out instructions in our email messages. To ensure that your opt-out request is honored, you must use the designated method in the email message to notify us of your opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely.

Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving marketing information from us, we will continue to send you important service related communications, including follow-up messages regarding sweepstakes or contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken (e.g., order confirmation).

If you cannot determine how to opt-out of a particular program, please contact us as specified in the “Contact Us’ section below.
