Heroes Fanatic believes very strongly in keeping your personal information confidential.  The following policy describes what information we collect and how it is used and shared.

**Information Collected**  
Heroes Fanatic collects as little information as possible from users looking to post comments and messages in the forum.  We will typically collect a name (either real or alias), personal website, and e-mail address.

**Cookies / IP Address tracking**  
Heroes Fanatic uses cookies to uniquely identify users for the purpose of log files, posting comments, and voting on the site.  No personal information is stored in these cookies and it simply a way to identify your computer.

**With Whom Information is Shared**  
None of your information will be shared with third parties.  Heroes Fanatic may use your e-mail address in the future to contact you regarding the site, however, an opt-out will always be provided.  Your name and website may be displayed on the site if you post a comment or a message in the forum.  However, your e-mail address and privacy will always be kept secure.

**Opting Out**  
If Heroes Fanatic chooses to send out newsletter updates in the future and we have your email address on file, you may receive a copy of our newsletter.  However, at the bottom of every newsletter will be an easy way to opt-out.  The editors of our site hate SPAM as much as you and have no intention of filling up e-mail boxes with unwanted messages.
