**Hertz's Privacy Statement**

The Hertz Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Hertz") believe it is very important to protect the privacy of our customers. The following information concerning the gathering and use of data about our customers is being provided to enable you to make knowledgeable choices about whether to provide information to us and to give you the opportunity to direct us to limit the manner in which your data is used. 

Hertz does not knowingly solicit personal, family, residency or other personal information from persons under the age of twenty-one years; neither does it knowingly market to such people. 

This Privacy Statement reflects only the policies of The Hertz Corporation and its subsidiaries. 

If you use this website to send personal data to Hertz, your transmission will be protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL). SSL is a technology employed by Hertz that encrypts your information during transmission. 

It is our policy to take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is securely maintained with access limited to those who need such access to serve you. However, as discussed below, we may share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated companies where we are legally permitted to do so, subject to your rights described under Options to Limit Use of Data. It is a serious violation of Hertz policy for any employee of Hertz or its subsidiaries to use your personal data for any reason not described in this Privacy Statement. 

Hertz gathers data about its customers from various sources during the normal course of its business, including data supplied through this website. Personal data may also be available from reservation records, Hertz #1 Club and Hertz #1 Club Gold enrollment forms, and rental agreements. The types of personal information collected include names, addresses, employers, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, date of birth, driver's license numbers, credit card information, your selections with respect to car class and optional services, and rental history. 

In some cases, Hertz may create segments of information (known as "cookies") that enable us to recognize you from your computer when you revisit the Hertz website. Separate cookies may be created which recognize your name (if you have transmitted it to us in a prior visit from the same computer) and the date and time of your most recent visit. When, during your visit to the Hertz website, cookies containing your personal information are about to be created, you will be given the option to direct us not to create the cookie. You may also avoid the use of cookies by websites with which you communicate by turning off "cookies" on your computer's browser. 

Hertz also obtains information about customers and prospective customers from its affiliates and licensees and, where legally permitted, from other companies with which Hertz has business relationships. This information may be merged with or used to enhance individually identifiable information which we have collected previously for the purpose of marketing our products and services. 

The personally identifiable information which we collect through this website is initially used to satisfy rental reservations or to enable us to provide enhanced service, such as Hertz #1 Club and Hertz #1 Club Gold. We also aggregate and analyze personal information that we have collected from this website and other sources in order to enable Hertz to develop targeted marketing programs and service offerings tailored to the relevant customer base. The data allows special offers to be made to those customers most likely to avail themselves of the offers. If you breach a rental agreement or other agreement with Hertz or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, your personal data may be used, disclosed or passed to third parties to the extent necessary to assist recovery activities. 

Personal information is transmitted among The Hertz Corporation and its affiliates and licensees. (Hertz's affiliates include its subsidiaries; its majority stockholder, Ford Motor Company; and other subsidiaries of Ford Motor Company.) Where legally permitted, both aggregated information and personally identifiable information may also be given to unaffiliated companies for use in their marketing efforts. This information may be provided in exchange for similar data or for other business considerations. 

Members of Hertz #1 Club or Hertz #1 Club Gold have the following options to limit the use of their personal data: 

  1. Members may direct us not to provide their personally identifiable data to companies other than Hertz or its affiliates and licensees for marketing purposes. 

  2. Members may direct us not to send them any promotional offers and not to provide their personally identifiable data to our affiliates for marketing purposes.
