<h4>Use of Information</h4>

<p>Aggregate information about which pages visitors access or visit and any information volunteered by visitors is used only for the purpose outlined in that portion of our website (for example to enter a visitor in a contest or to send the visitor information) and for internal review as we continue to improve our website. This information is not sold to or shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. We do not rent, sell, nor share email addresses with any other company or organization. On occasion we make our customer list of names and mailing addresses (but not e-mail addresses or phone numbers) available to carefully screened companies with products we think may be of interest to our customers. Most of our customers enjoy receiving such material. If you prefer not to, please either call 1-800-281-7565, or email us at <b><a href="mailto:hersheygiftsinformation@hersheys.com">hersheygiftsinformation@hersheys.com</a></b> and we will remove your name from our list.</p>

<h4>Advertising</h4>

<img src="http://www.hersheys.com/privacy/img/kissad.gif" align="right">
<p>We follow the CARU guidelines in order to ensure that any advertising on our site is appropriate for our younger visitors. In order to help kids . . . and their parents . . . easily identify areas that may be considered advertising, we have included the icon you see here.</p>

<h4>Links</h4>

<p>Our policy is to link only to other sites which maintain the same safety and privacy standards to which we adhere. However, context on websites can change quickly, so we cannot always guarantee the appropriateness of the context of sites we link to.</p>
