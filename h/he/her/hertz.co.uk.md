 **Privacy Policy**

 **YOUR PRIVACY**

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal data we hold about you. This policy explains what data we collect about you, how we collect it, the measures we take to keep your data secure and the uses we make of it. We also explain the options you have in relation to your personal data.

When you request services from us, operate a vehicle or equipment with in-vehicle or in-equipment technology, access our websites, utilize our mobile “apps” or otherwise interact with us, for example, but without limitation, through our kiosks, our official corporate pages on third party social networks (such as Facebook) or the “apps” on those pages, you consent to our collection, retention and use of your personal data in the manner described in this policy and accept the risks outlined in the Security section.

 **SCOPE** This policy covers the personal data we collect about you in connection with our vehicle and equipment rental business which identifies you as an individual. It does not address data that does not personally identify you as an individual, for example, but without limitation, aggregated anonymous data, IP addresses, computer operating systems, personal preferences, vehicle identification numbers, etc. We are free to use data that does not identify you as an individual as we wish. This policy does not apply to data collected by third party social networks (such as Facebook), mobile device manufacturers, third party “mobile apps”, wireless service providers, internet service providers or the operators of any networks through which you may interact with us and we expressly disclaim any responsibility for the data collection, privacy or data security practices of those entities. With regard to pages on third party social networks, this policy only applies to personal data we collect through our pages (those with a direct link to this policy) and does not apply to any “unofficial” pages or pages of our affiliates or licensees. Our websites are not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly obtain personal data from such individuals.

 **Who we are    
**\--------------------------------------------------------

We are The Hertz Corporation, a U.S. company based in New Jersey, which, together with our subsidiary companies, provides and supports vehicle and equipment rental services worldwide. All references in this policy to “we”, “us” and “our” are to us and our subsidiaries. Our businesses generally operate under a “Hertz” mark, including Hertz Rent A Car, Hertz Local Edition, Hertz on Demand 24/7 (formerly known as Connect by Hertz), Hertz Claims Management, and Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation. In addition, our subsidiary Navigation Solutions, LLC, which provides the Hertz NeverLost service, is also covered by this policy. However, neither our Dollar Rent A Car or Thrifty Rent A Car businesses operated by Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc., a Hertz subsidiary, our Firefly Rent A Car business, nor our Donlen Corporation subsidiary are covered by this policy because each of those entities/operations has its own privacy policy. We also operate equipment rental businesses and, to a lesser extent, vehicle and equipment sales, and claims administration businesses.

We operate a network of licensees in provision of our services worldwide and are affiliated to many other companies through ownership. As our [licensees](https://web.archive.org/rentacar/navigation/templates/privacyPolicyView.jsp) and [affiliates](https://web.archive.org/rentacar/navigation/templates/privacyPolicyView.jsp) are independent companies, they are not owned or controlled by us and are not covered by this policy, although they may have their own privacy policies to govern the personal data they collect. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our licensees and affiliates.

 _ **More about subsidiaries, licensees and affiliates** …_

 _ **Subsidiaries:** These companies are owned by The Hertz Corporation and are covered by this policy. The expressions “we”, “us” and “our” apply to them, except for Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. which operates the Dollar Rent A Car and Thrifty Rent A Car businesses, Firefly Rent A Car, LLC, and Donlen Corporation which operates a fleet leasing and fleet management business._

 _ **Licensees:** We have a network of independent companies licensed to operate vehicle or equipment rental businesses using the “Hertz” name and business system. These companies may describe themselves as “Hertz System Licensees” or “Hertz Franchisees” to indicate that they are not our subsidiaries._

 _ **Affiliates:**  These companies either control us (through ownership) or are controlled by the companies that control us. They cover a range of businesses but are generally not involved in provision of our services to you. _  

 **Legal issues  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

We do business in many countries and aim to comply with the privacy laws applicable to the personal data we collect and use. 

The Hertz Corporation and those of its subsidiaries operating within the United States of America, comply with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, retention and use of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

 **Changes   
**\--------------------------------------------------------

We may change this policy from time to time. If we do so, the amended policy will take effect when we post it on our website. We will amend the “ **last updated** ” notice on the first page of this policy whenever we make a change. 

If any change makes the policy less protective of your personal data, it will not apply to data we collected about you before the change was made. The only exception to this is where we have told you about the changes and given you the opportunity to tell us not to apply them to your personal data.

 **COLLECTION  **

We collect a range of data about you from a variety of sources for the purposes of our business. The examples we provide here are illustrative rather than a complete list of our practices.

 **What we collect  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

We collect the personal data and the non-personal data we need to provide the services you request from us and for our operational uses in connection with such services, which may include:

  * Name, address and contact details, including telephone and mobile number, and email;

  * Date and place of birth, passport number and driver’s license number and, upon our request, a copy of your driver’s license;

  * Employer(s) name and address;

  * Credit card information;

  * Frequent flyer and other membership reward or loyalty program information;

  * Affiliations with companies, associations, colleges or cities;

  * Information regarding the vehicle or equipment rented and its operation during your rental;

  * Rental charges you incur and other information relating to your transactions;

  * Information transmitted by your computer’s browser software;

  * Itinerary information; and
  * Information about your credit history or other publicly available information about you from consumer reporting agencies.



We may collect personal data which is regarded as [sensitive data](https://web.archive.org/rentacar/navigation/templates/privacyPolicyView.jsp#sensitive_data#sensitive_data "sensitive data") in some countries, such as data about health conditions or membership of a trade union, which we are unable to process without your consent.

 _ **More about  sensitive data…**_

 _Data about your **health conditions** is regarded as sensitive in many countries. If you ask us to accommodate a disability, such as by provision of hand controls, or if there is an accident and we need to work with insurance and claims management companies relating to any injury you may incur, we may need to process data about your health conditions.  Similarly, in the EU, at least, your **membership of a trade union** or similar organization is regarded as sensitive and we may need to process this information if you use a CDP Number that only members of that union or organization can use._

 _Please note that **if you wish to rent with us or our licensees and need to provide sensitive data, you consent to that data being collected, used and disclosed for our Operational Uses.**  We will not use sensitive data about you for marketing purposes._

 **Websites  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

 **Our websites**

Certain technologies are used on our websites and on mobile devices to collect data about your visit or usage, as follows:

  **Cookies**

A “ **cookie** ” is a set of data sent to your computer or mobile device by a web server that enables the server to recognize your computer or mobile device.

Cookies help us improve the quality of your visits to our websites by making the reservation process faster and smoother. The information they provide helps us develop content and features that we think will be of interest to you.

We use cookies to: 

  * Track your use of our websites during a single visit, remember the data you provide and the choices you make as you progress from page to page (“ **session cookies** ”); and



  * Recognize you at your next visit (“ **persistent cookies** ”).




Third party cookies may also be used on our websites for the purpose of:

  * Such third parties providing goods or services to you (for example, but without limitation, an insurance carrier paying or reimbursing you for a vehicle or equipment in connection with insurance replacement rentals);

  * Performing services on our behalf;

  * Facilitating business transactions with or through such third parties; or

  * Providing advertisements to you.




 ** _More about cookies…_**

 _By adjusting your browser or installing certain software, you can restrict our use of cookies.   If you do this, you should be aware of the following:  _

 _•  If you restrict our use of **session cookies** you will not be able to use our websites or certain features of our e-mail messages. You should be aware that session cookies are generally deleted or made unavailable to us as soon as you close your browser._

 _•  If you restrict our use of **persistent cookies** you may still enjoy the full workings of our websites and e-mail messages but will need to re-enter some data when starting a new website session. Although persistent cookies will neither automatically be erased nor made unavailable to us upon closing your browser, they will typically “expire” after a number of years._

 _If you are still unsure about cookies, please note that our cookies are unable to retrieve other data from your computer’s hard drive or pass on computer viruses._    
 

  **Pixel tags**

In addition, “ **pixel tags** ”, “web beacons”, “JavaScript”, or similar technologies that enable, among other things, the tracking of your actions as a user of various websites or recipient of e-mail messages. (“Pixel Tags”) may be used. Pixel Tags may be used in connection with our web pages, our online advertising, or our e-mail messages, either by Hertz or by our service providers, business partners or other third parties.

Pixel Tags are used to collect typically anonymous data to help identify types of information, including popular destinations, average rental prices, quote and conversion rates, click-throughs and other information to improve the service you receive or the relevance of advertising directed to you. Pixel Tags may also be used to identify which online advertisement or email has brought you to a website.

 Further, certain Pixel Tags may be used by other companies for the purpose of tracking visits to their websites, identifying if such internet traffic came from a Hertz website or confirming your eligibility to receive services or benefits from such other companies.

As the internet and other eCommerce channels continue to develop, we may deploy and utilize different types of technologies to collect data regarding your visit or usage.

  **Blogs or Message Boards** Some of our websites and our official corporate pages on third party social networks (such as Facebook) may provide functionality that permits you to post public messages or responses to articles, comments or other postings. You should be aware that by submitting such a posting, including any personal data or non-personal data in connection with it, you intend for that posting and any data in connection with it to be, and it shall immediately become, public and as such will not be subject to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to remove any posting or content in a posting at our sole discretion.

 **Other company websites**

Our websites and e-mail messages may contain links to websites operated by other companies. You should be aware that the collection and use of any data you provide on these websites will be governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the website and not by this policy.

 **RETENTION**

We try to ensure that the personal data we retain about you is stored securely and, in light of the information provided to us, is as accurate, current and complete as necessary for the purposes for which we use it.

 **Storage  
** \--------------------------------------------------------  
We generally retain personal data about our customers for as long as we believe appropriate for the purposes for which it was collected or as otherwise required by applicable law.

 Our principal databases for storing the personal data we collect are located in Oklahoma, U.S.A., except for the Hertz on Demand 24/7 database, which is principally located in France and the Navigation Solutions, LLC database, which is principally located in Texas, U.S.A.

 **Security  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

As you may be aware, there is no completely secure method of transmitting or storing data. Although their physical characteristics are different, postal mail, telephone calls, text messages, faxes and transmissions over the Internet all present possibilities of loss, misrouting, interception and misuse of the data that is transmitted.

We take reasonable measures to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration and destruction of your personal data by aiming to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and electronic safeguards to protect your personal data, including:

  * Restricting access to personal data to our employees on a “need to know” basis; 

  * Enforcing policies and procedures for our employees in their handling of personal data; and

  * Using technologies designed to safeguard data during its transmission, including SSL encryption for the data you provide on our websites. 




If you have reason to believe that any account with us is no longer secure, you must immediately contact us by following the instructions at the end of this policy. 

  
 _ **More about  SSL encryption…**_

 _“SSL” stands for Secure Sockets Layer encryption. We use this protection for the data you submit to us on our websites.  SSL encryption seeks to ensure that you are actually sending your data to Hertz and that no-one else can read or tamper with it during transmission._

 _When you are asked to provide your personal data to us on our website, you will see that our “http” website address changes to read "https". The additional “s” denotes that the site is secure for that data transfer. You may also see a closed padlock symbol on your screen, again denoting a secure site._

 **Security of communications**

We try to strike a balance between the security of your data and your convenience. As a result, we may sometimes use a method of communication that is less secure than a less convenient alternative.

 For example, but not limitation, we will send you an e-mail or a text message in unencrypted form (i.e. instantly readable) because many of our customers are unable to access encrypted (i.e. coded) e-mail or messages. This means that our message, if misrouted or intercepted, could be read more easily than encrypted messages. For this reason, please do not include confidential information, such as your Hertz Gold Plus Rewards member number or credit card number, in any e-mail or text you send to us or on any posting you make to a public area of a third party social network page, especially since any such posting immediately becomes public.

For a more secure way to communicate with us over the Internet, please click on the “ **Contact Us** ” link on any page of [www.hertz.com](http://www.hertz.com/), [www.connectbyhertz.com](http://www.connectbyhertz.com/ "www.connectbyhertz.com"), or [www.hertzequip.com](http://www.hertzequip.com/ "www.hertzequip.com") or initiate a Live Chat session via [www.neverlost.com](http://www.neverlost.com/), and follow our instructions.

 **Access

To protect your privacy and the security of your personal data, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access or making corrections to the data we store about you.

Certain types of personal data may need to be updated with the third party social network through which you may interact with us, rather than directly with us.

  * If your Profile contains a customer discount program (CDP) number or you enrolled for Hertz on Demand 24/7 with a Promotion Code (PC) or through an affiliation, your CDP, PC or affiliation sponsor may have made marketing choices for users of that CDP, PC or affiliation. If the sponsor’s choices are more restrictive on our use of your data than your choices, we will observe the choices made by the sponsor in connection with those transactions in which such CDP, PC or affiliation is used.
