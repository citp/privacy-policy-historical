The information is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code, and decoded on our secure server. It cannot be read in transit.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: maroon;">Credit Card Fraud Protection</span><br>All major credit card companies protect cardholders against fraud, subject to a $25 deductible. HerbalRemedy.in will protect you for this $25 portion in the highly unlikely situation that you ever encounter an inappropriate charge involving our company.<br><br><span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">Information We Collect</span><br>In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority.

We keep this information for our internal use; we do not share it with others. <br><br>Our site uses cookies to store information between visits to our site. Cookies are a mechanism to remember information about a visitor from one page to another. Web browsers store cookies so that the browser itself can remember some information and then, on request, pass all that information up to the server at one time. We use cookies to remember your name and the contents of your shopping cart. This allows you to leave our site, come back later, and still have the contents of your shopping cart intact. It also lets us personalize your experience at HerbalRemedy.in, tailoring the content to your interests.<br><br>If you place an online order, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and financial information (such as your credit card numbers for purchases). Contact information from the order form (email address, name, billing and shipping address, and phone number) is used to send orders and information about our company to you. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you should we have questions regarding your order or should we need to notify you of the status of your order. And yes, you can opt not to get email from us, as described in the opt-out section below. The credit card information we collect is used ONLY to bill you for products you purchase. For your convenience, your information including credit card and order history is stored on a secure server that allows you to reorder by entering your email address and password. You will automatically be registered to receive our weekly newsletter unless you opt-out at the time of purchase. You may opt-out at any later time by following the unsubscribe instructions in the newsletter or by emailing us for the same.<br><br>We occasionally run our own online surveys and we ask visitors for contact information (such as email address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our company. You may opt-out of the survey and also opt-out of any future mailings at the time of the survey. The demographic information is used to learn more about the types of people who visit our site. This information is not shared with any other parties currently. We reserve the right to share this information with other parties in the future in an aggregated format that would not disclose any personally identifiable information. <br><br><span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">Opt-Out</span><br>If you decide to opt out of our newsletter, our emails provide you the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us. You can also opt-out by sending an email to us with the word unsubscribe followed by your email address in the subject line of the email.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: maroon;">Links</span><br>This site contains links to other sites.

We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. The information you send us is used to respond directly to your questions and comments. We also keep your email correspondence on file so that we may better serve you should you have additional questions in the future.
