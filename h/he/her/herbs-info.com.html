</p><p><font face="georgia, helvetica" size="4" color="#990000"><b>5. "Non-personally identifiable information" - Google Analytics, Cookies,
IP Address etc.</b></font>
</p><p>As you use This Website, information typically deemed as "non-personally identifying" may be collected using various systems such as,
but not limited to, cookies, server logs, Google Analytics and pixel tracking.  By using This Website, you consent to such data collection
and processing practices as set forth below.

</p><p><b>Log files</b>
</p><p>As with most web sites, logs are automatically created which register the IP address and other information such as the date and time
of access of This Website. I may use this information for general administrative, diagnostic or market research purposes. This web site uses
common server-side statistics utilities, such as Awstats, that are provided by This Website's hosting provider.   These utilities provide
user demographics such as the user's country and city of location, IP address, browser type, and keywords used in searches used to find this
site - and I may use such data for the purposes of optimizing the "performance" and quality of This Website, and for market research.
</p><p><b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b>

Website may use cookies and web beacons for the purposes of tracking user behaviour with regard to improving services and market research.
</p>

<p>Also, This Website may feature advertisements - and some third party advertisers' ads on This Website may place and read cookies on the
users' web browser, or use web beacons to collect information.   I have no access to or direct control over such cookies or web beacons.
</p>

<p>• Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website.<br>
• Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or

vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">aboutads.info</a>.)</p>

<p>This Website also features ads from Amazon.com and Amazon ads may place cookies on visitors browsers.  You may (possibly) be able to opt

<p>Most web browsers' default settings are to accept cookies automatically - however it is possible with almost all browsers to change
browser preferences, in order to refuse cookies or to request confirmation before accepting them.  Browsers typically offer options to view
and delete cookies that have already been placed on your browser.  For example - Mozilla: Tools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy &gt; Show Cookies
&gt; Remove Cookie.   As with many other sites, some features of this site and its services may not function correctly if cookies are
refused.

Google Analytics is transmitted to, and stored by Google Inc.   I have access to this data but have no control over how this information is
