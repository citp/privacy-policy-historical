### Privacy Policy

This site does not collect personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. The occasions of this collection are limited to a visitor using a feedback form, the "E-mail This Story" feature, in submitting a URL for the Web Directory, submitting a classified ad, subscribing to various email lists, or subscribing to The Herald printed newspaper. **Keyboard input from the user is necessary in all cases.**

**What we do with the information**

Specific information, such as names and e-mail addresses, provided by users in feedback forms and to e-mail news stories is used internally by **The Daily Herald Co.** and is never sold nor disclosed to a third party. Any information submitted and posted on the Web site is always at the user's request.

This Web site also collects some involuntary, nonidentifying information about its visitors. We record your IP address - a numeric identification assigned to your computer by your ISP (Internet Service Provider, such as, Earthlink, MSN, or AOL) - to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to help us identify whether you are a unique or repeat user to the site.
