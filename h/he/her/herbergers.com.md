This website is owned and operated by The Bon-Ton Department Stores, Inc., and this Privacy Policy applies to the website only.

We have posted this Privacy Policy here to inform you of the information we may collect, how it is handled and your rights to opt out of information disclosure. We value our customers and understand your concerns about privacy. Therefore, we have instituted policies intended to ensure your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.

This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of personal information we collect. We do not sell or rent the information you provide to us. We do, however, share your information with third parties under certain circumstances. We use this information for marketing and promotional purposes and to service your account. The examples provided below are illustrative and should not be considered a complete inventory of our information collection, use and sharing practices.

  * Information about your transactions with The Bon-Ton or others, such as your purchasing preferences;
  * And information from consumer reporting agencies, providers of marketing and demographic information and data collection agencies, such as customer names and mailing addresses, and information about your credit worthiness.  




### Information We May Disclose And To Whom We May Disclose Information

#### Disclosures Permitted By Law

The Bon-Ton may disclose your personal information without your consent as permitted by law. For example, we may use non-affiliated parties to perform services for us, such as providing customer assistance and customer billing, and we may disclose your personal information to consumer reporting agencies. We also may disclose information in response to requests from law enforcement agencies or in response to a subpoena or court order.

#### Other Disclosures

We may disclose the personal information we collect to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to companies that offer products or services you may find of value or to other financial institutions, such as insurers, with whom we have marketing agreements.

### Information Regarding Children

For their safety and privacy, we do not collect information from children under 13 years of age except as permitted by law.

### Our Security Procedures

To prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures. The Bon-Ton restricts access to personal information about you to those employees whom we determine have a legitimate business purpose to access such information in connection with the provision of products or services to you. We employ security techniques designed to protect our customer data. We provide training and communications programs designed to educate employees about the meaning and requirements of our strict standards for data security and confidentiality.
