## Cookies

When you visit the Website, the University may send your computer a "cookie", a small file that resides on your computer's hard drive and allows the University to determine return users of the Website and to review how a user uses a website in order to make it more useful by tailoring the services it offers to the way(s) in which a user accesses them. Each cookie is unique to you and it can be read by the server or your browser software. You can set your browser not to accept cookies, although you may not be able to access all of the features on the Website, or the site may operate less efficiently.

We may also use cookies to authenticate and record your acceptance to other applicable terms and conditions and also your acceptance to the handling of other information, including personal data that you may voluntarily provide from time-to-time.

Cookies cannot be executed as code or used to deliver a virus. Other servers cannot read them and personal information cannot be gathered from them. They are simply an identifier shared between you and us; we do not share them with anyone. A cookie does not give the University access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share.
