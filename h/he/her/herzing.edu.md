### Information Regarding Contacting Our Prospective Students by Telephone

Herzing University is in compliance with the FCC’s Amendments to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act which went into effect 10/16/2013. This act protects consumers by regulating the way in which companies can call consumer’s cell phones and send texts to those cell phones. Specifically, consumers must give a company, "prior express consent" (achieved by checking the box on the information request form page before form submission) to agree to allow that company to deliver information about their services via text messages, automatically dialed phone messages and/or pre-recorded voice information. While consent must be given to receive information via telephone, consent is not necessary to apply to or be admitted to the university.
