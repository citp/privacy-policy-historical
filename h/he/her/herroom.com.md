> 
> Andra Group L.P. does collect certain customer information. We use this information to process orders, enhance your shopping experience and communicate with our customers. 
> 
> We use order forms that allow you to buy our products. We collect your name, e-mail address, postal address, and credit card information. This information is used to process and send orders. We also use this information to contact you in case there is a question or problem with an order. 
> 
> When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may collect your name, e-mail address, and other demographic information, such as zip code, age, or income level. We use this contact information to send you information about our company and to contact you, if necessary. 
> 
> We also use data collected when you register, enter a contest, and make purchases to enhance and personalize your shopping experience. We may also send you email about updates and product offerings. You can unsubscribe to these emails at any time. 
> 
> We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer this website. We log IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to track a user's specific session, or to investigate cases of fraud or other security violations on our site.

> **What the heck are cookies and should I worry about them?**
> 
> Cookies are small pieces of information that most web sites use to make online navigation easier.

For instance, if you want to buy a gift for a friend and have it shipped to them; or, if you complete a "tell a friend" form on our site. Also, we may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to 1) comply with the law, 2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or 3) protect the rights, property, or safety of Andra Group L.P. and our users, or others.
