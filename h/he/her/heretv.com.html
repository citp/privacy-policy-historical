</p><p>This website is operated by here! Networks, LLC, the owner of the here!
programming service. You may contact us directly if you have any questions
regarding the content and material on this website, or the collection, use,
correction or deletion of any personal or non-personal information provided
over this website.

</p><p>Our postal address is:

</p><p>here! Networks

<br>19th Floor
<br>New York, NY 10022
<br>Attn: Interactive Department

</p><p>We can be reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@heretv.com">info@Heretv.com</a>


</p><p>heretv.com collects two types of personally identifying information from
users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated
data (such as information about traffic patterns on heretv.com, for example
how many users log into heretv.com on a daily basis). Personal data is
collected when users provide personal data to heretv.com, for example in
registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, in
answering surveys, purchasing items from heretv.com or its partners, and
registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by
heretv.com.

</p><p>Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and
information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site
registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, heretv.com
collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically
assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the
computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by
its IP address, and when you request a page from heretv.com, our servers log
your IP address. heretv.com does not link IP addresses to anything
personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will
remain anonymous to us. heretv.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of
system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the
volume of use on heretv.com.

</p><p>heretv.com also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small
data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record
keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow heretv.com to measure
activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by
remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to
visit various member-only parts of the Site without re-registering. Cookies
are used by Heretv.com to measure activity on the Site and make improvements
and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. heretv.com
does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not
originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily
provided by you (i.e., during newsletter registration or a contest),
heretv.com does not use information transferred through cookies for any
promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any
third parties whatsoever.

</p><p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can
set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function
properly if you do so.

</p><p>heretv.com uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for
multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the
Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual
user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or
opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.

</p><p>here! may also share information with consultants and affiliates for
internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such
information is subpoenaed, or if here! believes that any user has committed
unlawful acts, to acts that endanger the health or safety of another user or
of the general public. In some situations, we will share your personal
information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a
particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. Also, heretv.com
may be sold or transferred to another entity. Should such an event occur,
customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

</p><p>In addition, in the event here! plans to post any personal information on
the Site, here! will either notify you of this possibility when you provide
the information and/or, if possible, when the information is posted.

</p><p>Occasionally, we may post the name of a user (for example a contest winner)
on the Site. here! will notify you of this possibility when you provide your
information or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted.

</p><p><b>External and/or Third Party Sites</b>
<br>It is important to note that heretv.com contains links to sites other than
heretv.com, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as
heretv.com. For instance, if you click on a link on heretv.com, this will
take you away from heretv.com and to an entirely different site. This can
include links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use
heretv.com's logo and or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These
sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect data and make uses
of it that heretv.com would not.

</p><p>The use of any information or materials that you may access at these
external sites is purely voluntary. You should not rely on their contents
without independent and thorough review of the accuracy, completeness,
effectiveness, timeliness and correct sequencing. These external sites may
also refer to specific commercial products, processes, or services by trade
name, trademark, service mark, manufacturer or otherwise. Unless Here! has
provided specific authority, such references in no way indicate our
endorsement, recommendation or preference.

</p><p><b>Additional Information</b>
<br>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely
secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of here!
to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.
While we strive to protect your personal information, here! cannot ensure or
warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such
transmission is done at your own risk.

</p><p>Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall here!
be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages that result
from the use of information or materials on our sites, even if here! or an
authorized representative of here!, has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.

</p><p>USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF USAGE AGREEMENT
AND PRIVACY POLICY.

</p><p><b>here!</b> reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying
users of the existence of a revised privacy policy. You can send e-mail to
