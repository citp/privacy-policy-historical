**The Way We Use Information:**  
We use the information the Client provides when placing an order to complete that order and to provide the services requested. Personal contact information is provided to domain name provider and other third party service providers. ICANN requires domain name providers to make contact information or “WHOIS” information related to the registration of domain names public, including your name, address, phone number, fax number, email address. 

We use email addresses to answer the email we receive. We use email addresses provided as personally identifiable information to communicate with you regarding your account.
