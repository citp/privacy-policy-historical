# Privacy Policy - HTML5 tutorial

[home](https://www.html-5-tutorial.com/)

**The privacy of my visitors to html-5-tutorial.com is important to me.**

I recognize that privacy of your personal information is important and I collect no personal information, however I do keep log files and while I do not, my advertisers set cookies.

**Log Files**
    As with most other websites, I collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Chrome, FireFox or Internet Explorer), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout the site.
**Cookies**
    I use third party advertisements on html-5-tutorial.com to support my site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit my site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
