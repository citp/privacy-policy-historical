[home](http://www.html-5-tutorial.com/)

**The privacy of my visitors to html-5-tutorial.com is important to me.**

I recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information I receive and collect when you use and visit html-5-tutorial.com, and how I safeguard your information. I will never sell your personal information to third parties

**Newsletter**
    I only collect your email address. I will never share, sell or lease your email address to a third party for any reason. This is strictly opt-in. There is an opt-out link in each newsletter should you wish to stop receiving them. Look for "Here is an unsubscribe link" on the very bottom of the email.

To sign up for the newsletter please enter your email address:

**Log Files**
    As with most other websites, I collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Chrome, FireFox or Internet Explorer), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout the site.
**Cookies**
    I use third party advertisements on html-5-tutorial.com to support my site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit my site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
    You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
