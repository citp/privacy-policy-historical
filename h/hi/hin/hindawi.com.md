#### How We Look after Your Information and How Long We Keep It for

We operate a policy of “privacy by design” by looking for opportunities to minimise the amount of personal information we hold about you. We use appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect your information against any unauthorised access or unlawful use, such as:

  * ensuring the physical security of our offices or other sites;
  * ensuring the physical and digital security of our equipment and devices by using appropriate password protection and encryption;
  * maintaining a data protection policy for, and delivering data protection training to, our employees; and
  * limiting access to your personal information to those in our company who need to use it in the course of their work.



We will retain your information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested from us or long as we reasonably require to retain the information for our lawful business purposes, such as for the purposes of exercising our legal rights or where we are permitted to do. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold about you and the length of time that we need to keep it. For example,

  * we archive our email and paper correspondence regularly and destroy information no longer required for our legitimate purposes;
  * we retain information relating to job applicants for a period of 6 months from an application decision;
  * we retain certain information relating to your MTS Account (including Conflicts of Interest information) indefinitely for Research Integrity purposes and use appropriate safeguards to ensure the security of such information; and
  * we maintain a suppression list of email addresses of individuals who no longer wish to be contacted by us. So that we can comply with their wishes we must store this information permanently.



#### Help Keep Your Information Safe

You can also play a part in keeping your information safe by:

  * choosing a strong account password and changing it regularly;
  * using different passwords for different online accounts;
  * keeping your login and password confidential and avoiding sharing these details with others;
  * making sure you log out of the Site each time you have finished using it. This is particularly important when using a shared computer;
  * letting us know if you know or suspect that your account has been compromised, or if someone has accessed your account without your permission;
  * keeping your devices protected by using the latest version of your operating system and maintaining any necessary anti-virus software; and
  * being vigilant to any fraudulent emails that may appear to be from us. Any emails that we send will come from an email address ending in ‘hindawi.com’, including subdomains of ‘hindawi.com’, e.g. ‘@hindawi.com’ or ‘@journals.hindawi.com’.



#### International Transfers of Your Information

Our company is located in the UK. 

Many of our external third parties we engage to assist us in providing our Site and services to you, such as by providing hosting and IT services and journal production servers are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following transfer solutions are implemented:

  1. (a) we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see [European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en);
  2. (b) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, [European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en); and
  3. (c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see [European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).



A list of the countries outside of the EEA to which we may transfer your personal information is available here:

  * Philippines;
  * Egypt;
  * Republic of Korea;
  * USA; and
  * India.



Please contact us using the contact details at the top of this Privacy Policy if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
