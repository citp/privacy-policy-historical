<h3><a name="1" id="1"></a>1.	Our philosophy and approach</h3>
 <div align="justify">*   Involving like-minded organisations, associations and individuals in its different campaigns. The main intention is to create awareness among Hindus in the process.<br>
  *   The activities undertaken by the HJS comprises curbing denigration taking place through various mediums, advertisements, theatrical performances; curbing malpractices prevalent in public festivals; curbing degradation of Religious leaders and Saints, to provide religious education to Hindus, to curb conversion of Hindus, etc.<br>
  *   Any act that harms the interests of Hindu Dharma is notified to the society by creating public awareness regarding it and trying to stop it by lawful means. In such situations, the offenders are made aware of the harmful act committed by them. As a result, persons, organisations or business houses associated with such acts realise their mistake and accept it, thereby stopping such acts. If they don't accept their mistake after being intimated, then a written memorandum is handed over to them. If they do not pay any heed thereafter too, then the HJS adopts lawful measures such as organising protest marches, staging demonstrations, lodging police complaints, informing the Government, spreading such information through press conferences, seeking judicial help for justice, etc.<br>
  *   The HJS launches online protest campaigns against the concerned through its website www.hindujagruti.org. It also gives publicity to such protest campaigns through ‘Sanatan Prabhat's’ periodicals, other newspapers and news channels to create public awareness.<br>
  *   The Samiti is very prompt in its action against any incident regarding hurting of religious sentiments.<br>
  *   Samartha Ramdas Swami has said that, Every act one undertakes and every agitation one stages has potential and will succeed provided God’s will is invoked there of. As per this saying, the HJS, on the basis of divine support, makes righteous efforts as expected by Dharma. That is how each of its agitation is successful and beneficial to the society at large.
  <p></p>
 </div>
<p align="justify"><strong>Blessings of Saints</strong> - The campaigns and activities of the HJS have got overwhelming success and have proved to be very beneficial to the society, the reason being that they are backed by the blessings of Saints and divine energy of God. <br>

<ol>
  <li>	
    <div align="justify"><strong> What is a cookie?:</strong> A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. <br>
      <br>
    Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the Site to your interests.<br>
    <br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify"><strong> Control over a cookie: </strong>Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last option means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Site’s features. Each Internet browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. During the course of any visit to the site, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.<br>

In our effort to provide you with services customised to your interests, we use "cookies" to assist in the collection of information. When you register, we use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID.
      We and other third party providers that we commission, use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site. Tracking information such as cookies is also used to create aggregate reports on user demographics and Site traffic patterns. Information supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better online user experience and assist us to analyse the profile of our visitors. <br>
