						to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet 
						technology and to provide an interactive and 
						personalized experience. We may use Personally 
						Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, 
						street address, telephone number) subject to the terms 
						of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or 
						rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. 
						Period.
						<p><strong>How we gather information from users </strong>
						</p>
						<p>How we collect and store information depends on the 
						page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect 
						to participate and the services provided. For example, 
						you may be asked to provide information when you 
						register for access to certain portions of our site or 
						request certain features, such as newsletters or when 
						you make a purchase. You may provide information when 
						you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message 
						boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of 
						our site. Like most Web sites, HIWORLDARTICLES also 
						collects information automatically and through the use 
						of electronic tools that may be transparent to our 
						visitors. For example, we may log the name of your 
						Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to 
						recognize you and hold information from your visit. 
						Among other things, the cookie may store your user name 
						and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that 
						information each time you visit, or may control the 
						number of times you encounter a particular advertisement 
						while visiting our site. As we adopt additional 
						technology, we may also gather information through other 
						means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide 
						us with information, for example by setting your browser 
						to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be 
						unable to access certain portions of the site or may be 
						asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we 
						may not be able to customize the site's features 
						according to your preferences. </p>
						<p><strong>What we do with the information we collect
						</strong></p>
						<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to 
						enhance your visit and deliver more individualized 
						content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do 
						not share your information with anyone. </p>
						<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not 
						personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For 
						example, we may combine information about your usage 
						patterns with similar information obtained from other 
						users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to 
						learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
						most attractive). Aggregated Information may 
						occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business 
						partners. Again, this information does not include any 
						Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow 
						anyone to identify you individually. </p>
						<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information 
						collected on www.HIWORLDARTICLES.com to communicate with 
						you about your registration and customization 
						preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; 
						services and products offered by www.HIWORLDARTICLES.com 
						and other topics we think you might find of interest.
						</p>
						<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by 
						HIWORLDARTICLES may also be used for other purposes, 
						including but not limited to site administration, 
						troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, 
						administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
						communications with you. Certain third parties who 
						provide technical support for the operation of our site 
						(our Web hosting service for example) may access such 
						information. We will use your information only as 
						permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
						continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, 
						merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In 
						such transactions, user information may be among the 
						transferred assets. We may also disclose your 
						information in response to a court order, at other times 
						when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by 
						law, in connection with the collection of amounts you 
						may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities 
						whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please 
						note we may not provide you with notice prior to 
						disclosure in such cases. </p>
						<p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and 
						advertisements </strong></p>
						<p>HIWORLDARTICLES expects its partners, advertisers and 
						affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be 
						aware, however, that third parties, including our 
						partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content 
						providers accessible through our site, may have their 
						own privacy and data collection policies and practices. 
						For example, during your visit to our site you may link 
						to, or view as part of a frame on a 
						www.HIWORLDARTICLES.com page, certain content that is 
						actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, 
						through HIWORLDARTICLES you may be introduced to, or be 
						able to access, information, Web sites, features, 
						contests or sweepstakes offered by other 
						parties.HIWORLDARTICLES is not responsible for the 
						actions or policies of such third parties. You should 
						check the applicable privacy policies of those third 
						parties when providing information on a feature or page 
						operated by a third party. </p>
						<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional 
						partners or other third parties may use cookies or other 
						technology to attempt to identify some of your 
						preferences or retrieve information about you. For 
						example, some of our advertising is served by third 
						parties and may include cookies that enable the 
						advertiser to determine whether you have seen a 
						particular advertisement before. Other features 
						available on our site may offer services operated by 
						third parties and may use cookies or other technology to 
						gather information. HIWORLDARTICLES does not control the 
						use of this technology by third parties or the resulting 
						information, and is not responsible for any actions or 
						policies of such third parties. </p>
						<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily 
						disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message 
						boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed 
						publicly and can be collected and used by third parties 
						without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited 
						messages from other individuals or third parties. Such 
						activities are beyond the control of HIWORLDARTICLES and 
						this policy. </p>
						<p><strong>Children </strong></p>
						<p>HIWORLDARTICLES does not knowingly collect or solicit 
						Personally Identifiable Information from or about 
						children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we 
						discover we have received any information from a child 
						under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete 
						that information immediately. If you believe 
						HIWORLDARTICLES has any information from or about anyone 
						under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Contacting Us </strong></p>
						<p>We can be reached by emailing us. </p>
						<p><strong>Changes to this Policy </strong></p>
						<p>HIWORLDARTICLES reserves the right to change this 
						policy at any time. Please check this page periodically 
						for changes. Your continued use of our site following 
						the posting of changes to these terms will mean you 
						accept those changes. Information collected prior to the 
						time any change is posted will be used according to the 
						rules and laws that applied at the time the information 
						was collected. </p>
						<p><strong>Governing law </strong></p>
						<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by 
						Norwegian law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we 
						agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a 
						mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: 
						Kristiansund. Any costs and fees other than attorney 
						fees associated with the mediation will be shared 
						equally by each of us. </p>
						<p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are 
						not intended to and do not create any contractual or 
						other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. </p></td>
