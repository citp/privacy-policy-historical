<div align="center"><strong>YOUR PRIVACY IS OUR PRIORITY
  </strong>
</div>
<p>At Higher One, we want you to know that we take your privacy and online security
  very seriously. During activation, you’re providing us with personal information about
  yourself. Higher One understands the importance of protecting the safety and confidentiality of the information you provide and 
    we treat this information with the utmost security and respect.</p>
<p>In addition to any legal compliance associated with the handling of your information,
  Higher One wants to earn your trust. So we’ve taken a number of steps
  to make sure that your information is completely safe, including but not limited
to:
</p><ul><li>Implementing numerous stringent physical and electronic security features
  to prevent unauthorized access. </li>
  <li>Conducting frequent reviews of our computer
  systems, including security features and data encryption.</li>
  <li>Limiting employee
      access to customer information to only those employees who need it for
    the normal performance of their jobs. Our employees are
        required to acknowledge, in writing, their responsibility to maintain
    the confidentiality
  of all customer information. </li>
  <li>We always apply the same privacy policies
      and practices to our former customers that we do to our existing customers.<p></p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>You Can Help Too</strong><br>
    There are important steps you can take yourself to help insure the
  safety of your information online. Some suggestions include:</p><ul>
  <li>Never leave your computer in the middle of an online session. </li>
  <li>When you’re
      done with an online session, make sure you log off of the program website
      before you move on to other sites.</li>
  <li>Never share your password with anyone.</li>
  <li>If other people have access to your
        computer, clear your browser's cache to remove copies of web pages that
      may have been temporarily stored on
            your computer. Check your browser's Help file for instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keeping Your Information Private</strong><br>
  Occasionally, there may be products or services, either from our own affiliated
  companies or businesses that have partnered with us, which we think may be
  of interest to you. If we feel these products and services would provide added
  value to a cardholder, you’ll hear about these special offers from us,
  and not from a third party. Rest assured that Higher One would never share
  information with a company or entity that is not affiliated with us. You can
  control how Higher One contacts you through the notifications page on the Higher OneCard
  website. Just log in and select “Profile“, then “Notifications“ from the main menu 
    bar.
  We may also share your contact information such as name, address, phone number
  and email address with the university so that we, and they, can better serve
  you. </p>
<p><strong>Our First Priority…Is You</strong><br>
  Your trust in Higher One is absolutely essential to us. That’s why it’s
  critical that Higher One go above and beyond what’s required of us to
  assure you and your family that we’re concerned and proactive with your
  online security. If you have problems or concerns, you can contact Customer
  Service anytime, 24 hours a day. Log on to your program website, and click
  on the link for “EasyHelp”, where you can find answers to frequently
  asked questions, or even submit a question or concern. <br>
