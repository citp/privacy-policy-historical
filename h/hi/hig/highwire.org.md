# HighWire Privacy Policy

HighWire Press respects your privacy. We do not sell, exchange, or release your personal information (name, email address) without your consent, regardless of its source, to any third parties. Information is given to HighWire-affiliated publishers in the form of 1) grouped statistics compiled from registration data and log file data (none of this data provided is personally identifiable), and 2) e-mail addresses/contact names of users whose alerts make use of that particular publishers' journal(s), as mentioned below. Information gathered through the use of cookies is not related to any personally identifiable details. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy please send us [feedback](https://web.archive.org/cgi/feedback). 

**Information Collection and Use**

While using the HighWire Press web site, you can establish a customized account that requires the input of account information (name, email address and password) and personalization preferences (selected journals, email alerts, article preferences). We do not gather financial or demographic information. We maintain this information in strict privacy and do not share it with others except in the form of grouped statistics. None of the shared data is personally identifiable. You can update or delete your account and preference choices at anytime. 

In the case of our alerting services (such as [eTOCS and Citetrack](https://web.archive.org/customize/#myalerts)), the e-mail addresses and names of users who elect to be alerted about content in the participating journals are sent to those journals; journals may use this information for marketing purposes. 

HighWire Press automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including information such as the name of the domain and host from which you are accessing the Internet (for example, aol.com or stanford.edu); the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer; the type of browser software you are using; and the pages you request for viewing. This information is used to understand how our site is being used. HighWire Press does not use this information to individually identify specific users and your activity on our site. Aggregated reports on overall site usage are developed and shared with HighWire-affiliated publishers, but individuals and their specific usage details are never personally identified. 

As part of the registration process, you have the option to allow your name and email address to be supplied to HighWire-affiliated publishers to receive email information about their associations and publications. You can decide to accept or decline this option during the registration process or at any time by selecting [modify my personal information](https://web.archive.org/cgi/changeuserinfo). 

**Use of Cookies**

You can still use our site without cookies being involved as long as you do not register, sign in, or use the personalization features. 

HighWire Press does not look at or track any personal or confidential information about our users. Cookies created while visiting the HighWire Press site are deleted when you click "Sign Out". If you do not sign out, then the cookies will remain until you quit your browser.
