**Customer Kudos**  
_Just placed order on-line and thought I would follow-up with e-mail. I was just looking back at my notes/e-mails and wanted to say thank you again for all your help.  
Sometimes customers forget to say thanks to good people that go out of their way to help.  
You've done a great job helping me.   
Have a Great Day.   
Bill W. _
