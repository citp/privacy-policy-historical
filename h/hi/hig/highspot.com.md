**Last Updated: April 16, 2019**

This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by Highspot, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Highspot,” “we,” or “us”). This Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website and other online products and services that link to this Policy (our “Services”), visit our facilities, and attend functions hosted or sponsored by Highspot. It also applies to information we collect from third parties for our own business interests. This Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and process information that is related to an identified or identifiable individual (“Personal Data”).

We may make changes to this Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice, such as adding a statement to our homepage or notifying you via email. We encourage you to review this Policy frequently to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

#### Highspot as Controller

Highspot is the controller of Personal Data to the extent we have identified a valid purpose and means of processing Personal Data, as described in this Policy.

Highspot is not responsible for and does not control the privacy and data security practices of its customers, which may differ from those in this Policy. If your data was submitted to us by, or on behalf of, a Highspot customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with the applicable customer directly. Because we may only access customer data upon request from that customer or to comply with legal obligations, if you wish to make a request directly to us, please provide the name of the Highspot customer who submitted your data to us along with your request, and email [support@highspot.com](mailto:support@highspot.com).

#### EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks

Highspot complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, processing, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom and/or Switzerland (“EU Data”) to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield. Highspot has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict between the terms in the policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit the [Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Highspot commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. Individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield should first contact Highspot at [privacy@highspot.com](mailto:privacy@highspot.com).

If Highspot does not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge for resolution to [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/sitemap) for mediation, pursuant to the JAMS International Mediation Rules. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. Highspot is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If Highspot shares EU Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on Highspot’s behalf, then Highspot may be held liable for that third party’s processing of EU Data in violation of the Principles, unless Highspot can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Highspot has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland in the context of an employment relationship.
