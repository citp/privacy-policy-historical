			our use of your personally identifiable information and how you can access and update this information.</p>

			<p>Internet Employment Linkage has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and
			our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal.</p>

			<h2>PRIVACY PHILOSOPHY</h2>

			<p>Internet Employment Linkage Inc., publisher of HigherEdJobs.com, has created this Privacy Policy
			to demonstrate our firm commitment to keeping personally identifiable information private. Our data collection
			policies allow you to choose how much information you provide us and how we use the information
			you have shared.  It is our intent to use this information to help further your success in seeking
			or filling a position in the field of higher education through the use of our website.</p>

			<h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>

			<p>A. Anonymous Information. You can always browse the Public Site and
					search for posted positions without providing any personally identifiable information to
					HigherEdJobs.com. We gather general
					information about the number of users browsing the website, the number of
					users who view certain posted positions, and how users navigate through our Web
					Site. This information is collected
					anonymously and only in the aggregate.
					We use this information to provide aggregated statistical feedback to
					the institutions posting positions on our website, to publicize our website
					and to further develop our website to maximize the benefits realized by our
					users.</p>

			<p>B. Personally Identifiable Information. 
					HigherEdJobs.com collects personally identifiable
					information when you register for a personal account through HigherEdJobs.com,
					create a Resume Profile and when you elect to receive information from us
					through Insider Update or other similar "opt-in" services we may provide.
					"Opt-in" services are only offered when the
					user purposefully checks a box or another method of indicating their specific
					intention of being included for the service so provided. When you create a user ID and password, we
					collect your name, e-mail address, state and country of residence,
					academic/administrative focus, years in higher education and years of work
					experience. We may also request other
					information such as your ZIP Code, career level, highest degree earned, salary
					level and professional affiliations.
					Any information you provide to HigherEdJobs.com when registering for a
					personal account is maintained and accessible only by HigherEdJobs.com. We use this information in the aggregate for
					demographic purposes. We may use that
					information to e-mail you information about maintenance schedules, new
					institutional subscribers information, as well as special promotions and other
					general updates from HigherEdJobs.com or third parties that may be relevant to
					you and your search for a position in higher education. HigherEdJobs.com provides
					you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of
					communications at the time of registration or by opting in for a particular
					service, and later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply follow the
					opt-out procedures contained on the website.
					WE DO NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE SHARE ANY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER 
					THAN IS OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

			<p>We post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information such 
					as the customer's name.  We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post 
					their name along with their testimonial.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial,
					you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@higheredjobs.com">privacy@higheredjobs.com</a>.</p>
	
			<p>C. Resume Center. If you register for a personal HigherEdJobs
					account, you will have the option of posting a form of your resume on the
					Restricted Site. We request certain
					personally identifiable information in order for you to post your resume, such as your name
					and address, e-mail address and experience working in higher education.
					We include this information, when and only
					if you so elect, in a database for institutional and other paying subscribers
					to search for potential candidates online. 
					In addition, you have the ability to draft a personal resume and cover
					letter in the resume textbox. There are
					two primary ways you can use the Resume Center:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>You can create and store your resume on our database, but <u>not</u>
						allow it to be searched by any institutions of higher education or other
						employer-subscribers. Not allowing your
						resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a position
						online, but it will <u>not</u> be searchable through our Resume Database.</li>
					<li style="margin-top:8px;">You can store your resume in our database and allow it to be searched by
						universities and employers that subscribe for access to our resume
						database. You may elect to have your
						personal contact information disclosed to universities and employers searching
						our database, or not have any personal contact information disclosed. You may remove
						your resume from our searchable database at any time.
						However, university and other subscribers who have paid for
						access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own
						files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy
						of resumes, nor any information disclosed on your resume or cover letter posted
						on our website. Please note that once
						you create a resume online and permit it to be searched, all information
						contained in your resume and cover letter can be collected and used by our
						paying subscribers. This may result in
						unsolicited messages from third parties, for which Internet Employment Linkage,
						Inc. is not responsible.</li>
				</ol>
			

			<p id="cookies">D. Tracking Technologies. Technologies such as: COOKIES, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Internet Employment Linkage, Inc.
				and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the
				site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports
				based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
			</p>

			<p>We use COOKIES for our user authentication, shopping cart, and to remember users' settings.  Users can control the use of cookies at the
				individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>

			<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol
				(IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
				We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>

			<p>We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features
				on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers
				may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>
	
			<p>E. Job Postings. 
					Persons, whether as individuals or as employees of a business who use the Employer
					Section or the Single Posting Pages of the website may be asked for their
					business email addresses, business address and phone, billing information, and
					a password. Although there is no cost
					to Job Seekers for using the services on the website, Job Posters will be
					charged a fee for requested services. 
					We use data collected from Job Posters to provide requested
					services.</p>

			<p>F. Payments By Credit Card. We use an outside bank merchant account to
					verify credit card data so we can bill and account for products sold to Job
					Posters. This company does not retain, share, store or use credit card data
					for any other purposes.</p>

			<p>G. Third Party Advertisers.  The ads appearing on this website are delivered to users by
					third party ad servers.   We share website usage information about users with reputable third
					parties for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site.</p>

					<p>Our third party advertisers use cookies, which allow it to recognize a user's cookie
						when a user visits this site. The information that our ad server collects and shares
						through this technology is not personally identifiable.</p>

					<p>If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads,
					you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">Here</a>.
					Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

			<p>H. Blogs. Our website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any
				information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request
				removal of your personally identifiable information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:jobseeker@higheredjobs.com">jobseeker@higheredjobs.com</a>.
				In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
	
			<h2>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>

			<p>
				Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your
				individual visits to our site, or personally identifiable information that you provide, such
				as your name, e-mail address, faculty area, or professional associations to any
				outside parties.
				(We may disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law,
				such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process; when we believe
				in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
				investigate fraud, or respond to a government request).
			</p>

			<p>
				If Internet Employment Linkage is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a
				portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web
				site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices
				you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.
			</p>

			<p>We may also provide your personally identifiable information to companies that provide services
					to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies
					are authorized to use your personally identifiable information <em>only as necessary to provide</em> these services to us.</p>

			<h2>LINKS TO 3<sup>RD</sup> PARTY SITES</h2>

			<p>Our Site includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of
					Internet Employment Linkage. If you submit personally identifiable information to any of
					those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to
					carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>

			<h2>SOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS</h2>

			<p>Our website includes Social Media Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs
					that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site,
					and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either
					hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by
					the privacy policy of the company providing it. </p>

			<h2>YOU CAN MODIFY YOUR INFORMATION AT ANY TIME</h2>

			<p>HigherEdJobs.com allows you to change, correct or
					remove your personally identifiable information from the website at any time. To do so,
					simply log into your HigherEdJobs account, go to your account profile, and
					you will find options for editing the information you have submitted.
					Alternatively, you may contact our Customer Support by emailing us at <a href="mailto:jobseeker@higheredjobs.com">jobseeker@higheredjobs.com</a>
					by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.
					We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe.
					We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
					We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and 
					enforce our agreements.</p>

			<p>You may also opt-out of 
					any communication by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by 
					emailing us at <a href="mailto:jobseeker@higheredjobs.com">jobseeker@higheredjobs.com</a>.
					In order to keep information fresh and
					pertinent, your account on the restricted site (My Account) will be deleted
					after six (6) months of non-use. In
					addition, our website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
					communications from us. Users may
					change this information any time and as often as necessary. HigherEdJobs.com does reserve the right to
					send a one-time registration confirmation e-mail, and infrequent service
					messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes to HigherEdJobs.com's
					services or special alerts, regardless of email contact opt-in status. Examples
					of such a special alert message, to the email address you supplied, would be
					notification of the impending closing of an account that is believed to be
					abandoned or the addition of important new features to an existing service.</p>

			<p>Job Posters may update their account information
					and manage their job postings by logging into their account through the Post a
					Job section of our website.</p>

			<h2>SECURITY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE</h2>

			<p>This website has security
					measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information
					contained on our website. During the
					subscription or registration process, you will have the option to provide a
					password for your account. We authenticate
					your access to our website through your use of your user ID and password, and
					protect your information with firewall protections.
					 Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and
					enhanced as necessary. Particularly
					sensitive information, such as a college or university's credit card number
					collected for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission using
					a Blowfish Encryption Algorithm and purged upon receipt. See
					<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html" target="_blank">www.schneier.com/blowfish.html</a>
					for more information on the protections provided by this encryption.
					Please be advised that you are ultimately
					responsible for the security of your HigherEdJobs.com user ID and password.
					Please take care to store your
					HigherEdJobs.com user ID separately from your account password, or better yet,
					choose a password that you do not need to write down at all.</p>

			<p>The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number)
				on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

			<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and
				once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
				Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can
				contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@higheredjobs.com">privacy@higheredjobs.com</a>.</p>
	
			<h2>CHILDREN</h2>

			<p>We do not specifically collect information about
			children, nor do we authorize use of this website by children.</p>

			<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

			<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
					statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are
					always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
					circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
					We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
					which the information was collected.</p>

			<p>If, however, we are going to
					use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
					stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email prior to the change becoming effective. Users will
