		<h2>PRIVACY PHILOSOPHY</h2>
		
		<p>Internet Employment Linkage Inc., publisher of HigherEdJobs.com, has created this Privacy Policy
		to demonstrate our firm commitment to keeping personal information private. Our data collection
		policies allow you to choose how much information you provide us and how we use the information
		you have shared.&nbsp; It is our intent to use this information to help further your success in seeking
		or filling a position in the field of higher education through the use of our Web Site.</p>
		
		<h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>
		
		<p>A. Anonymous Information. You can always browse the Public Site and
				search for posted positions without providing any personal information to
				HigherEdJobs.com. We gather general
				information about the number of users browsing the Web Site, the number of
				users who view certain posted positions, and how users navigate through our Web
				Site. This information is collected
				anonymously and only in the aggregate.&nbsp;
				We use this information to provide aggregated statistical feedback to
				the institutions posting positions on our Web Site, to publicize our Web Site
				and to further develop our Web Site to maximize the benefits realized by our
				users.</p>
		
		<p>B. Personally Identifiable Information. 
				HigherEdJobs.com collects personally identifiable
				information when you register for a personal account through My HigherEdJobs,
				create a Resume Profile and when you elect to receive information from us
				through Insider Update or other similar "opt-in" services we may provide.
				"Opt-in" services are only offered when the
				user purposefully checks a box or another method of indicating their specific
				intention of being included for the service so provided. When you create a user ID and password, we
				collect your name, e-mail address, state and country of residence,
				academic/administrative focus, years in higher education and years of work
				experience. We may also request other
				information such as your zip code, career level, highest degree earned, salary
				level and professional affiliations.&nbsp;
				Any information you provide to HigherEdJobs.com when registering for a
				personal account is maintained and accessible only by HigherEdJobs.com. We use this information in the aggregate for
				demographic purposes. We may use that
				information to e-mail you information about maintenance schedules, new
				institutional subscribers information, as well as special promotions and other
				general updates from HigherEdJobs.com or third parties that may be relevant to
				you and your search for a position in higher education. HigherEdJobs.com provides
				you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of
				communications at the time of registration or by opting in for a particular
				service, and later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply follow the
				opt-out procedures contained on the Web Site.&nbsp;
				WE DO NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE SHARE ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER 
				THAN IS OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
				
		<p>We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such 
				as the customer's name.  We do obtain the customer's consent prior to to posting the testimonial to post 
				their name along with their testimonial.</p>		
		
		<p>C. Resume Center. If you register for a personal My HigherEdJobs
				account, you will have the option of posting a form of your resume on the
				Restricted Site. We request certain
				personal information in order for you to post your resume, such as your name
				and address, e-mail address and experience working in higher education.
				We include this information, when and only
				if you so elect, in a database for institutional and other paying subscribers
				to search for potential candidates online.&nbsp;
				In addition, you have the ability to draft a personal resume and cover
				letter in the resume textbox. There are
				two primary ways you can use the Resume Center:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>You can create and store your resume on our database, but <u>not</u>
					allow it to be searched by any institutions of higher education or other
					employer-subscribers. Not allowing your
					resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a position
					online, but it will <u>not</u> be searchable through our resume database.</li>
				<li>You can store your resume in our database and allow it to be searched by
					universities and employers that subscribe for access to our resume
					database. You may elect to have your
					personal contact information disclosed to universities and employers searching
					our database, or limit the personal contact information displayed to your
					e-mail address only. You may remove
					your resume from our searchable database at any time.
					However, university and other subscribers who have paid for
					access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own
					files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy
					of resumes, nor any information disclosed on your resume or cover letter posted
					on our Web Site. Please note that once
					you create a resume online and permit it to be searched, all information
					contained in your resume and cover letter can be collected and used by our
					paying subscribers. This may result in
					unsolicited messages from third parties, for which Internet Employment Linkage,
					Inc. is not responsible.</li>
