			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Internet
				Employment Linkage Inc., publisher of HigherEdJobs.com, has created this
				Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to keeping personal
				information private. Our data
				collection policies allow you to choose how much information you provide us and
				how we use the information you have shared.&nbsp;
				It is our intent to use this information to help further your success in
				seeking or filling a position in the field of higher education through the use
				of our Web Site.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW 
				WE USE IT</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A. Anonymous Information. You can always browse the Public Site and
				search for posted positions without providing any personal information to
				HigherEdJobs.com. We gather general
				information about the number of users browsing the Web Site, the number of
				users who view certain posted positions, and how users navigate through our Web
				Site. This information is collected
				anonymously and only in the aggregate.&nbsp;
				We use this information to provide aggregated statistical feedback to
				the institutions posting positions on our Web Site, to publicize our Web Site
				and to further develop our Web Site to maximize the benefits realized by our
				users.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">B. Personally Identifiable Information. 
				HigherEdJobs.com collects personally identifiable
				information when you register for a personal account through eSearchManager,
				create a Resume Profile and when you elect to receive information from us
				through Insider Update or other similar "opt-in" services we may provide.
				"Opt-in" services are only offered when the
				user purposefully checks a box or another method of indicating their specific
				intention of being included for the service so provided. When you create a user ID and password, we
				collect your name, e-mail address, state and country of residence,
				academic/administrative focus, years in higher education and years of work
				experience. We may also request other
				information such as your zip code, career level, highest degree earned, salary
				level and professional affiliations.&nbsp;
				Any information you provide to HigherEdJobs.com when registering for a
				personal account is maintained and accessible only by HigherEdJobs.com. We use this information in the aggregate for
				demographic purposes. We may use that
				information to e-mail you information about maintenance schedules, new
				institutional subscribers information, as well as special promotions and other
				general updates from HigherEdJobs.com or third parties that may be relevant to
				you and your search for a position in higher education. HigherEdJobs.com provides
				you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of
				communications at the time of registration or by opting in for a particular
				service, and later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply follow the
				opt-out procedures contained on the Web Site.&nbsp;
				WE DO NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE SHARE
				ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER THAN IS OUTLINED IN
				THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">C. Resume Center. If you register for a personal eSearchManager
				account, you will have the option of posting a form of your resume on the
				Restricted Site. We request certain
				personal information in order for you to post your resume, such as your name
				and address, e-mail address and experience working in higher education.
				We include this information, when and only
				if you so elect, in a database for institutional and other paying subscribers
				to search for potential candidates online.&nbsp;
				In addition, you have the ability to draft a personal resume and cover
				letter in the resume textbox. There are
				two primary ways you can use the Resume Center:</font></p>
			<ol>
				<li> 
					<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can create and store your resume on our database, but <u>not</u>
						allow it to be searched by any institutions of higher education or other
						employer-subscribers. Not allowing your
						resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a position
						online, but it will <u>not</u> be searchable through our resume database.</font></p>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You
						can store your resume in our database and allow it to be searched by
						universities and employers that subscribe for access to our resume
						database. You may elect to have your
						personal contact information disclosed to universities and employers searching
						our database, or limit the personal contact information displayed to your
						e-mail address only. You may remove
						your resume from our searchable database at any time.
						However, university and other subscribers who have paid for
						access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own
						files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy
						of resumes, nor any information disclosed on your resume or cover letter posted
						on our Web Site. Please note that once
						you create a resume online and permit it to be searched, all information
						contained in your resume and cover letter can be collected and used by our
						paying subscribers. This may result in
						unsolicited messages from third parties, for which Internet Employment Linkage,
						Inc. is not responsible.</font></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">D. Other Technical Information/Cookies. 
				We collect an
				IP address from all visitors to our Web Site.&nbsp;
				We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to
				administer our Web Site. In addition to
				information provided by your browser, we use "cookies" for remembering your
				preferences, maintaining information about whether you are currently logged
				into our systems, and tracking click streams.&nbsp;
				Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service,
				consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site experience. Cookies
				in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do
				identify a user's computer. Most
				browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can set
				your browser to refuse cookies. In the
				event you refuse cookies, however, you may not be able to take advantage of
				benefits offered by our Web Site.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">E. Job Postings. 
				Persons, whether as individuals or as employees of a business who use the Employer
				Section or the Single Posting Pages of the Web Site may be asked for their
				business email addresses, business address and phone, billing information, and
				a password. Although there is no cost
				to Job Seekers for using the services on the Web Site, Job Posters will be
				charged a fee for requested services.&nbsp;
				We use data collected from Job Posters to provide requested
				services. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">F. Payments By Credit Card. 
				We use outside company products,
				Verisign PayFlow Pro (<a href="http://www.verisign.com/" target="_blank">http://www.Verisign.com</a>)
				through Oracle Small Business 
				(<a href="http://www.oraclesmallbusiness.com/" target="_blank">http://www.OracleSmallBusiness.com</a>),
				 to verify credit card data so we can bill and account for
				products sold to Job Posters. This company does not retain, share, store or use
				credit card data for any other purposes.&nbsp;</font></p>
				
				
				
			<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</font></b></font></p>
			<p> <font face="Arial" size="2">Except
				as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your
				individual visits to our site, or personal information that you provide, such
				as your name, e-mail address, faculty area, or professional associations to any
				outside parties, except when we believe, in good faith, that such release is
				reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, or (ii) protect the rights,
				property or safety of HigherEdJobs.com, our users, or others. </font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>YOU CAN MODIFY YOUR INFORMATION 
				AT ANY TIME</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">HigherEdJobs.com allows you to change, correct or
				remove your personal information from the Web Site at any time. To do so,
				simply log into your eSearchManager account, go to your account profile, and
				you will find options for editing the information you have submitted. In order to keep information fresh and
				pertinent, your account on the restricted site (eSearchManager) will be deleted
				after six (6) months of non-use. In
				addition, our Web Site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
				communications from us. Users may
				change this information any time and as often as necessary. HigherEdJobs.com does reserve the right to
				send a one-time registration confirmation e-mail, and infrequent service
				messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes to HigherEdJobs.com’s
				services or special alerts, regardless of email contact opt-in status. Examples
				of such a special alert message, to the email address you supplied, would be
				notification of the impending closing of an account that is believed to be
				abandoned or the addition of important new features to an existing service.
				<br><br>
				Job Posters may update their account information
				and manage their job postings by logging into their account through the Post a
				Job section of our Web site.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>SECURITY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This Web Site has security
				measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information
				contained on our Web Site. During the
				subscription or registration process, you will have the option to provide a
				password for your account. We authenticate
				your access to our Web Site through your use of your user ID and password, and
				protect your information with firewall protections.
				 Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and
				enhanced as necessary. Particularly
				sensitive information, such as a college or university’s credit card number
				collected for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission using
				a Blowfish Encryption Algorithm and purged upon receipt. See
				<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html" target="_blank">www.schneier.com/blowfish.html</a>
				for more information on the protections provided by this encryption.
				Please be advised that you are ultimately
				responsible for the security of your HigherEdJobs.com user ID and password.
				Please take care to store your
				HigherEdJobs.com user ID separately from your account password, or better yet,
				choose a password that you do not need to write down at all.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>CHILDREN</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We do not specifically collect information about
				children, nor do we authorize use of this Web Site by children.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</font></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If we decide
				to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
				statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are
				always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
				circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp;
				We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
				which the information was collected. <br>
				<br>
				If, however, we are going to
				use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
				stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will
				have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different
				manner. However, if users have opted
				out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account,
				then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in
				this new manner. In addition, if we
				make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user
				information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on
				our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a
				notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from
				us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.<br>
				<br>
				If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about HigherEdJobs.com's 
				Privacy Policy, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@HigherEdJobs.com">privacy@HigherEdJobs.com</a>.
