Who are we?
We are Highsoft AS. Our address is Sentrumsgata 44, 6893 Vik i Sogn, Norway.
You can contact us by postal mail at the above address, or by email at privacy@highsoft.com
In collecting information about you, we are acting as a data controller and we are required to
provide you with information about why and how we use your data, and about the rights you
have over your data.
We are not required to have a data protection officer, so any enquiries about our use of your
personal data should be addressed to the contact details above.
Introduction
Highsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. Any and all information collected is
safeguarded according to the applicable legislation concerning personal data and is updated to
comply to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from May 25,
2018.
This privacy policy tells you about the personal identifiable information (PII) we collect when you
use and interact with our website.
How we use your information
In the course of providing products and services to our visitors and customers, we collect or
receive your personal information in different ways.
We collect and process information about you only where we have legal basis for doing so
under applicable EU laws, even if you reside outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).
You provide some of this data directly, and some data we get by collecting data about your
interactions, usages and experiences with our products. We will give you the chance to choose
what information to provide for e.g. research and development and to market and promote the
products or services, but sometimes we require certain information in order to provide certain
products and services and to protect our, and your legal rights and interests. Below are more
details on each interaction with our website, and how we will handle your PII.
Information storage and security
Highsoft relies on third-party partners to provide many of the features and functionality on our
websites and services, to collect data about you and your use of our websites and services.
We have contractual agreements with all third-party data processors that commits them to
providing an appropriate level of safeguards for your personal data, which includes compliance
 Version 1.0.1                    Page 4 of 17


                                          Website Privacy Policy
to GDPR and Highsoft will make every commercially viable measure to secure your data
according to GDPR guidelines.
Most of our data is collected and processed within the European Economic Area (EEA). For
processing that is taking place outside the EEA, we have in addition to a DPA provided
additional appropriate safeguards by ensuring that our partners are either committed to Privacy
Shield or that they have accepted the EU standard contractual clauses. We have signed DPA
with all of our processors..
Below you will find more information about how we use third-party partners in connection with
our services, including how we provide you with content, determine and/or improve our product
and services, perform analytics, and allow you to interact with social media platforms.
When you use our website
This section details the information we collect from you when you use our website to browse our
products and services and view the information we make available. Our legal basis for
processing and collecting your PII is based on consent or legitimate interests, as further detailed
below.
Cookies
We use cookies for several of our services and websites. Cookies are small pieces of text sent
by a website and stored on your computer by your web browser. A cookie file is stored in your
web browser and allows the service or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit
easier and the service more useful to you. Please refer to our ​cookie policy for detailed
information on which cookies we set when visiting our websites and using our services.
We use JSFiddle to display code demos and samples on our webpages and on our blog.
JSFiddle does not track personal information, but sets a session cookie to prevent cross-domain
attacks in the embedded code samples. Please refer to their terms of service and privacy policy
for additional information (​https://jsfiddle.net/terms/​)
Web beacons
Pages on our site and emails we send to our users may contain web beacons. Web beacons
(also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic file references
that are embedded onto a web page or an email to analyze traffic without collecting any
personal information, other than tracking, for example, whether a user has successfully opened
an email, visited a page or completed a purchase.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are
rendered invisibly on web pages when you open a page. The use of web beacons is based on
 Version 1.0.1                       Page 5 of 17


                                      Website Privacy Policy
legitimate interest because this is necessary to provide you the service, but when possible, we
will provide you with the option to opt out of such tracking.
Google reCAPTCHA
Based on our legitimate interest in the prevention of spam and abuse, we also use the
reCAPTCHA feature of Google on our websites. This function is primarily used to distinguish
whether an input is made by a natural person or abusive by automated processing. The service
includes the sending of the IP address and possibly other data required by Google for the
reCAPTCHA service to Google. Additional information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's
privacy policy can be found ​here​.
Bing Custom Search
Our API documentation utilizes Bing Custom Search in order to implement free text searching in
our documentation. Microsoft will use search data to improve Microsoft products and services.
For more information about the data collected by Microsoft, please refer to their ​Online Services
Terms​.
UTM codes
We may also make use of UTM codes. These are strings that are appended to a URL (the
“Uniform Resource Locator,” which is typically the http or https address entered to go to a web
page) when a user moves from one web page or website to another, where the string can
represent information about browsing, such as which promotion, page, or publisher sent the
user to the receiving website. UTM codes are used to enhance our web analytics solutions, but
only generates anonymized data, and is not used to identify the activity or identity of any one
person. UTM codes have no data collection purpose or effect if the user has not opted-in to web
tracking in the first place, therefore we will not collect any information from you without your
explicit consent.
Why do we collect this information?
Some services may not function properly without the use of cookies, but when possible, we will
allow you to use our products and services without the use of cookies or other tracking
mechanisms.
We use web analytics services called Google Analytics, Google Ads, Google Tag Manager and
Unbounce to record aggregated usage and performance data or website and web-services.
The primary reason for this is to understand our customers and improve our service and
offerings. We will not deny you access to our site or services should you decline the use of such
  Version 1.0.1                     Page 6 of 17


                                      Website Privacy Policy
tracking mechanisms, but when declined, there may be cases where the user experience is not
optimal.
What do we do with your information?
We collect anonymized data to record the date you visit the site, how often visitors come to this
site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to
this site, but no identifying information like e.g. the visitor’s detailed location. In the event you
have allowed such data to be collected, we may use portions or aggregated numbers for
marketing presentations or use Google Data Studio for visualizing trends, visitor numbers and
behavior. We do not link the information collected to any personally identifiable information in
our own or 3rd party databases.
We do not share or sell any information collected, even when anonymized.
Google provides some additional ​privacy options for Google Analytics cookies​.

The information we collect will be anonymized and kept for a maximum of 38 months. Google
provides some additional ​privacy terms​.

We may ask for your consent to retain your information in our systems in order to send you
further information that we think may be of interest to you.
How long do we keep your information for?
Your information is kept for as long as you continue to consent to receive our newsletter, but we
cease to send you updates and will remove your data from our records if you are inactive for
more than 2 years. Inactive, in this respect, means that you have not read any of the

the prompt deletion of any non-legal or financial information we have about you.
Additional rights as a data subject
In collecting this information, we are acting as a data controller and you have additional rights
with regards to the data we store and process on you, which are outlined in the section below
called ​Your rights as a data subject.
When you use our Export Server
The export server converts either a chart configuration (in JSON format) or a vectorized chart (in
SVG format) to one of several possible output formats (namely PNG/JPEG/SVG/PDF). This is
offered as a service to our customers in order to convert charts to e.g. print-ready formats.
When using the export server, either as an API service, or indirectly through the export module
in Highcharts/Highstock/Highmaps, your chart is sent to our server. This is the default behavior
of the export module. We also have an offline export module which operates without the need
for a web service, however this is not fully compatible with all browsers and formats.

                                        Website Privacy Policy
The export server itself is also fully open source, so you are free to host your own server should
your company policies require more control over the exporting process.
What do we do with your chart data?
We use the chart data in order to convert your chart to the desired output format. If you choose
to make use of this service for your own business purposes, your use of our products falls under
the premise of Legitimate Interest under Article 6-1(f) of the GDPR.
How long do we keep your data for?
When not using async exporting, the result from the chart export will be stored on our server for
15 minutes before it deletes itself. The file is publically available, as it must be for the service to
work, however the filenames are created using UUID’s and as such it is highly unlikely that
anyone would be able to guess the filenames within the lifespan of the files.

The privacy policy covers your personal data, but not the content you create, and you agree that
we are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of the converted charts resulting
