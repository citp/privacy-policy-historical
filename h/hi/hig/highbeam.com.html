			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

			<div class="lineDotted"></div>

			<p>At HighBeam™ Research, Inc. ("HighBeam") we want you, our users, to be aware of how we use information we have collected from and about you.  By coming to the HighBeam site, you are agreeing to and accepting

This means that we will use information we collect to learn how our audience uses the site, to create demographic profiles of our audience, to advertise effectively, and to communicate with you about matters relating to our services.</li>

			    <li>Similarly to most Internet companies, HighBeam contracts with several online partners to help manage (e,g., site traffic analytics) and provide functionality (e.g., email.).

You will have the option to opt out of receiving these messages in the "My Account" section of the website.</li>
			    <li>We also reserve the right to license your name, email address, postal address, and demographic information to other organizations that have specific product and service offers. You may choose at any time to remove your name and address from these third-party mailing lists by editing your privacy preferences on your My Account page, by filling out this form (please include your name, address, and email), or by opting out through the unsubscribe link on any email message you receive.

			    <li>We may use and/or distribute information about you and your use of the HighBeam site in forms that do not identify you individually or reveal your identity.</li>
			    <li>Advertisements, promotional offers, promotional emails, newsletters, "free gifts," and links, for example, on the HighBeam site or sent via email or other means from HighBeam may ask for Identifying Information from you.
