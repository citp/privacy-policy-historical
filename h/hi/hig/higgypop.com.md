Some of our website features allow you to invite a contact, such as a friend or family member to use the service. In order to provide this service, we will collect both your personal details and your contact's. We will use your name when we contact the person you have recommended, their personal data will only be used once and will not be saved or stored in any way.

We also collect anonymous data, which doesn't identify you as a person, via Google Analytics.

## Use Of Personal Data

We will always be transparent about how we plan to use your data so that you have the choice whether or not to give it to us.

If you give us consent and have opted to receive communications, then we may use your personal information to communicate with you about our services and promotions, or send you notifications of new content and features which may be of interest to you.

It is not our practice to contact you if you have made it clear that you do not wish to hear from us and you have the right to request that we cease sending communications. You can do this by clicking the unsubscribe link in the emails you receive from us, or by contacting privacy@higgypop.com.

We may also use this data as a testimonial. No identifying personal information, including full name or email address will ever be published as part of this content.

## Data Security

Your data will be stored securely on our server for a reasonable duration in order to smoothly serve content. This may be in the form of cache files, database entries or other server-side storage methods. Data submitted through contact forms will be deleted within 30 days of submission and postal addresses will be deleted once orders have been fulfilled.

Our servers are protected using HTTPS and SSL technology, so whilst your data is in our care we know it's as secure as it can be.

## Sharing Your Personal Data

Your data will not be sold, traded, rented or otherwise passed on to any third-parties, unless you have given us your explicit prior consent. However, we may disclose your personal information to a third-party in order to process your orders, or to arrange the prize fulfilment for competition winners.
