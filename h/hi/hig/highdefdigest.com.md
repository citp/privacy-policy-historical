_Email Submissions and Tips_. We require a user to enter a valid email address when the user submits a tip via our "[Tips and Submissions](https://web.archive.org/forms/tips/)" form. We also retain a copy of all emails sent to us from users of this site. While we will not sell or license the email addresses of our users to any third parties, we reserve the right to send our users occasional updates related to this site. 

We also require a user to enter valid email addresses when the user selects the "Email This Post" option with respect to any post.

_Forums_. We require a valid e-mail address for users who want to participate in our forums area. This allows us to protect our community from abusive postings and provides a verifiable point of contact should legal questions arise. At all times, you have the ability to keep your e-mail address hidden from other users by selecting that option within your user profile.

Also in the forum registration, you have the option of providing some additional information such as occupation, interests, and homepage URL. This information is made available publicly.
