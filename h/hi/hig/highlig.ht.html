<p>
Thanks for taking the time to read this.  We care deeply about protecting your privacy and are committed to making Highlight a product that people love and trust. This document outlines how we use and disclose the personally identifiable information (which we call "Personal Information") and other information that we collect.  If you have any questions that aren't answered here, please feel free to contact us anytime at <a href="mailto:privacy@highlig.ht">privacy@highlig.ht</a>.
</p>

<p>
In this Privacy Policy, we use the terms "Highlight", "we", "us" and "our" to refer to Math Camp, Inc. (the company that makes Highlight).  "Service" includes any websites or applications we operate, including this "Site" (www.highlig.ht) and the Highlight mobile app. "You" or "your" refers to users of our Service.
</p>

<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
<p>
When you use our Service we may collect Personal Information and other information from you, as described below:
</p>

<p>
<b>Personal Information.</b> We collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you create an account, add information to you user profile, or contact us with inquiries. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and agreeing that it may be transferred to the offices and servers of Highlight and the authorized third parties referred to herein, located in the United States. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Information.</b> When you use our Service, we also receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Highlight may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Highlight affiliates, agents or service providers. This Service may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Service, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. At times, Highlight also conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Highlight may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. Highlight may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>

<p>
In operating our Service, we may use a technology called "cookies" to help provide additional functionality and analyze Site usage more accurately. If you are interested, your Web browser should contain a Help section that explains how to receive notifications when you receive a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
</p>

<p>
<b>A Note About Location:</b> Our Service is designed to help you learn more about other people nearby, and we use your location information (e.g., by using the GPS on your mobile device) to provide the functionality of our Service.  If a person near you also uses our Service, their profile may be displayed on your mobile device - showing their name, profile photo(s), mutual friends, a snapshot of their approximate location, and anything else they have chosen to share.  Please keep in mind that other users can see this information about you, and they may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities outside of our control and without your knowledge. Your information may be subject to abuse, misuse, and monitoring by others, and you share this information at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
You may also choose to connect our Service to your other social network profiles, such as foursquare and Twitter. If you choose to connect any additional profiles, we may at times use your check-in data and your post information to identify your location.  If you do not wish to share information from foursquare and Twitter, you may disconnect these profiles at any time. 
</p>

<h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
<p>
We use the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use it:
</p><ul>
<li>to provide the core functionality of the Service (e.g., displaying your profile to people nearby);</li>
<li>to monitor your use of the Service and improve the user experience;</li>
<li>to respond to your comments and inquiries;</li>
<li>to communicate with you regarding the Service; and</li>
<li>for any other purpose for which the information was provided.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>What information do we share with third parties?</h2>
<p>
Highlight cares deeply about your privacy and, without your prior consent, we will not share your Personal Information except as outlined in our Privacy Policy. The following, however, are certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you: 
in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event;
with service providers we work with in connection with the operation of the Service, such as email or database providers;
with our corporate affiliates or subsidiaries for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy;
to enforce our Privacy Policy or other terms of service; and
if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend the rights or property of Highlight, protect the personal safety of users of the site or the public, or protect against legal liability.
</p>

<h2>Your control</h2>
<p>
You can use the Site without providing any Personal Information. If you choose not to provide any Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain parts of the Service. For example, to use the Highlight mobile application, you currently need to log in with your Facebook account.
</p>

<h2>Exclusions</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information collected by Highlight other than Personal Information collected through the Service. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Highlight through this Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Site, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions. All such information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Highlight shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit it without limitation or attribution.
</p>

<h2>Children's information</h2>
<p>
Highlight does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information on this Service. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Highlight through this Service, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
</p>

<h2>Links to other websites</h2>
<p>
This Service may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Highlight. The policies and procedures we describe here do not apply to these third party sites, nor do the links from this Service imply that Highlight endorses or has reviewed these third party sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies. 
</p>

<h2>Third party login</h2>
<p>
The Service requires you to sign in with your Facebook account to access logged in features.  When you log in using Facebook, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access Facebook, and Facebook will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to it.  We will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  However, please remember that the manner in which Facebook uses, stores and discloses your information is governed by its policies, and Highlight shall have no liability or responsibility for its privacy practices or other actions.  
</p>

<p>To help you quickly set up a profile, the Service imports some of your data from Facebook and adds it to your Highlight profile, including your job title, company, and your Facebook profile picture(s). These data may be visible to other Highlight users, regardless of whether those users are your friends on Facebook.  You can edit certain parts of your Highlight profile in the settings.</p>

<p>
You may at times have the option of posting your Highlight activities to other social networking service like Facebook or Twitter.  You acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any social networking services you have enabled will be able to view such activity.
</p>

<p>
You also acknowledge that other Highlight users may â€œhighlightâ€ you or mention you in their posts, notes, and/or encounter summaries, and that such mentions may be shared on Facebook.
</p>

<h2>Steps we take to protect your privacy</h2>
<p>
Highlight takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information provided via the Service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us in this way. 
</p>

<h2>Changes to Highlight's Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We may occasionally modify this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will let you know by changing the "last updated" date within this Privacy Policy, and your continued use of the Service shall indicate your agreement with the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>Again, if you have feedback, comments, or questions about this Privacy Policy you can contact us anytime at <a href="mailto:privacy@highlig.ht">privacy@highlig.ht</a>. To keep your Personal Information accurate, complete and current, please contact us, and we will take reasonable steps to update or correct the Personal Information in our possession that you have previously provided.</p>

<p>
