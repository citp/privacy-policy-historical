**Improvements**

We use the information regarding transactions (Date, Time, Email Address Used, Purchased Item Information and Payment Method Used) to process your transactions and to keep a log of what you have purchased in the past in case of any discrepancies you may have about what you have purchased. We also use this information to enable us to see what items sell well and improve on our best products and offerings.

**Communications**

We use your email address to validate and confirm that you are the account holder and so that you can click the opt in verification link to give your approval of us contacting you via email. This helps us keep you informed, send details of purchases for your records and also to verify the account holder for security reasons. We also promote other products and services (both supplied or provided by us or by third parties) to you via email but we do so from emails sent directly from our system only and do not share or distribute your email address with others. (See the "Linking to other websites" section below)

**Cookies and Tracking Technologies**
