We may refuse to exercise certain rights from those indicated above in a situation where the implementation of a given right would be in conflict with the legitimate purpose of the data we process. For example, we may refuse to delete personal data specified in your order until the expiry of the limitation period for claims under the concluded contract. We may contact you to ask you for further information to help you exercise your legal rights, or to speed up our response. We will try to respond to requests within one month and we will let you know if we need to take longer, for example because your request is complicated.

**Opt out of communications.**  You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your HighlightsFootball account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.

You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.

**Send “Do Not Track” Signals.**  Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.
