If you do not wish to receive these, please let us know by using the contact information above. If you are contacting us via email at [geninfo@cwf.org](mailto:geninfo@cwf.org), please label the email with the subject "OPT-OUT". Remember to provide us with your exact name and address so that we can remove your name from our list.

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13\. The only exception is our electronic field trip forum for registered schools where e-mail addresses are collected to verify registration.
