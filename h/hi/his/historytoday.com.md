# History Today: The educational archive of articles, news and study aids for teachers, students and enthusiasts - Privacy Policy

**General**

Thank you for visiting historytoday.com.

Your privacy is important to us. We provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

History Today Ltd owns and operates historytoday.com. All the information you give will be treated as confidential and is stored in a secure server, with only authorised individuals approved by History Today Ltd having access.

 **Collection and use of your details**

The types of information that may be collected via the registration and purchase transactions include: name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card information. This information will be used in transaction processes, to fulfil any other requests for our products, programs and services, and used to update you on any important changes to the website and its functionality. We will also use this information to inform you of other products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to be contacted for this purpose, please express your preferences on the registration page.

To enable History Today to improve our service to you we may ask for additional details with regard to competitions, other features and offers, and online surveys.

 **Change My Profile**

To change any of your details please log-on to the website and click on _Edit Profile_.

 **Purchase transaction details**

To complete purchase transactions History Today will use credit or debit card details, and billing or delivery address information provided by you. SSL (Secure Socket Layer), encrypts all ordering information so that no part of your order - including your name, address, and credit card number - can be read by a third party. Consequently, your credit card number is safer when you order online through SSL than when you make a credit card purchase in a restaurant or a store! 

All payment details are stored by WorldPay systems. The banking authorities, to ensure a secure transaction environment, regularly audit data storage on WorldPay systems, and the communication between WorldPay and the worldwide banking networks.
