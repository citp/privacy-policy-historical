## 2\. What is Personal Data?

Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as “any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier”.

Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.

The personal data that we use is set out in Part 4, below.

## 3\. What Are My Rights?

Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:

  * a) The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Notice should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using the details in Part 9.
  * b) The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 9 will tell you how to do this.
  * c) The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by us is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact us using the details in Part 9 to find out more.

  * e) The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.
  * f) The right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.
