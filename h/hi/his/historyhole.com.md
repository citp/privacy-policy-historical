By your use of the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, display, disclosure, and other uses of your information to third party individuals or organizations.

We collect the following types of information from our users.

**IP Address Information and Cookies**

We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookies (“Identifying Information”). This Identifying Information is used for several purposes such as determining how frequently you and other individuals visit the Site, protecting the Site from malicious activity, and collecting data related to your interaction with the Services.

To support and enhance the Services, we may provide advertisements, as well as allow third parties advertisements on our Site. These advertisements may be targeted and or may come from third party advertisement companies.  
When your web browser requests these advertisements from the third party advertisement company’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or send you their own cookies, just as if you had clicked on a website link directly from their site. By using History Hole’s services, you consent to any cookies being placed onto your web browser either by History Hole, or by any third party advertisement company.
