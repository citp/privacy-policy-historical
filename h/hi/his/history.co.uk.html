We have developed this privacy policy because we want you to be confident that your privacy is protected and the personal information you may provide us is secure. A+E is governed by the data protection laws of the United Kingdom. When we refer to "personal information" in this privacy policy, we mean information, which identifies you as an individual, or is capable of doing so, which may include any sensitive personal data. Please see Part I (Information Collection) below.</p> <p><strong><em>Please read this privacy policy carefully</em></strong>. If you are visiting any of our websites you indicate your agreement to our use of your personal information as set out in this privacy policy. This statement applies solely to information collected by A+E when you use any A+E Services. Our websites may contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies. A+E does not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites.<br> <br> <strong>Part I. Information Collection and Use</strong><br> When you sign up to participate in or receive any A+E Services, such as newsletters, competitions, live chats, message boards we may ask for personal information about you, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone, mobile number or date of birth. Different services or webpages may ask for different and/or additional personal information.<br> By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable A+E to provide you with the services you select.<br> Sometimes on particular A+E Services (e.g. chat forums) you may volunteer additional personal information. This information may be sensitive personal information (e.g. your political opinions or criminal offences or health). It is your responsibility to safeguard your privacy when disclosing such information on such forums.<br> A+E may use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following:<br> •	for service administration purposes;<br> •	to notify you of changes to our service;<br> •	to measure interest in and use of the various areas of A+E service, including by means of hits on a webpage or online advertisement, and to share such information with advertisers;<br> •	to contact you about a submission you have made to our services including our websites;<br> •	to personalise or improve the way A+E content and advertising is presented to you online including use of your IP address and to place cookies for some of our website services (please see our Cookies section below).<br> •	to manage our competitions and contact the winners and/or contestants;<br> •	where you have specifically consented to be contacted for these purposes, to send you direct marketing by telephone, post or email about A+E updates and programme launches;<br> •	to enable other people or businesses to carry out work on our behalf; and<br> •	where you have given us your permission, to pass your information to organisations to allow them to contact you of offers, products and services that may be of interest to you.<br> •	Where A+E proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will request your consent.</p> <p><strong>Part 2. Cookies</strong><br> You should be aware that when you use our websites, mobile sites, or mobile apps, we may collect information by using 'cookies'. In this notice a cookie is any technology or method we use to store and read information on your machine.<br> What are cookies and how do they work?<br> Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you and can then tailor what you see on the screen. You can find out more about cookies at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a><br> <br> <strong>What do you use cookies for?</strong><br> Cookies are an important part of the internet. They make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked for</strong><br> Some cookies are essential so you can move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you’d like to use can't be provided, like viewing video for example. These cookies don't gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.</p> <p><strong>Improving your browsing experience</strong><br> These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region and they provide improved features.</p> <p>Here are a few examples of just some of the ways that cookies are used to improve your experience on our websites:<br> •	Remembering your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences.<br> •	Remembering if you've filled in a survey, so you're not asked to do it again.<br> •	Remembering if you've been to the site before. If you are a first-time user, you might see different content to a regular user.<br> •	Restricting the number of times you're shown a particular advertisement. This is sometimes called 'frequency capping'.<br> •	Enabling social media components, like Facebook or Twitter.<br> •	Showing 'related article' links that are relevant to the page you're looking at.</p> <p><strong>Analytics</strong><br> We like to keep track of which pages and links are popular and which ones don't get used as much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our sites and if they get 'error messages' from web pages. This information helps us to make our sites as user friendly as we can.</p> <p>This group of cookies, often called 'analytics cookies' are used to gather this information. These cookies don't collect information that identifies you. The information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity. Analytics cookies only record activity on the site you are on and they are only used to improve how a website works.</p> <p>Some of our websites and some of the emails you might get from us also contain small invisible images known as 'web beacons' or 'tracking pixels'. These are used to count the number of times the page or email has been viewed and allows us to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and emails. These web beacons are anonymous and don't contain or collect any information that identifies you.</p> <p>We also use 'affiliate' cookies. Some of our web pages will contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is sometimes used to tell that other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. This works using a cookie.</p> <p><strong>Showing advertising that is relevant to your interests</strong><br> We sell space on some of our sites to advertisers. The resulting adverts often contain cookies. The advertiser uses the browsing information collected from these cookies to:&nbsp;<br> •	restrict the number of times you see the same ad (frequency capping)<br> •	help show other ads that are relevant to you while you're on our websites.&nbsp;<br> This is often called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies, to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests. The OBA data collected from cookies you get when you're on our sites is only used to show relevant ads on our sites, not on other websites.</p> <p>So how does OBA work? Let's look at an example. Imagine you visit a website about travel. That website shows an advert and with that advert you receive a cookie. Imagine you then visit one of our websites which has an advert from the same advertiser you saw on the travel site. The advertiser will give you a new version of the cookie you received on the travel site. The advertiser can then use that cookie to recognise that you've previously been to a travel site and show you a relevant ad.</p> <p>Although the OBA data collected uses your browsing activity to understand your interests, the data is anonymous and isn’t linked to you as a person. You can find out more about OBA and cookies at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.com</a></p> <p><strong>Managing Cookies</strong><br> You can control which cookies are placed on your computer by accessing our privacy manager by clicking on the Cookie Consent button at the bottom of your screen.</p> <p><strong>Part 3. Storage, Access and Deletion of Information</strong><br> Where you contribute to any A+E Services, A+E will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.<br> You may request a copy of the personal information A+E holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. We may charge £10.00 for information requests and will require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved photographic identification.&nbsp;<br> You may request that your information be deleted from our database by e-mailing us at privacy@aetn.co.uk.<br> Once you have notified us, we will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files.<br> If you have any requests or questions about this or any other question about this Privacy Policy please see Part 7: How to contact A+E.<br> <strong><br> Part 4. Non-disclosure to third parties</strong><br> Unless we have your express consent, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties or use the information in any other way without your prior consent.<br> We will only use your information as set out in this policy and will not sell, rent or pass your information on to others for marketing purposes.<br> <br> <strong>Part 5. Unsubscribe / Preferences</strong><br> You can unsubscribe from email communications at any time by clicking on the UNSUBSCRIBE link, which can be found in all electronic communication</p> <p>You can also contact A+E by writing to us at the address below.&nbsp;<br> <strong><br> Part 6. Updates</strong><br> We regularly review our privacy policy and will update it from time to time. We suggest you check it each time you submit personal information to any A+E Service</p> <p><strong>Part 7.
