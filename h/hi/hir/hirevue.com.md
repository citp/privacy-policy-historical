# HireVue Privacy Policy | HireVue

HireVue is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your candidates and employees. It is a HireVue policy that company and personal information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail, and evaluation results remain private and confidential. We do not sell or rent your company or personal information to others. We use customer information only for the purposes of setting up your account, delivering our service, enhancing the operation of our site, and administering our systems. We may use third parties in some instances to offer technical support. In such cases, we only give them access to the information needed to do their job, and we require that they abide by the HireVue privacy policy.

### Personal Information

Our business customers request their job candidates complete a HireVue Interview which can include information such as work history, measurements of knowledge, skills, abilities, work style and other responses to questions. Only the customer, authorized employees of HireVue, Inc. and authorized designees of the customer have access to this information.

HireVue believes in protecting your privacy. When we collect personal information from you on our website, we comply with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from the European Union and Switzerland. These are our promises to you:

  1. **Notice**. When we collect your personal information, we’ll give you timely and appropriate notice describing what personal information we’re collecting, how we’ll use it, and the types of third parties with whom we may share it. 
  2. **Choice**. We’ll give you choices about the ways we use and share your personal information, and we’ll respect the choices you make. 
  3. **Relevance**. We’ll collect only as much personal information as we need for specific, identified purposes, and we won’t use it for other purposes without obtaining your consent. 
  4. **Retention**. We’ll keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the purposes for which we collected it, or as permitted by law. 
  5. **Accuracy**. We’ll take appropriate steps to make sure the personal information in our records is accurate.
  6. **Access**. We’ll provide ways for you to access your personal information, as required by law, so you can correct inaccuracies.
  7. **Security**. We’ll take appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
  8. **Sharing**. Except as described in this policy, we won’t share your personal information with third parties without your consent.
