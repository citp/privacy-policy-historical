### Site Navigational Information

As you navigate Hireology’s Web Site, Hireology may also collect information through the use of commonly used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons. Such information includes standard information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), IP address, and the actions you take on the Site (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked). This section describes the types of Site Navigational Information Hireology may collect and how Hireology may use this information.

* * *

### Cookies

Hireology uses cookies to make interactions with Hireology’s Site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Site, Hireology’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Hireology, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, filling out a web form, or otherwise contacting us, you remain anonymous to Hireology.

There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.

If you have chosen to identify yourself to Hireology, Hireology uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow Hireology to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed in your browser. These session cookies allow Hireology to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.

Hireology uses persistent cookies that only Hireology can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Site. When you purchase the Services or provide Hireology with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned to you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that Hireology places on your web browser. Hireology is careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, Hireology does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate Hireology’s Web Site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.

Hireology may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with User Data to provide you with information about Hireology and the Services.

Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, Hireology may place web beacons in marketing e-mails that notify Hireology when you click on a link in the e-mail that directs you to the Site. Hireology uses web beacons to operate and improve Hireology’s Site and e-mail communications. Hireology may use information from web beacons in combination with User Data to provide you with information about Hireology and the Services.
