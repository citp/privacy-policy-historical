                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                
		        <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    The HirePulse.com.au website is owned by CareerPulse Pty Ltd (hereafter “CareerPulse”).  CareerPulse recognises the importance of protecting the privacy 
    of personally identifiable information collected about our customers.  For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the term “customers” includes visitors 
    to our website, subscribers and their team members, and users of our services and purchasers of our products. We are bound by the National Privacy Principles 
    in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) in relation to the handling of personal information. Where appropriate we will handle personal information relying on the media 
    exemption (but complying with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards), related bodies corporate exemption and the employee exemption in the Privacy Act.
</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    We collect personal information when we provide our services to you. Generally we will tell you why we are collecting information when we collect it and how 
    we plan to use it or these things will be obvious when we collect the information. We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes 
    we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also acquire lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of team members, we typically obtain your personal information from our subscriber with whom you are associated and we operate on the assumption that 
    you have authorised such disclosure.
</p>

<h2>Storage of Information</h2>
<p>By registering for and using our services you understand that CareerPulse may collect and hold personal information provided about you or your team members indefinitely.</p>

<h2>Collection and Use of information</h2>
<p>
    When you register for our services, we will collect your email and password information and then, following registration but prior to any advertisement, you 
    will provide us with your:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Business name and ABN/ACN;</li>
    <li>Contact details, including street and postal address, e-mail address, website URL, and phone and fax numbers; and</li>
    <li>A description of your business.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    If you register a team member, we also request the following information from you regarding that team member, not all of which must be mandatorily provided:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Title;</li>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Area(s) Serviced;</li>
    <li>Professions Skills; and</li>
    <li>Industry Experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    When you register information about your team members we rely on you to inform those individuals that you are providing their personal information to 
    CareerPulse and that you have their written consent to do so.
</p>
<p>
    When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network which you visit and what you click on. As a general rule we do not collect 
    sensitive information. However, if we do, it will usually be for the purposes of providing our products or services and if the law requires us to, we will 
    seek your consent to collect it.
</p>
<p>
    We use your information to provide Services to you including advertising on our Site, to fulfil administrative functions associated with these products and 
    services, for example billing, to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes. We may share your 
    information with other companies which are related to CareerPulse Pty Ltd or other businesses run by CareerPulse Pty Ltd. We or they may also use your 
    personally identifiable information to assist us in improving our products and services and any of us might be in touch to let you know about goods, services, 
    or promotions which may interest you.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not provide accurate personal information as requested by CareerPulse, you understand that CareerPulse may not be able to provide you with one or 
    more products or services, or the same level of service it intends to provide to, or provides, to others.
</p>
<p>
    Except where otherwise indicated in this document, if CareerPulse intends to use your personal information for any other purpose not listed in this document, 
    CareerPulse will seek your consent before doing so.
</p>
<p>
    CareerPulse takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date. 
    However, the accuracy of this information depends to a large extent on the information you provide in your account and content. This is why we recommend that 
    you keep your information up to date; and that you contact us with any issues if they arise.
</p>

<h2>Use by Third Parties</h2>
<p>
    CareerPulse may disclose your information to its service providers and contractors from time to time to help us to provide and market our products and 
    services to you. 
</p>
<p>
    We may also disclose your personal information to other parties, such as our technical service providers, credit agencies, professional advisors, debt 
    collectors, accountants, auditors, lawyers, insurers and government and regulating agencies as and when required without first contacting you.  Furthermore, 
    we may disclose such personal information to your professional advisors and/or representatives when requested in writing by you to do so.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we are not responsible for the use that any third party may make of personal information we have provided to them in good faith and in 
    accordance with this policy.
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>
    <strong>It is important that all information and documentation submitted by the subscriber to CareerPulse, including that incorporated as part of uploaded 
    files, is checked by the subscriber to ensure its accuracy prior to submission.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Use of Aggregate Data</h2>
<p>
    We may collect certain non-personal information to optimise our products and services, including our webpages 
    for your computer (e.g., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP 
    address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for 
    internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our sites and assisting with the 
    diagnosis of problems or support issues associated with our supply of the products or services. 
</p>
<p>
    CareerPulse may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our goods and services 
    including our webpages and make them more responsive to the needs of our customers. This statistical compilation 
    and analysis of information may also be used by CareerPulse or provided to others as a summary report for 
    marketing, advertising or research purposes.
</p>

<h2>Security and Storage of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    CareerPulse strives to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information of our 
    customers. We use a variety of physical and electronic security measures including restricting physical access 
    to our offices and firewalls and secure databases to keep personal information secure from misuse, loss or 
    unauthorised use or disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 
    totally secure and you accept this inherent risk. Accordingly, CareerPulse is not responsible for any event 
    arising from unauthorised access of your personal information.
</p>
<p>
    It is your responsibility for implementing sufficient procedures and checks to satisfy the security of your 
    computers and data from viruses, Trojans, hackers and other forms of unauthorised access by any person or 
    program.
</p>
<p>
    If at any time you believe that the integrity of your account with CareerPulse has been breached, please 
    contact support@hirepulse.com.au. 
</p>
<p>
    From time to time, CareerPulse may also engage the services of third party providers to host the website and 
    its associated personal information.  When this occurs, CareerPulse shall endeavour to ensure that the third 
    party provider operates in accordance with this policy and Australia’s National Privacy Principles.
</p>

<h2>Access to Personal Information - General</h2>
<p>
    You have a right to access most personal information we hold about you and if we deny access in some 
    circumstances we will tell you why. To request access, please contact our privacy officer as set out at the 
    end of this document. 
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we may only be able to provide you with current details of personal information we hold 
    about you.  We are not able to guarantee that we can provide you with details of personal information held 
    about you at a particular point in time.
</p>

<h2>Access to Personal Information - Team Members</h2>
<p>
    If you are listed as a team member for a subscriber and you believe that your personal information has been 
    incorrectly stated in the subscriber’s advertisement, it is your responsibility to request that the subscriber 
    amend the incorrect details and to follow the matter up with them if not corrected.  
</p>
<p>
    In the event that you continue to be listed as a team member for a subscriber with whom you are no longer 
    associated, you should advise CareerPulse of the change.  Hire Pulse will then contact the subscriber concerned 
    and advise them that they have seven (7) days to contest the matter or the team member’s details will no longer 
    be displayed as part of their advertisement.  If they contest the matter, we will contact you to advise that the 
    matter has been contested.  It is then your responsibility to contact the subscriber and settle the matter on 
    terms that require the advertiser to amend their advertisement to remove or modify your listing as a team member 
    of the subscriber.
</p>

<h2>Public Information</h2>
<p>
    CareerPulse provides advertising to the general public.  As such, subscribers and their team members should be 
    aware that the information provided in their advertisements will become public information.  While it is against 
    the Terms and Conditions of Use of the CareerPulse website, CareerPulse cannot guarantee that third parties may 
    seek to use advertised information you have provided for any purpose other than for seeking to purchase your 
    advertised services or products.
</p>
<p>
    Any information posted on bulletin boards, communicated in chat areas and/or otherwise provided for use in any 
    public area of the CareerPulse website becomes public information. While CareerPulse strives to protect and 
    respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in a chat room or 
    bulletin board. 
</p>
<p>
    CareerPulse may seek to confirm personal information you provide through other publicly available sources, such 
    as ASIC’s company and business name registers and the ATMOSS Australian on-line trade mark register.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
    Cookies are data that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies 
    can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and to 
    compile data that can help us improve our content and target advertising. If you do not want information 
    collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or 
    accept the Cookie feature. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You should note, however, that Cookies are necessary to provide you with access to your account as well as 
    certain features or services such as site preferences.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    CareerPulse may also employ programs having similar functionality to Cookies to assist you in using the website 
    or in us providing our services to you.
</p>

<h2>Online Links to Third Parties and Co-Branded Sites</h2>
<p>
    CareerPulse may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to our Internet sites to link 
    directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with our logo; however, 
    these sites may not be operated or maintained by or on our behalf. These sites may collect personal information 
    from you that may be shared with us. This Privacy Statement will apply to any personal information so shared. 
</p>
<p>
    CareerPulse is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are 
    linked to our sites. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not 
    constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by CareerPulse of the content, policies or practices of those 
    third party sites. Once you have left our site via such a link, you should become familiar with the applicable 
    privacy policy of the third party site. 
</p>

<h2>Disclosures to Law Enforcement and Regulating Agencies</h2>
<p>
    Where CareerPulse receives a request for personal information about one or more of our customers from a law 
    enforcement or regulating agency, and CareerPulse has taken advice that the request is legally valid and 
    enforceable, CareerPulse shall disclose that information to the law enforcement or regulating agency without 
    seeking your prior approval.  Where this occurs, unless the request otherwise prohibits it, CareerPulse will 
    contact you as soon as practicable to inform you about the request, the law enforcement or regulating agency 
    who made the request and the personal information provided in response to the request.
</p>

<h2>Communication With You</h2>
<p>
    CareerPulse uses personally identifiable information for essential communications, such as e-mails, account 
    information and critical service details.  However, CareerPulse will never ask you for your password via 
    e-mail or SMS and will always identify itself in each message.
</p>
<p>
    Where CareerPulse changes its method of communicating with you, you will be advised of the reason for the 
    change and the new method of communication through the website.
</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
    CareerPulse’s services are not intended for children.  CareerPulse will not knowingly seek personal information 
    from any child under the age of sixteen (16).
</p>
<p>
    If a business or company is owned by a person under the age of eighteen (18), the business or company should 
    first contact CareerPulse before becoming a subscriber of CareerPulse.  Similarly, if a business or company 
    wishes to advertise the services of a team member under the age of eighteen (18), the business or company 
    should also first contact CareerPulse before becoming a subscriber of CareerPulse.  In this manner, CareerPulse 
    and the business or company can work together to ensure that the personal information of the minor is protected 
    as best possible and all other legalities involving are covered.
</p>

<h2>Transborder Use of Information</h2>
<p>
    The international nature of some of CareerPulse’s services may require CareerPulse to transfer personal 
    information to people outside of Australia.  By using such services, you consent to such transfers.  
</p>
<p>
    CareerPulse will use its best efforts to comply with any law relating to the protection of personal information 
    applicable to any international transfer of personal information.  Where there is no law, or the law concerned 
    does not provide the same level of protection to personal information as Australia’s National Privacy Principles, 
    CareerPulse shall ensure that the international transfer of personal information and subsequent use thereof by the 
    recipient is governed by Australia’s National Privacy Principles.
</p>

<h2>Other Things You Should Know About Privacy on the Internet</h2>
<p>
    Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot 
    access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a 
    computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. You as an individual are responsible for the 
    security of and access to your own computer. 
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any 
    account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet.
</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
    From time to time, CareerPulse may vary this privacy policy.  Such variations may, for example, be made to 
    keep them in line with updates to its business, to comply with legislative changes or for security or 
    technical reasons.  Your continued use of the website after such variations come into effect is deemed 
    acceptance of the new privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>
    CareerPulse welcomes feedback of any sort on its site and services that our subscribers or visitors send to us.  
    This information helps us to administer and improve our services and may be shared with others.  Please direct 
    any feedback to feedback@HirePulse.com.au.

        <h1>What is it?</h1>
        <p>The HirePulse chat program makes communication between clients and service providers easy. It allows people to conduct conversations in
        real-time through the HirePulse site with instant messaging.</p>
        
        <h1>How do I use it?</h1>
        <p>When you navigate to a business's advertisement on this website, you'll see a chat icon in the Contact Details section indicating whether 
        that business is currently online or offline. If a business is online and you are signed in to the service, all you need to do is click "Chat live"
        to begin a live chat with that service provider.</p>
        
        <h1>How do I get started?</h1>
        <p>To use the service you must be signed in.  If you have a business advertisement and are logged in to the site, you're already signed in to the
        HirePulse chat service. If you are a client looking for service providers, you need to supply your name so that businesses can identify you.
