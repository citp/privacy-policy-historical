##  Information We Collect and Use

Parts of our site invite you to register for events, product evaluations, or to obtain more information on our products and services. The information you provide will remain ImageTrend’s property and will not be sold or rented to a third party. We may use your contact information to send you company and product information that you requested and for marketing analysis of our website traffic and advertising effectiveness. We may also share your voluntarily provided information with our business partners for related products or integrations, or with event sponsors of a specific event for which you are registered.

In addition to the personal information that you may provide us, this site may use technology that lets us collect certain technical information like your Internet protocol address, your computer’s operating system, your browser type, traffic patterns and the address of any referring websites. ImageTrend monitors how a visitor arrives at the website, but cannot and will not gather information about other sites the visitor has been on.

It is ImageTrend’s practice to easily allow you to remove your name from our distribution list by clicking on a link provided within each electronic communication, or to send an email to support@ImageTrend.com with the subject line “unsubscribe”.

##  Cookies

A _cookie_ is a piece of data assigned by a Web server to the browser on your computer. Cookies help websites recognize return visitors. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow our system to automatically fill in your contact information into a registration form with information that was received from you on a previous visit. Cookies also allow us to identify you. By showing how and when our visitors use this site, this information can help us to continue to improve our site. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your Web browser to do so, if your browser so permits. If a visitor refuses cookies then ImageTrend does not gather any information on that visitor.

##  Other Sites and Business Partners

ImageTrend provides links on our site that take you to other websites such as our partner websites and media sites when ImageTrend is covered or featured in the articles. ImageTrend has no control over the content of these other sites, nor the usage of information they gather. We encourage you to review privacy and other policies at third party sites you visit, since those sites are not bound to follow our policies.

##  Modifications

ImageTrend may in the future alter or add to this Privacy Policy, especially as we add new services to our site. Accordingly, please check this part of our site from time to time to see if there has been a change.
