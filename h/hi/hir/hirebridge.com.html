      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Hirebridge is committed to respecting 
      your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and 
      management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal 
      Information") you share with us. </p>
      <p>Hirebridge has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can 
      understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal 
      Information. </p>
      <p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify 
      an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a 
      home or other physical address and an email address or other contact 
      information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit 
      Hirebridge's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any 
      Personal Information about yourself. </p>
      <p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, 
      we may transfer that Information within Hirebridge or to Hirebridge's 
      third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or 
      jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. </p>
      <p>Hirebridge strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe 
      that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may 
      vary from country to Hirebridge Hirebridge intends to adhere to the 
      principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection 
      with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to 
      countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your 
      Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection 
      for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is 
      collected, transferred, or retained. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<br></strong>Some of our 
      Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is 
      a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information 
      about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to 
      recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most 
      browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept 
      them and how to remove them. </p>
      <p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you 
      may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you 
      choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your 
      original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web 
      site. </p>
      <p>Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain 
      and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and 
      operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our 
      site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies 
      allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also 
      analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends 
      and statistics.</p>
      <p><br><strong>Notice</strong><br>Where Hirebridge collects Personal 
      Information on the web, we intend to post a purpose statement that 
      explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether we plan to 
      share such Personal Information outside of Hirebridge or those working on 
      Hirebridge's behalf. Hirebridge does not intend to transfer Personal 
      Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act 
      on Hirebridge behalf unless such transfer is legally required. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Choice</strong><br>You may choose whether or not to provide 
      Personal Information to Hirebridge. The notice we intend to provide where 
      Hirebridge collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to 
      make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we 
      request, you can still visit most of Hirebridge Web sites, but you may be 
      unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our 
      interaction with you. </p>
      <p>If you chose to have a relationship with Hirebridge such as a 
      contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will 
      naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business 
      relationship. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Security</strong><br>Wherever your Personal Information may be 
      held within Hirebridge or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and 
      appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with 
      us from unauthorized access or disclosure. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Access/Accuracy<br></strong>To the extent that you do provide 
      us with Personal Information, Hirebridge wishes to maintain accurate 
      Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on 
      the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting Hirebridge should 
      you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those 
      means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and 
      corrections about your Personal Information to <a href="mailto:privacy@Hirebridge.com">privacy@Hirebridge.com</a> and we 
      will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal 
      Information that we hold as soon as practicable. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Third Party Services<br></strong>Third parties provide certain services available on 
      Hirebridge.com on Hirebridge's behalf. Hirebridge may provide information, 
      including Personal Information, that Hirebridge collects on the Web to 
      third-party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, 
      information, and services. Service providers are also an important means 
      by which Hirebridge maintains its Web site and mailing lists. Hirebridge 
      will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service 
      providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on Hirebridge's 
      behalf. </p>
      <p>Hirebridge does not intend to transfer Personal Information without 
      your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Hirebridge's 
      behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against 
      Hirebridge's policy to sell Personal Information collected online without 
      consent. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Children's Privacy<br></strong>Hirebridge.com is not 
      structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect 
      Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Commitment</strong><br>We are committed to privacy and, through 
      our membership in the Online Privacy Alliance, are actively involved in 
      and support current industry initiatives to preserve individual privacy 
      rights on the Internet. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving 
      area, and Hirebridge's Web sites are constantly evolving to meet these 
      demands. </p>
      <p>If you have any comments or questions regarding our Online Privacy 
      Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Hirebridge.com">privacy@Hirebridge.com</a>. While we 
      cannot guarantee privacy perfection, we will address any issue to the best 
      of our abilities as soon as possible. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Your Consent<br></strong>By using this Web site, you consent to the terms of our 
      Online Privacy Policy and to Hirebridge's processing of Personal 
      Information for the purposes given above as well as those explained where 
      Hirebridge collects Personal Information on the Web. Should the Online 
      Privacy Policy change, we intend to take every reasonable step to ensure 
      that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes 
      prominently on our web site for a reasonable period of 
  time.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
