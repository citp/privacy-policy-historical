              recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any 
              personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you 
            share with us.&nbsp;</b></p>
            <p> Personal Information means any information that may be used to 
            identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and 
            last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or 
            other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, 
            you can visit Hirebridge's Web pages without telling us who you are 
            or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. </p>
            <p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information to us 
			via our website, we may transfer that Information within Hirebridge or to 
            Hirebridge's third-party service providers, across borders, and from 
            your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions 
            around the world.            </p>
            <p><b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<br>
			</b>Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking 
            technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for 
            example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some 
            cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal 
            Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow 
            you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and 
            how to remove them. <br>
            You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or 
            you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note 
            that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to 
            re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to 
            certain parts of the Web site. Tracking technologies may record 
            information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet 
            protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system 
            types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is 
            accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows 
            us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also 
            analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for 
      trends and statistics.</p>
            <p><b>Notice<br>
			</b>Where Hirebridge collects Personal Information on via our 
			website, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why 
			Personal Information will be collected. Hirebridge does not intend to transfer Personal 
            Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound 
            to act on Hirebridge behalf unless such transfer is legally 
            required. </p>
            <p><b>Choice<br>
			</b>You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to 
            Hirebridge. The notice we intend to provide where Hirebridge 
            collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make 
            this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information 
            we request, you can still visit most of Hirebridge Web sites, but 
            you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services 
            that involve our interaction with you. If you chose to have a relationship with Hirebridge such as a 
            contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will 
            naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business 
            relationship. </p>
            <p><b>Security<br>
			</b>Wherever your Personal Information may be held within Hirebridge 
            or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps 
            to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from 
            unauthorized access or disclosure. </p>
            <p><b>Access/Accuracy<br>
			</b>To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, 
            Hirebridge wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where 
            we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to 
            provide a means of contacting Hirebridge should you need to update 
            or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are 
            unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections 
            about your Personal Information to 
			<a href="mailto:privacy@Hirebridge.com">privacy@Hirebridge.com </a>and we 
            will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your 
            Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable. </p>
            <p><b>Third Party Services<br>
			</b>Third parties provide certain services available on 
            Hirebridge.com on Hirebridge's behalf. Hirebridge may provide 
            information, including Personal Information, that Hirebridge 
            collects on the Web to third-party service providers to help us 
            deliver programs, products, information, and services. Service 
            providers are also an important means by which Hirebridge maintains 
            its Web site and mailing lists. Hirebridge will take reasonable 
            steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are 
            obligated to protect Personal Information on Hirebridge's behalf.

            without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on 
            Hirebridge's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. 
            Similarly, it is against Hirebridge's policy to sell Personal 
            Information collected online without consent. </p>
            <p><b>Children's Privacy<br>
			</b>Hirebridge.com is not structured to attract children. 
            Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from 
            anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. </p>
            <p><b>Questions and Comments<br>
			</b>We are committed to maintaining your privacy. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, 
            and Hirebridge's Web sites are constantly evolving to meet these 
            demands.
