**Submitting a Request**

Where applicable law allows for such a right, if you would like to request to access, correct, object to the use, restrict or delete Personal Information that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may submit a request through the MINDBODY Services themselves or contact us at [privacy@mindbodyonline.com](mailto:privacy@mindbodyonline.com) with a subject line "Data Subject Request". We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

If you are an End User you may, depending on the MINDBODY Service utilized, be able to access, correct or request deletion of Personal Information that you have previously provided to us through your online customer account. These Data Subject Requests and other rights, including objection, restriction and portability (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), can also be made directly to the relevant Subscriber.

For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. Where applicable law allows for an authorized agent to submit such a request, please contact us at [privacy@mindbodyonline.com](mailto:privacy@mindbodyonline.com) with a subject line "Data Subject Request – Agent Request" and someone will be in touch with the agent and the End User to verify the request.

Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information if doing so infringes on the rights of another user.

If you are an End User of one of our Subscribers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Subscribers, or would like request the exercise of a right as set out above in relation to Personal Information held by a Subscriber, please contact the Subscriber directly.

If you have provided your information to MINDBODY, and opt-out, MINDBODY will put in place processes to honor your request. This may entail keeping some information for the purpose of remembering that you have opted-out.
  * **Consent to sharing of your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their (or their customers’) direct marketing purposes:** We only share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third-parties for their marketing purposes when you have consented to the sharing. We do not share data with unaffiliated third-parties in the absence of your consent and such consent will only be valid for a single data transfer. To address what these unaffiliated third-parties do with your data once you have consented to the sharing, please contact the third-party to learn more about your choices.



We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you messages for administrative, transactional or other purposes directly relating to your use of the MINDBODY Services, and you cannot opt-out from receiving those messages.

Our mobile applications may also send push notifications to your mobile device, provided you consented to this. If you have previously consented to receiving push notifications and no longer wish to receive them, you can also turn push notifications off at the device level. The applications may also request access to your device’s calendar application, storage, Bluetooth, camera, and microphone. If you have previously allowed access to your device’s calendar and no longer wish to allow access, you may edit the application settings at the device level.

We, our service providers and partners may collect Other Information and certain Personal Information in a variety of ways.

Where a third-party payment processor is utilized as a sub-processor, we have implemented appropriate onward transfer safeguards over your Personal Information. See Section 23 for a list of sub-processors and their applicable privacy policies.

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including our Subscribers and any third party operating any Third Party Offering, site or other products and services used in connection with the MINDBODY Services.

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

  * The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the MINDBODY Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the MINDBODY Services);
  * Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
  * Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).



The security of Personal Information is a high priority at MINDBODY. We seek to use reasonable technical, administrative and physical safeguards designed to protect Personal Information within our organization.

MINDBODY complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, MINDBODY is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
