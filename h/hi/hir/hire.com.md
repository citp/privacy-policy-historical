We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

**Disclosure**

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.

We may disclose personal information including information collected for our clients, as necessary or appropriate in connection with any of the purposes for which we use personal information, including to subcontractors or service providers that help host or support the sites or otherwise provide technical assistance, fulfillment companies that help us to provide requested products or services and business partners that help conduct seminars or otherwise provide requested products, services or information. We may use third party service providers to provide credit card processing on our site. We will share your credit card information as necessary for the third party to provide such processing services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our clients. We reserve the right to disclose personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In situations where we transfer personal information to these types of third parties, we require that such third parties must not use or disclose the information for any purposes other than those specified in this Privacy Policy, and that such third parties must maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the personal information. In situations involving the sale or transfer of all or part of the business, we will seek to notify users of the ownership change by way of a prominent notice posted on our Web site. We also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and or in the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, bankruptcy or similar legal process. PeopleFluent does not share, sell, rent, or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

**Security**

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal information, PeopleFluent has adopted appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we process. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Data maintained by PeopleFluent is protected by computer security mechanisms including firewalls, encryption, monitoring software, data and network segmentation, and passwords. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number and your login information) on our order forms or application sites, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If, during their employment, PeopleFluent employees acquire confidential or proprietary information belonging to PeopleFluent or its customers, such information is required to be handled in confidence and may not be disclosed to unauthorized third parties. PeopleFluent employees are also responsible for the internal security of such information. PeopleFluent provides information and training to all employees who have access to data maintained on behalf of PeopleFluent customers. Employees who violate PeopleFluent security and safe maintenance of data policies are subject to appropriate discipline including, but not limited to, termination.
