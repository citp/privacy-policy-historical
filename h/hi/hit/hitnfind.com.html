However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be  able to provide you with some of the services. <br>
        When you surf the Internet, your  Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator(r) or Microsoft Internet Explorer)  automatically transmits some information to HitNFind.com every time you  access content on one of our sites. Examples of such information include the  URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP  (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser  version you are using to access our site. An IP address is a number that is  assigned to your computer when using the Internet. When you visit this website,  our servers will log your IP address which we will use for administrative  reasons. We may disclose your IP address to our service providers. All of this  information may be collected by HitNFind.com and used to help improve our  offerings to you. </p>

These companies may use information (not  including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your  visits to this and other Web sites to provide advertisements about goods or  services that may be of interest to you. <br>

      <p><strong>How HitNFind.com uses and information  collected. </strong> <br>
        We use the personal information  you supply us, including your registration data, to enhance our services,  fulfill your requests for products, programs, or services, personalize your  experience and provide you or permit others to provide you with special offers  we think you will find valuable. We analyses the behaviour of its users,  identifying their demographic characteristics and personal interests. <br>
        We also use your registration data  information in connection with the competitions and other promotions in order  to track your progress, to notify you if you are a winner and to ensure that we  comply with the applicable laws. <br>
        We may also use the information we  collect to develop summary reports for our advertisers. We provide this  information to assist our advertisers in determining how to promote their  products. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on  their advertisements unless you have told us this is acceptable. <br>
        Unless you have opted out of  receiving special offers, emails or other communications from selected third  parties, we also may provide a report to our advertiser which tells them who  responded to a particular offer. For example, we might send you an email,  launch a new window within your internet browser, or send you other  advertisements in electronic form which offer you a discount on a particular  good or service. If you click on that e-mail or advertisement or accept an  offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the advertiser with the  information necessary to provide you with that discount or offer. <br>
        HitNFind.com  may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide  Personally Identifiable Information to appropriate governmental authorities. If  requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, we will provide this  information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. <br>
        Other companies that place  advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or  click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies (using the  same techniques as described above). Due to the way the Internet technically  operates, we cannot control this collection of information. As the consumer you  should contact these advertisers or content providers that place information on  the website directly if you have any questions about their use of the  information they potentially collect. <br>

When you do authorise us to disclose your personal  data to third parties we will only disclose it to the extent agreed. Where you  have permitted us to pass your data to third parties, we will not be  responsible for the use of your personal data by such third parties because the  behaviour of such third parties will be outside of our control. Where your  personal data is to be transferred out of the European Union, we will ask you  for your specific consent to such transfer beforehand. In all cases where  personal data is not going to be used solely by this website, you will be  informed at the time the data is collected from you. <br>
