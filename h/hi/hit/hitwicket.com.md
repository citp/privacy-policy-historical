# Hitwicket - Privacy Site

Octathorpe Web-Consultants Pvt Ltd, a company with its registered address at Hyderabad, India, the publisher of Hitwicket.com, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website, www.hitwicket.com 

Hitwicket processes the data itself and is the legal entity responsible for processing the data. 

### Data Collected

Hitwicket stores user data that has either been submitted to our system by you (such as account details or in-game communication), data that has been created or logged automatically by our systems (for example IP logs or game updates), as well as any manual notes that has been added by customer service, developers to record account events. 

### Information Automatically Logged

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. IP addresses are also logged and used for security purposes, and may be used in abuse investigations or to identify cheaters within the game itself. 

### Cookies

We do not use cookies to extract information from you, solely to simplify your visits, mainly by having cookies remember which language and specific part of the site you want to start your visit with, or to remember last login date so that we can distinguish new users from returning ones. A temporary cookie is also used to keep track of your "session". Without that temporary cookie (which is not stored after you quit your browser) you would have had to log on again on each page. You can turn off cookies in your web browser (more information about this is available at http://www.aboutcookies.org/). This will however make it more or less impossible to access many of the functions on our web site. When you follow links from Hitwicket to other web sites, these may install tracking cookies on your computer. This is beyond the control of Hitwicket. 

### Advertisers

We reserve the right to use cookies for the purpose of serving and/or targeting ads, offers and other marketing messages. No personal customer data is ever shared with the advertising companies. 

### Registration Forms

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail). Contact information from the registration forms is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. It is in the users interest to submit truthful information, as this is also used to verify the user's right to his or her account. The customer's e-mail address is used to send an e-mail verification message, Hitwicket newsletters (this can be opted out from), password reminders upon request, inactivity reminders, information about changes in the terms of use and very seldomly information about new features to users with deleted accounts. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

### External Links

This site contains links to other sites. Hitwicket is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

### Special Relationships

Hitwicket will not share customer data with outside companies or sites, even if we have a special relationship with them. Sponsors, business partners, co-branded sites or content providers may get the opportunity to offer products and services to you within the Hitwicket web site, but we will ask you before passing on any of your personal information to other parties. The only exception is if another company needs the data for the operation of the service and they agree to adhere to our privacy policy or if Hitwicket would transfer substantially all of its assets relating to the game to another company. 

### Public Forums

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
