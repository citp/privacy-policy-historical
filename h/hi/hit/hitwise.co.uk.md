 **What personally identifiable information is collected?**   
Hitwise collects information in a fair and lawful manner for the purposes of identification and billing. Hitwise may collect details from newsletter subscribers and customers of our service that include name, address, e-mail address, fax and telephone numbers. Other demographic information may be collected for the purpose of in-house direct marketing campaigns, in accordance with relevant Legislation. A newsletter subscriber (or a customer) may however, choose to opt out of such campaigns through contacting the Privacy Manager at [privacy@hitwise.com](mailto:privacy@hitwise.com). 

**Are Cookies and Log files used?**   
In some circumstances, Hitwise uses cookies to enhance the functionality of the service we offer our customers. A cookie is a piece of text that can be entered into the memory of a computer, and is used to identify a customer and to store registration details so that the customer is no longer required to re-enter these details on subsequent visits. In addition, Hitwise uses cookies to indicate the number of computers used by each customer to log-in to the Hitwise service, to prevent abuse of the system and logins ([See Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20050325033520id_/http%3A//www.hitwise.co.uk/info/conditions.html)). Hitwise also collects information on IP addresses and web browsers used by customers when they access the service for the same reasons mentioned above. 

**Does Hitwise disclose information to Third Parties?**   
Hitwise does not share information with any Third Parties, and takes every care to ensure the security of information held. Details of Hitwise customers may be divulged to appropriate parties only if a requirement under law, statute or regulation. 

Hitwise does not collect or compile personally identifiable information for the dissemination or sale to outside parties for consumer marketing purposes. Hitwise reserves the right to make mention of other users of the Hitwise service only if the inquiring party is from the same organisation. 

**Links to Third Party Sites**   
Hitwise encourages its customers to review the privacy and security policies of externally linked websites that may be accessed through Hitwise. Hitwise assumes no responsibility for the information practices of any sites that a user can access through Hitwise. 

**Can I change or delete information secured?**   
Hitwise does its utmost to ensure the quality of its data, and as such invites newsletter subscribers and customers of the service to access or update their details as necessary. Hitwise is committed to providing reasonable and practical access to allow visitors the opportunity to identify and correct any inaccurate details we may hold. This can be done by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/myhitwise/editdetails.html) or through contacting the Privacy Manager at [privacy@hitwise.com](mailto:privacy@hitwise.com).

All newsletter subscribers and customers have the right to access or update personal data that they have submitted through the Hitwise website by clicking here or by contacting the Privacy Manager at [privacy@hitwise.com](mailto:privacy@hitwise.com). Should subscribers and customers subsequently choose to unsubscribe from mailing lists we will provide instructions on how to unsubscribe on the appropriate website area or in said communications. On request, Hitwise will delete personally identifiable information that has been submitted from the current database. 

**Children's Online Privacy Protection**   
Hitwise has established password protection procedures in place to ensure that only customers access the service as the service is not intended to be used by children or minors under the age of eighteen. Hitwise assumes all its newsletter subscribers and customers to be over the age of eighteen or that parental permission has been obtained prior to subscription or use of our services.
