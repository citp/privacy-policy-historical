As part of this process, we may from time to time, ask you to provide us with certain personal information, for example, your name, date of birth, email address and credit card details. 

**Protecting your privacy**   
  
HITFARM takes all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our customers and ensure that the personal information we collect is not ordinarily disclosed to third parties without the customer's consent.   
  
However, there may be times when HITFARM may be required to disclose personal information of a customer without their express consent. This may occur where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against the customer or another person who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of HITFARM or its associates, affiliates, other customers or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; or required by law. 

**WHY WE NEED TO OBTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU**   
  
Your personal information is used to enable us to deliver our online products and services to you. For example most of our products and services require some form of registration or subscription, while others require a payment to be made via a secure credit card facility. Your contact details may also be required from time to time to notify you of competition prizes you may have won.   
  
Some of the information we collect, including that obtained from our customer feedback facilities, is used to help us develop and improve the quality of our products and services, which in turn, provides you with a more satisfying and enjoyable online experience. 

**WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**   
  
Your email address and other personal information may be used to enable us to send you marketing or promotional material (such as promotional offers) on other products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. However, you may at any time, notify us that you do not wish to receive this material via an "opt-out" facility contained on our websites.   
  
If you no longer wish us to keep a record of your personal information or you need to some of the particulars (for example, your address), you may contact us at the member information page on our websites or by emailing our Customer Support Group at webmaster@HITFARM.com, so we can correct, update or remove the information you have given us.   
  
The information you provide to HITFARM is also shared among our subsidiaries and the operators of our affiliated websites.   
  
HITFARM also shares collective information about our users (on an anonymous basis) with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we may disclose the fact that membership to one of our websites is "X" percent male and "Y" percent female.   
  
This data is used to gain a better understanding of our customer base, thus enabling us to tailor our website content to our customers specific wants and needs. 

**HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU**   
  
HITFARM may collect personal information about you and your surfing habits in a number of ways, including:   
  
Directly from you, such as when you enter your personal details on our websites to register or subscribe to our services); Indirectly, by keeping a record of our users IP addresses and through the use of "cookies". 

**Use of IP Addresses**   
  
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, (the big computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address.   
  
We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from our sites, our servers may log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.   
  
Some services provided by HITFARM, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only uses those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.
