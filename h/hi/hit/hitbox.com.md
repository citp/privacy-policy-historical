**What Are Cookies**   
Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet user’s computer that are designed to store basic information (such as visitor preferences). The use of cookies on this Site allows visitors to enjoy more seamless visits and more accurately measures visitor behavior on the Site. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an Internet user’s online session. They disappear from the user’s computer when he/she closes the browser software. Persistent cookies remain on the user’s computer after the browser has been closed. The cookies used on the Site do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by personalizing a web page or requesting more information on a product or service. Otherwise you remain anonymous. 

**How We Use Cookies**   
When you interact with the Site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site, our web server uses cookies to improve your interaction with the Site by, for example, remembering your preferences. More specifically, Omniture uses cookies to measure your behavior on this Site and to save personal settings on specific pages. For our corporate customers who login to the Omniture products through the Site, cookies can also be used to save the username and password so that Omniture can process the saved login information and quickly log that user into the product. Cookies also help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in. Omniture uses cookies (that only Omniture can read and use) to identify the fact that you are an Omniture customer or a prior Site visitor (whatever the case may be). Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse the Site; however, they may lose some of the functionality provided by the use of cookies. When examining your cookies you may notice a cookie that is set by the domain - 2o7.net. The 2o7.net domain is the primary domain we use to measure visitor behavior on this Site and on our customers’ websites (acting on our customer’s behalf).

If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.

**What are Clear Gifs?**   
Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help Site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the Site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. 

**How We Use Clear Gifs**   
We utilize clear gifs to measure visitor behavior, to help us improve visitor experience, and to manage site content. We, and our Subsidiaries, may use clear gifs on this Site, in our e-mails, in our advertisements on other web sites, or in our advertisements in others' e-mails.

## Security

Our Site has physical, administrative and technical measures in place to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the data under our control, and to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of such data.. For example, when our Site is accessed using Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0, or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that the data is safe, secure, and available only to our corporate customers and us. In addition, Omniture uses secured server areas and advanced firewall technology to minimize the risk of security breaches for individually identifiable information that is volunteered on the Site. Finally, Omniture provides unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a corporate customer, or an Omniture employee that has a business need to access the information, logs on to an Omniture product via this Site. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of all data. 

While we strive to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us. You send any information via this Site at your own risk.
