We at Adobe want to earn your trust by telling providing you transparency on how we collect and use information on behalf of our customers about your visits to our customers’ websites and by control over your information. This web site describes our information collection and use practices and allows you to opt out from having your browsing information collected and used to provide optimization services for our customers. We will also give you some useful links to web sites where you can learn more about protecting your privacy.

Adobe SiteCatalyst HBX's [Web analytics](https://web.archive.org/en/products/web_analytics) services generally do not collect any personally identifiable information you provide to web sites that use our services. Because we generally do not collect personally identifiable information from visitors to our customers' sites, we cannot associate, merge, or link the browsing information (which is not personally identifiable) that we do collect with your personally identifiable information.

However, some of our customers using SiteCatalyst HBX collect personally identifiable information (such as e-mail addresses) and share it with us to allow them to provide more relevant content and services to their website visitors. In situations where our customers provide us personally identifiable information, we collect and retain the personally identifiable information only on our customers' behalf, acting as our customers' agent, and will not share, disclose, report, transfer or deliver such personally identifiable information to any person or entity other than our customer. 

### Our Cookies

Your browser offers web servers to set cookies on your browser that store small amounts of data on your computer about your visits to the website. For example, cookies assist us in associating your preferences with the SiteCatalyst HBX service or to understand what content you access on our customer’s site. And when you re-visit one of our customer’s site who uses the SiteCatalyst HBX service, our cookies can enable us to recognize that you are a return visitor and to analyze web behavior for website optimization purposes.

When we collect personally identifiable information on our customers' behalf, acting as our customers' agent, we may use cookies to associate that information with your browsing patterns on such customers' web pages.

### Web Beacons

The web pages of our customers using SiteCatalyst HBX [Web analytics](https://web.archive.org/en/products/web_analytics) services contain electronic image requests (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon" request) that allow us to measure session activity, including counting page views and accessing cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically 1-by-1 pixel files. We include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. The web beacons used in connection with the SiteCatalyst HBX services do not intentionally collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our web site visitors, they are generally just the technique we use to compile our anonymous information about web site usage.

### Browser Profiles

Through our SiteCatalyst HBX technology, we also collect and accumulate other anonymous information that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For example, we accumulate visitor data relating to referring domains, the type of browsers used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 7 vs. XP), screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. We also record number of visits, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages. None of this information is personally identifiable and we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall web site or Internet usage trends.
