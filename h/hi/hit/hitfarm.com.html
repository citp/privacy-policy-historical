<p class="privacy"> <b>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</b> <br>
<img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
HITFARM may collect personal information about you and your surfing habits in a number of ways, including: <br>
<img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
Directly from you, such as when you enter your personal details on our websites to register or subscribe to our services); Indirectly, by keeping a record of our users IP addresses and through the use of "cookies". </p>
<p class="privacy"> <b>Use of IP Addresses</b> <br>
<img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, (the big computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address. <br>
<img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from our sites, our servers may log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others. <br>
<img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
Some services provided by HITFARM, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only uses those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing. </p>
