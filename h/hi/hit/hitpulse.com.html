                        This site is owned and operated by Logiscape Technologies 
                        Inc. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance 
                        to us. At Logiscape Technologies, we want to make your 
                        experience online satisfying and safe. 
                        <p>Because we gather certain types of information about 
                          our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms 
                          and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that 
                          information. This privacy statement discloses what information 
                          we gather and how we use it.</p>
                        <p>Definition of the Information Logiscape Technologies 
                          gathers and keeps track of.</p>
                        <p>Logiscape Technologies gathers two types of information 
                          about users:</p>
                        <p>• Information that users provide through optional, 
                          voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions 
                          to receive more information on our services, special 
                          promotions<br>
                          or to receive our newsletter.<br>
                          • Information Logiscape Technologies gathers through 
                          aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying 
                          page views throughout our sites. This information allows 
                          us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and 
                          to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand 
                          the demographics of our audience. Because Logiscape 
                          Technologies derives its revenue mainly from its services, 
                          providing such aggregated demographic data is essential 
                          to keeping our services tailored to our users. Under 
                          no circumstances does Logiscape Technologies divulge 
                          any information about an individual user to a third 
                          party. </p>
                        <p>Logiscape Technologies Gathers User Information In 
                          The Following Processes:</p>
                        <p>Optional Voluntary Information</p>
                        <p>We may offer the following free services, which require 
                          some type of voluntary submission of personal information 
                          by users:</p>
                        <p>1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)</p>
                        <p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. 
                          Logiscape Technologies gathers the email addresses of 
                          users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves 
                          from this mailing list by following the link provided 
                          in every newsletter that points users to the subscription 
                          management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters 
                          at the time of registration.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>2. "E-mail this to a friend" Service</p>
                        <p>Our site users can choose to electronically forward 
                          a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking 
                          "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide 
                          their email address, as well as that of the recipient. 
                          This information is used only in the case of transmission 
                          errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who 
                          sent the email. The information is not used for any 
                          other purpose.</p>
                        <p>3. Polling</p>
                        <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can 
                          easily share their opinions with other users and see 
                          what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions 
                          or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not 
                          identifiable to any particular user. Logiscape Technologies 
                          may use a system to "tag" users after they 
                          have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular 
                          question. This tag is not correlated with information 
                          about individual users.</p>
                        <p>4. Surveys</p>
                        <p>Logiscape Technologies may occasionally conduct user 
                          surveys to better target our content to our audience. 
                          We never share any of this information about specific 
                          individuals with any third party.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          USAGE TRACKING</p>
                        <p>Logiscape Technologies tracks user traffic patterns 
                          throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate 
                          this information with data about individual users. Logiscape 
                          Technologies does break down overall usage statistics 
                          according to a user's domain name, browser type, and 
                          MIME type by reading this information from the browser 
                          string (information contained in every user's browser).</p>
                        <p>Logiscape Technologies sometimes tracks and catalogs 
                          the search terms that users enter in our Search function, 
                          but this tracking is never associated with individual 
                          users. We use tracking information to determine which 
                          areas of our sites users like and don't like based on 
                          traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual 
                          users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. 
                          This helps us continue to build a better service for 
                          you.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>COOKIES</p>
                        <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" 
                          in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself 
                          does not contain Personal Information although it will 
                          enable us to relate your use of this site to information 
                          that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But 
                          the only personal information a cookie can contain is 
                          information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read 
                          data off your hard disk or read cookie files created 
                          by other sites. Logiscape Technologies uses cookies 
                          to track user traffic patterns (as described above). 
                          Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to 
                          better track ad impressions and click rates.</p>
                        <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your 
                          browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before 
                          accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message 
                          with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned 
                          on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to 
                          participate actively in message boards, forums, polling 
                          and surveys.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          USE OF INFORMATION</p>
                        <p>Logiscape Technologies uses any information voluntarily 
                          given by our users to enhance their experience in our 
                          network of sites, whether to provide interactive or 
                          personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare 
                          future content based on the interests of our users.</p>
                        <p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily 
                          provide in order to send out electronic newsletters 
                          and to enable users to participate in polls and surveys. 
                          We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular 
                          schedule, and occasionally send out special editions 
                          when we think subscribers might be particularly interested 
                          in something we are doing. Logiscape Technologies never 
                          shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, 
                          including advertisers, sponsors or partners.</p>
                        <p>When we use tracking information to determine which 
                          areas of our sites users like and don't like based on 
                          traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual 
                          users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. 
                          This helps us continue to build a better service for 
                          you. We track search terms entered in Search function 
                          as one of many measures of what interests our users. 
                          But we don't track which terms a particular user enters. 
                        </p>
                        <p><br>
                          SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</p>
                        <p>Logiscape Technologies uses the above-described information 
                          to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our 
                          advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. 
                          This is essential to keeping our service free. We will 
                          not share information about individual users with any 
                          third party, except to comply with applicable law or 
                          valid legal process or to protect the personal safety 
                          of our users or the public.</p>
                        <p>SECURITY</p>
                        <p>Logiscape Technologies operates secure data networks 
                          protected by industry standard firewall and password 
                          protection systems. Our security and privacy policies 
                          are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary 
                          and only authorized individuals have access to the information 
                          provided by our customers.</p>
                        <p>OPT-OUT POLICY</p>
                        <p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. 
                          Such choices include:</p>
                        <p>• Opting not to register to receive our electronic 
                          newsletters. <br>
                          • Opting not to participate in certain interactive 
                          areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather 
                          any personally identifiable information from our users 
                          <br>
