"Cookies" can make the site more useful by storing information about your preferences on the site. "Cookies" in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user´s computer.  We and our third party service providers may also use pixel tags (also known as web beacons, web bugs, and clear GIFs) on our site and in emails. A pixel tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a webpage or in an email message.

As an example, after registering at a website, you may be asked to login each time you returned.

We contract with third party advertising companies to tailor online advertising to be directed to you on other websites.  These third party advertising companies place, use, or rely on technology, such as cookies and pixel tags, to obtain information about your interactions with our site as well as with other websites.
