# Hills Bank and Trust Company

Hills Bank and Trust Company has always considered your privacy and the confidentiality of your financial information a high priority. We want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it. In order to provide our customers with a broad range of financial products and services as effectively and conveniently as possible, we use technology to manage and maintain customer information. The following policy serves as a standard for all Hills Bank and Trust Company employees for collection, use, retention, and security of nonpublic personal information.

What Information We Collect  
We may collect “nonpublic personal information” about you from the following sources: information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms; information we receive from you on insurance applications; information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others; and information we receive from third parties such as credit bureaus.

“Nonpublic personal information” is nonpublic information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. For example, nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account balance, payment history, and credit and debit card purchase information.

What Information We Disclose  
We may disclose information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf. For example, from time to time we may use service providers to assist us in marketing our products to you through direct mail.

We are also permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal information about you to “nonaffiliated third parties” in certain other circumstances. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to third parties to assist us in servicing your loan or account with us, to government entities in response to subpoenas, and to credit bureaus. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to any other third parties, except as permitted by law. We do not sell our customer information to any third party.  
If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.

Our Security Procedures  
We also take steps to safeguard customer information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

We can be reached via e-mail at hillsbank@hillsbank.com or you can reach us by telephone at 1-800-445-5725.

Electronic Delivery of Customer Information Agreement and Disclosure

This agreement states the terms and conditions that apply when you use Hills Bank Online™, PowerPay™, Push Button Banker, and eStatement (“Electronic Services”). These terms and conditions are in addition to those that apply to any accounts you have with us or any other services you obtain from us. You must also follow all of our instructions and procedures applicable to the services covered by this agreement.

“You” and “your” refer to each person who establishes Electronic Services with us or who uses or is authorized to use a Hills Bank Online or Push Button Banker identification number and password or other means of access we establish or approve. The terms “Hills Bank Online”, “PowerPay”, “Push Button Banker”, and “eStatement” refer to our services that allow you to make payments, transfer funds, access accounts, obtain information, receive bank statements, and perform other transactions over the Internet and/or telephone. Hills Bank and Trust Company reserves the right to suspend your use of Electronic Services at any time.

eSTATEMENT  
By enrolling in eStatement, “you” (Owner) have requested and Hills Bank and Trust Company (“Bank”) has agreed to notify you via the email address you provide to the Bank, notice that all of your bank account statements and other information* are electronically available with Hills Bank Online (read the section on Hills Bank Online for more detailed information about this service). The Bank will send electronically to the same email address a message containing a notice of how to view available information by accessing Hills Bank Online, or a message containing a link to HillsBank.com where the information is located. By receiving your statement electronically, you will not receive a hard copy of your bank account statement or any images of your canceled checks. Your electronic bank account statement will provide the numbers of each check that has cleared, the amount of each check, and the date of payment posting. If you request a hard copy of either your bank statement or any check referenced in that statement, normal research fees will apply. If you request a copy of a check from the Bank, the Bank will provide a legible copy of the check within a reasonable period of time. You have the ability to view your canceled checks online with Hills Bank Online by viewing your transaction history. 

To access the information you will need the following:

  1. Access to the Internet and an email address;
  2. An Internet browser that supports 128-bit encryption;
  3. A Hills Bank Online ID and PIN; 
  4. Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on the computer that you use to view the information (a link to download a current copy of this software is found on the Hills Bank and Trust Company web site); and
  5. A printer that will allow you to print the information that you are viewing, or you must be able to retain an electronic copy so that you will be able to access the information at a later date.



If you wish to receive a paper copy of a disclosure or other information* that is presented to you electronically, please call 1-800-445-5725, or email hillsbank@hillsbank.com, or write to Hills Bank and Trust Company Customer Service, 131 Main St PO Box 70 Hills, Iowa 52235. Please be as specific as possible regarding the information you are requesting. Do not send personal information such as account numbers or Social Security Numbers in email, as it is not secure. Statements and notices will only be mailed to the address we have on file. There is no fee to request a paper copy of a regulatory notice or a copy of the changes of fees or terms on your account. If you wish to have a paper copy of a statement or check, normal research fees will apply.

If you decide to have your bank account information sent electronically, sign the Electronic Services application and indicate which accounts you would like to have set up for eStatement. In the future if you wish to stop receiving your bank account information electronically, your account(s) will be subject to the current fees and charges in effect at that time. This agreement will remain in effect until we receive a written request from you to cancel it.

By enrolling, you agree to the terms stated above and are able to meet the minimum requirements for printing or retaining the information that is provided to you. You understand that you have a duty to exercise reasonable promptness in examining the electronic statement or the items referenced to determine whether any payment was not authorized because of an alteration of an item or because a purported signature by or on behalf of you or other signatory on the account was not authorized. The statute of limitations governing these responsibilities will commence at the time the email is sent by the Bank to you. You agree to inform us if your email address changes.

*Other information to be delivered to you at a later date includes but is not limited to: regulatory disclosures, past due notices, NSF notices, marketing information, confirmations or changes to the account, as applicable.

HILLS BANK ONLINE

IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND PASSWORD  
To access Hills Bank Online you must use the identification number and/or other means of access we establish or provide for your use of Hills Bank Online together with a PIN. Anyone to whom you give your Hills Bank Online identification number and PIN or other means of access will have full access to your accounts even if you attempt to limit that person's authority. Your PIN must be at least six (6) characters in length and no more than eight (8) and must be alphanumeric. The PIN expires at least every three months. You can change your PIN more often if you feel it is necessary. For questions on how to change your PIN, contact Hills Bank Online Customer Support. Your PIN should not be something easily identifiable such as your name; having a number in the middle of the PIN (as opposed to the beginning or end) makes it more secure.

When you enter your ID and PIN at the Hills Bank Online login page, that information is sent over a secure connection to our banking partner, Jack Henry and Associates (JHA). JHA verifies that your ID and PIN are correct and processes your request to access your accounts with Hills Bank and Trust Company. If you make an error in your entry of the ID and/or PIN, you will not gain access to Hills Bank Online. After three unsuccessful login attempts, your account is locked for 24 hours to prevent an unauthorized person from accessing your accounts.

INTERNET SECURITY  
Hills Bank Online includes features to provide security of your online session. However, you also need to take some responsibility. This includes using the most secure Internet browser available to you. Hills Bank Online offers a link that tests your browsers’ encryption levels. This link also gives you recommendations for making your browser more secure. Hills Bank Online requires the use of 128-bit encryption for the greatest possible security. Use the Test Browser link to see if your browser meets this level of security. For more information, please contact Hills Bank Online Customer Support at (319) 679-5577.   
Other security issues: 

  * Cookie Files – Hills Bank Online requires the use of cookie files (a small text file that your browser puts on your computer). They are used primarily for the time-out feature of Hills Bank Online. We do not use cookie files to trace what you do while logged in to Hills Bank Online. Cookies do not carry any personal information about you nor can they carry a virus very easily. For more information about cookies, including enabling them, visit our web site. 
  * Pseudo Account Names – Hills Bank Online does not display your account numbers on the Internet; we use the name you indicate on your Hills Bank Online application. You can change these names whenever you like. 
  * Login Count – A counter keeps track of the number of times you have logged in to access your accounts. You can reset this counter at anytime, if desired.



HILLS BANK ONLINE ACCOUNT ACCESS  
Accounts owned by you (either individually or jointly with another person) may be added to your Hills Bank Online service. We require your approval in writing prior to allowing any signer on your account (other than a joint owner) online access to your account. Accounts requiring multiple signatures for withdrawals will not have the ability to transfer funds and may not be accessed via Hills Bank Online.

POWER PAY™  
This service allows you to pay bills using the Internet. To use PowerPay: your account must be a checking account and you must be at least 18 years of age. We do not process the payments at Hills Bank and Trust Company. We contract with JHA and Princeton eCom to provide this service for us. For electronic payments, the payment amount is withdrawn from your checking account and sent to the designated payee on your behalf. For check payments, a paper check is mailed to your payee and the funds are withdrawn when the check clears your checking account with Hills Bank and Trust Company.

When initiating a payment using our PowerPay service, you must allow lead-times of 3-business days for electronic payments and 5-business days for check payments. Therefore, the payment date you enter is not the date your bill is due but the date you want the payment process to start. For complete PowerPay information, refer to the PowerPay Questions and Answers found on our web site, visit any office, or call Hills Bank Online Customer Support at (319) 679-5577. We will mail you a copy of these Questions and Answers when you register with PowerPay. Please contact us if you do not receive this information.

LIMITS ON HILLS BANK ONLINE TRANSACTIONS  
You must have sufficient available funds or credit in any account from which you instruct us to make a payment or transfer. If you are a Money Market or Savings Account holder, law limits the number of withdrawals you make each month. This includes those done on Hills Bank Online. You should refer to the Terms and Conditions of Your Account for more information on the restrictions on these accounts. You can request copies of the Terms and Conditions of Your Account at the time you complete the Electronic Services Application form.

FEES FOR HILLS BANK ONLINE AND POWERPAY  
Hills Bank Online is a free service. The PowerPay charge is $5.95 (including tax) per month. The first 90 days are free; payments will subsequently be debited from the account you have set up for PowerPay. Hills Bank and Trust Company charges for the following requests of PowerPay payments: Stop Payments – $20 per item (effective November 15, 2002 the fee will be $25); Insufficient Funds - $20 per item (effective November 15, 2002 the fee will be $25); Copy of Canceled Check - $1.00 per check (customers can print their own canceled PowerPay checks and avoid the respective fee by using Hills Bank Online). The monthly fees for PowerPay will be deducted from your account when your statement cuts. Any other fees (Stop Payments, NSF items, etc.) will be deducted from your account the day they are incurred.

PUSH BUTTON BANKER

ACCESS NUMBER  
To access Push Button Banker, you must use the PIN and/or other means of access we establish or provide for this service. Anyone to whom you give your Push Button Banker PIN will have full access to your accounts even if you attempt to limit that person's authority. The PIN for Push Button Banker is four-digits in length and you will choose this PIN when you first use Push Button Banker. You can change your PIN as often as you feel it necessary. For questions on how to change your PIN, contact Hills Bank Customer Service at (319) 679-5500 or toll-free at (800) 445-5725. Your PIN should not be something easily identifiable such as your date of birth, address, etc. If an error occurs in your entry of the PIN, you will not gain access to Push Button Banker. After three unsuccessful login attempts, your account is locked; this is to prevent an unauthorized person from accessing your accounts. To unlock your Push Button Banker account, you need to contact Hills Bank Customer Service to have your PIN reset.

PUSH BUTTON BANKER ACCOUNT  
You may not designate for Push Button Banker any account that requires more than one signature for withdrawals. Only accounts owned by you (either individually or jointly with another person) may be added to your Push Button Banker service. If a signer on your account requests access to that account, we contact you prior to allowing that signer access and get your approval in writing. 

LIMITS ON PUSH BUTTON BANKER TRANSACTIONS

If you are a Money Market or Savings Account holder, the number of withdrawals you make each month are limited by law. This includes those done on Push Button Banker.

OUR LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO COMPLETE PAYMENTS OR TRANSFERS  
If we do not complete a payment or transfer on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages directly related to the error. However, there are exceptions. We will NOT be liable in the following situations:

  1. If, through no fault of ours, you do not have sufficient available funds in the account from which payment or transfer is to be made, or if the account has been closed or is not in good standing, or if we reverse a payment or transfer because of insufficient funds.
  2. If any payment or transfer would cause an overdraft or exceed the credit limit of any account.
  3. If your equipment, or ours, was not working properly and the breakdown should have been apparent to you when you attempted to conduct the transaction.
  4. If you have not given us complete, correct, or current account numbers or other identifying information so that we can properly access your account or otherwise complete the transaction.
  5. If you do not properly follow our instructions or if you provide us with inaccurate information or fail to correct or notify us about any inaccuracy of which you are aware.
  6. If you do not allow adequate lead-time for your payment or transfer to be received and credited by the time it is due.
  7. If the money in the account from which a payment or transfer is to be made is subject to legal process or other claim that restricts the transaction.
  8. If circumstances or persons beyond our control prevent, delay, intercept, or alter the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken, including but not limited to, telecommunication outages of the Internet, Hills Bank Online, or Push Button Banker. 



CONFIDENTIALITY  
We will disclose information to third parties about your account, or the transfers that you make, under the following conditions:

  1. When it is necessary for completing transfers; or
  2. In order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant; or
  3. In order to comply with government agency or court orders; or
  4. If you give us written permission.



For more detailed information on confidentiality, please read our Privacy Statement.

BUSINESS DAYS  
Our Hills Bank Online and Push Button Banker services are generally available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, we only process transactions and update information on business days, which are Monday through Friday. Transfers made after 6:00 p.m. CST will be processed on the next business day. Bank holidays are not considered business days.

STATEMENTS  
Your Electronic Services payments and transfers will be indicated on the monthly or quarterly statements we provide. You agree to notify us promptly if you change your address or if you believe there are any errors or unauthorized transactions on any statement, or statement information (see section below for more information on unauthorized transactions).

EMAIL  
When sending the Bank email, do not include confidential information such as account numbers, Social Security Numbers, your Hills Bank Online or Push Button Banker PIN, credit card numbers, etc. since email is not secure. We will not ask you for your account number via email. Not all email arrives at its destination, so for situations that require immediate action (stolen checkbook or Hills Bank Check Card, fraudulent activity on your account(s), etc.), call Hills Bank Customer Service at (319) 679-5500 or toll-free at (800) 445-5725. If you choose to send inquiries via email, we will reply to them as soon as possible; if after hours, in most cases we will respond the next business day.

YOUR LIABILITY  
Each of you agrees, for yourself to the terms of this account and the schedule of charges that may be imposed. You authorize us to deduct these charges as accrued directly from the account balance. You are liable for all transactions that you or any one you authorize makes, even if the person you authorize exceeds your authority. If you have given someone your Hills Bank Online identification number and PIN, Push Button Banker PIN, or other means of access and you want to terminate that person's authority, you must change your identification number and PIN or other means of access or take additional steps to prevent further access by such person.

UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS OR LOSS OR THEFT OF YOUR HILLS BANK ONLINE™ IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OR PASSWORD  
If you believe your Hills Bank Online identification number or PIN, Push Button Banker PIN, or other means of access have been lost, stolen, or used without your authorization call Hills Bank Customer Service immediately at (319) 679-5500 or toll-free at (800) 445-5725 during normal business hours. After hours, you may email us at hillsonline@hillsbank.com or write to us at PO Box 160 Hills, Iowa 52235. Quickly telephoning us is the best way of reducing your possible losses, since not all emails may arrive at their destinations. We will reply via email to confirm that we did receive your notification. Because email is not secure, do not include any of your account or Social Security Numbers with your email. Your name, address, and a brief message describing the problem are all we will need. 

If you believe your ID and PIN have been used without your permission and you tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft, you are liable for no more than $50. If you do not tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or misuse and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your ID and PIN without your permission had we been notified, you are liable for up to $500.

If, after receiving your statement, you notice transfers that you did not make, inform us at once. If we are not informed within 60 days after the statement was mailed, you may not be reimbursed any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the funds if you had notified us in time.   
If extenuating circumstances exist (extended vacation, hospital stay, etc.) which kept you from telling us, we will extend the time limit.

GOVERNING LAW  
You agree that this agreement, as well as any all transactions partly or wholly executed or facilitated by Electronic Services, shall be governed by the law of the State of Iowa.
