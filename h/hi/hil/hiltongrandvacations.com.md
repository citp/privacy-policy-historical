    * to allow our business partners to recognize you when you visit that partner's website or app, or to recognize you as one of their customers when you visit HGV websites or apps so that they may provide more relevant offers to you. We may share your email address with such partners using available security measures that may match it with their own email addresses so that they can send online and email advertisements to you on our behalf. Such data transfers are based on legitimate business interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) or your consent, Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.

6.2 _Buyers:_ As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or reorganize businesses assets or our Website. In such circumstances, HGV may transfer, sell or assign personal data, to the respective buyers.

  7. **Cross-Border Data Transfer**

7.1 Some of the recipients of your personal data will be located or may have relevant operations outside of your country and the EU, where the data protection laws may provide a different level of protection compared to the laws in your jurisdiction and with regard to which an adequacy decision by the European Commission does not exist.

7.2 The countries which provide an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective (Art. 45 GDPR) include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (commercial organizations), Faeroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Uruguay. Recipients in the US may be certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective (Art. 45 GDPR).

7.3 We may also provide adequate level of data protection by other means. By way of entering into appropriate data transfer agreements based on Standard Contractual Clauses (2010/87/EC and/or 2004/915/EC) as referred to in Art. 46 (5) GDPR or other adequate means, which are accessible upon request under the contact details provided in Section 3 above, we have established that all other recipients located outside the EEA will provide an adequate level of protection for the Personal Data and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. Any onward transfer (including our affiliates outside the EEA) is subject to appropriate onward transfer requirements as required by applicable law.

  8. **Storage Period**

Your personal data is stored by HGV and/or our service providers, strictly to the extent necessary for the performance of our obligations and strictly for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal data is collected, in accordance with applicable data protection laws. For example, personal data contained in contracts, communications, and business letters may be subject to statutory retention requirements, which may require retention of up to 10 years. In addition, if a judicial or disciplinary action is initiated, the personal data may be stored until the end of such action, including any potential periods for appeal, and will then be deleted or archived as permitted by applicable law.

  9. 9\. Your Rights 

9.1 If you have declared your consent for any personal data processing activities, you can withdraw this consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal.

9.2 Under the conditions set out under applicable law, you have the following rights (which might be limited under the applicable national data protection law):

    1. _Right of access:_ You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the personal data.

    6. _Right to object:_

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us and we can be required to no longer process your personal data. If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. Exercising this right will not incur any costs. Such a right to object may not exist, in particular, if the processing of your personal data is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.

9.3 In addition to the rights set out above, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority.
