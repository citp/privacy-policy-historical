# Policies | Hillsong.com

**Hillsong Church Ltd** ABN 37 002 745 879 ( **the Church** ) and our related entities appreciate that privacy is very important. The Church has adopted this Privacy Policy as we recognise the right of people to keep their personal information private. This Privacy Policy covers the Church's treatment of personally identifiable information that we collect or hold. Like many other organisations, the Church must comply with the National Privacy Principles contained in the Australian Privacy Act when dealing with personal information.

##  1\. The information we collect

_All services (including various other activities) of Hillsong Church are recorded. Images of the people attending or participating in the service (or other activity) may be used and shown in our TV ministry, Resources and for other promotional purposes and commercial activities. By attending any service (or other activity) you agree to Hillsong Church using your image and personal information in these recordings._

The Church will collect general information about you, such as your name, address, contact details so the Church can contact you. We may also collect this and other types of personal information during the course of dealing with you, for example when you wish to obtain goods or services from the Church, when you register for conferences or events, and when you participate in Church activities or complete other forms. The information collected may include some sensitive information (as defined by the Privacy Act), such as health information or information about your beliefs, relevant to the services or assistance you have requested from the Church. In the interests of security and safety, and the comfort of the Church community, the Church also operates video cameras within and around some Church premises.  
Where practicable, the purpose for which we collect personal information will be made clear at the time of collection. If you do not provide us with certain information we may be unable to provide you with access to some of our services or the assistance you have requested.

(e) to assist us to make the Church's sites, services and products more valuable to our community;  
(f) for direct promotion of products or services and to keep you informed of new developments we believe may be of interest to you. If we contact you in this way without obtaining your prior consent, we will provide you with the opportunity to decline any further promotional communications;

In some circumstances we may need to disclose sensitive information about you to third parties as part of the services you have requested; and
