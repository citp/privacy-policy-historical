We partner with certain third-party service providers to collect information to engage in analytics, auditing, research, and reporting.  These third parties may use server logs, web beacons, tags, pixels, and similar technologies, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. 

In particular, we use Yahoo Analytics to help us understand how our customers use our websites. You can read more about how Yahoo uses your Personal Information and opt out of the use of cookies in web browsers by Yahoo Analytics by clicking [here](https://policies.yahoo.com/xa/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/analytics/index.htm). We also use [FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com/). The FullStory analytics service uses heat mapping and records mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and keystrokes during your use of our site. This information helps us identify and address technical issues and understand usage of our Services, which we use to improve the Services for you. You can opt-out of our use of FullStory [here](https://www.fullstory.com/optout/). We also partner with 24/7 which supports our chat platform. 24/7 uses tags on websites to determine and enable predictive chat and allow the chat agent to understand what page the guest is on so the agent can provide assistance.

We also partner with third parties to provide advertising services that are targeted based on your online activities across websites, mobile apps, and devices over time (commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising”). Our advertising partners may collect information about your activities on our Services on your current device and combine it with information about your activities on other websites, mobile apps, and devices. They may collect such information using server logs, cookies, web beacons, tags, pixels, mobile advertising IDs (such as Facebook cookies or Google’s Advertising ID), cross-device linking, and similar technologies. For example, our advertising partners may use the fact that you visited our website to target advertising to you on other websites and mobile apps on your current device or on other devices you use. They may match your browsers or devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household. This means that information about your activity on websites or apps on your current browser or device may be combined and used with information collected from your other browsers or devices. You can opt out of interest-based advertising in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by following the instructions below. 

For more information about interest-based advertising and cross-device linking, please visit the [Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-digital-advertising) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website](http://www.aboutads.info/). We adhere to the DAA’s interest-based advertising principles by providing you enhanced notice, transparency, and control of our digital marketing practices as stated at http://www.aboutads.info/principles/. You may opt out of interest-based advertising and cross-device linking in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by following the instructions below. 

  * **Web Browser Opt-Out.** To opt out in web browsers, please visit <http://optout.aboutads.info/> and [http://optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/).  To help preserve the choices that you make in the DAA’s WebChoices page, you can install the DAA’s “Protect My Choices” extension that is available at <http://www.aboutads.info/PMC>. 
  * **Mobile Application Opt-Out.**   To opt out in mobile apps, you can adjust the advertising preferences on your mobile device (for example, in iOS, visit Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking, and in Android, visit Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of interest-based ads).  You can also opt out for companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices tool by downloading it [here](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) and following the instructions in the app.  For more information about opting out on mobile devices, please see [here](https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice).



Please note that the opt-outs described above will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out, and therefore you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile advertising identifiers, change browsers (including upgrading certain browsers), or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work, and you will need to opt out again. We do not respond to Do Not Track signals at this time. ****

  * **The Right to Know, The Right to Delete, and the Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information**

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) affords California consumers (1) the right to know what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and/or sell; (2) the right to request that we delete their personal information; and (3) the right to request that we no longer sell their personal information. 

If you would like information about the personal information that we collect, disclose, and/or sell about you, or if you would like to make a request for us to delete or to stop selling your personal information, please visit our website at [datarights.hilton.com](https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/personal-data-requests/) or click the “Personal Data Requests” link at the bottom of any Hilton website to submit your request. You also may call our toll-free telephone number: (800) 413-7470, email the Data Protection Office (“DPO”) at DataProtectionOffice@Hilton.com, send a letter to the Data Protection Office at 7930 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, Virginia, USA 22102, or complete a paper form available from the front desk at any of our hotels. In addition to these methods, California consumers may request that we no longer sell their personal information by clicking [here](https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/personal-data-requests/).

When the DPO receives your request, the DPO will first verify your identity. If you are a Hilton Honors member, the DPO will verify your identify by asking you to provide your name, Hilton Honors account number, and the email address and phone number associated with your Hilton Honors account. If you are not a Hilton Honors member, the DPO will verify your identity by asking you to provide your name, the confirmation number from one of your stays at a Hilton property, and the email address associated with that stay. Once the DPO has verified your identity, the DPO will promptly fulfill your request.

If you would like, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent, please submit an order issued by a court, a document submitted by a barred attorney, or a formal certified document issued by an official governmental agency.

If you would like to opt out of the sale of your personal information to behavioral advertising networks, you may do so by clicking on the banner that appears on any Hilton website when you access that site from an IP address that relates to California or by visiting our website at [datarights.hilton.com](https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/personal-data-requests/) or click the “Personal Data Requests” link at the bottom of any Hilton website to submit your request. Please note that when you opt out of cookies, tags, and pixels, that opt out only pertains to the device and the browser that you are using when you opt out. If you wish to opt out for other devices or browsers, you must opt out again when you are using those devices or browsers. 

  * **Direct Marketing Disclosure**

California consumers also may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at one of the following addresses: CA_Privacy@Hilton.com or DataProtectionOffice@Hilton.com, send a letter to the Data Protection Office at 7930 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, Virginia, USA 22102. Within thirty days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted to addresses other than the addresses specified in this paragraph.

  * **The Right to Non-Discrimination**

The CCPA prohibits a business from treating a consumer differently because the consumer exercised a right conferred on him/her by the CCPA. We welcome you to exercise your rights under the CCPA, and we will not discriminate against you for doing so. 

  * **Removal of Content**

If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any site where this policy is posted, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information to CA_Privacy@Hilton.com. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.

We take reasonable measures to: (i) protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, and (ii) keep personal information accurate and up-to-date as appropriate.

We require third parties with whom we share personal information to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of personal information.
