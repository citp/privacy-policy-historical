At Friends of Hillary, we are putting forth every effort to ensure the privacy and security of information that you share with us online. We urge you to take steps also to protect the privacy of your personal information, such as safeguarding your passwords and logging off of the website after submitting personal information. If you have broadband access to the Internet, we strongly advise you to use a firewall.  
Our privacy policy explains the information practices we use at HillaryClinton.com:

  * How we protect your information 
  * How we use your information 
  * How to contact us about privacy 



**How do we protect your information?**  
Our website has a number of security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Our computer systems have restricted access limited only to those persons and organizations necessary to its proper functioning. This access applies to all electronic and physical security measures. Highly sensitive data including credit card information is additionally secured through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Our servers are located in a locked, secure environment.  
**How do we use the information you provide?**  
We are required by federal law to collect and report to the Federal Election Commission the name, mailing address, occupation and employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in an election cycle. These records are available to the public. However, they cannot be used by other organizations for fundraising. We also make a note of your telephone number and email address, which helps us to contact you quickly if follow-up on your contribution is necessary under Federal election law. For additional information, visit the FEC website at http://www.fec.gov.   
We may also use the information that you provide online to contact you for other purposes or to solicit you for contributions. When you register or sign-up online, we may share your contact information with successor organizations and other like-minded Democratic candidates and organizations, and they may contact you. When you make a contribution to us, we may also exchange your contributor information with successor organizations and other like-minded Democratic candidates and organizations, and they may solicit you (see below for additional information regarding your contributor information). However, we will not sell or exchange your credit card information to any other third party under any circumstances.

_Information on Children_   
Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13, without express and verifiable parental consent. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested.
