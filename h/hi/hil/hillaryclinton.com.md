# HillaryClinton.com - Privacy Policy

At Friends of Hillary, we are putting forth every effort to ensure the privacy and security of information that you share with us online. We urge you to take steps also to protect the privacy of your personal information, such as safeguarding your passwords and logging off of the website after submitting personal information. If you have broadband access to the Internet, we strongly advise you to use a firewall.

Our privacy policy explains the information practices we use at HillaryClinton.com:

  * How we protect your information 
  * How we use your information 
  * How to contact us about privacy 



### How do we protect your information?

Our website has a number of security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Our computer systems have restricted access limited only to those persons and organizations necessary to its proper functioning. This access applies to all electronic and physical security measures. Highly sensitive data including credit card information is additionally secured through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Our servers are located in a locked, secure environment.

### How do we use the information you provide? 

On registration, sign-up and contribution forms on HillaryClinton.com, we may ask for your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. We may also ask who, if anyone, referred you to the site so that we can credit those who are organizing volunteer support or fundraising for Friends of Hillary.

We will use your e-mail address to provide you news and information about Friends of Hillary. We may also use your zip code and state to send you e-mail messages about upcoming campaign events or activities in your area. 

On occasion, we may also use the information that you provide online to contact you for other purposes or to solicit you for contributions. When you register or sign-up online, we may share your contact information with successor organizations and other like-minded Democratic candidates and organizations, and they may contact you. When you make a contribution to us, we may also exchange your contributor information with successor organizations and other like-minded Democratic candidates and organizations, and they may solicit you (see below for additional information regarding your contributor information). However, we will not sell or exchange your credit card information to any other third party under any circumstances.

_When you contribute money online_

We are required by federal law to collect and report to the Federal Election Commission the name, mailing address, occupation and employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in an election cycle. These records are available to the public. However, they cannot be used by other organizations for fundraising. We also make a note of your telephone number and email address, which helps us to contact you quickly if follow-up on your contribution is necessary under Federal election law. For additional information, visit the FEC website at http://www.fec.gov. 

_When you sign one of our petitions_

When you sign one of our petitions, we treat your name, city, state, and any comments as public information. We may, for example, provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to national leaders, without disclosing email addresses. We may also make comments available to the press and public online, identifying only your city and state.

_When you schedule online events_

When you schedule an event and post it on HillaryClinton.com you have the choice of making your event public or semi-public. Public events will display your name and the address of the event to any visitor browsing the system and allow those users to RSVP online. Semi-public events will display your name and the general area that you define (e.g.,"Elm & Main", or "downtown"), but will not display the specific address. Visitors can requests invitations, and only after those requests are approved by you can they see the address.
