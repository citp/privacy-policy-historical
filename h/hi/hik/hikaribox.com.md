#### How are cookies and other technologies used to collect information?

Cookies are small pieces of information that your Internet browser stores as text files on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers accept cookies by default, but setting your browser to reject cookies or remove them from your hard drive will prevent you from using parts of this Site. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add products to your shopping cart, proceed to checkout or use any of our services that require you to sign in. The Site uses cookies to:  
   * speed up navigation   
   * track site usage  
   * recognize users and user access privileges and preference   
   * enable and track selection and purchase products on this Site, and record your browsing activity and purchases  
   * conduct research and diagnostics to improve our content, products and services  
   * Improve Site security

On this Site and some unaffiliated sites, we display interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our Site, content or services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to your based on information from activities such as purchasing on the Site, visiting sites that contain our content or ads, interacting with our tools or using our payment services. 

Like other online ad networks, we use cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies, which enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our Sites and other sites. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. 

We do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads. 

We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who bought or browsed for classical music). Also, some third-parties may provide us information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising. 

Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the advertisements that appear on our Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

Does LightInTheBox.com ever give out my personal information?

We sell merchandise, not information **— We do not sell, rent, trade, license, or otherwise disclose your personal or financial information to anyone, except in the following specific situations:**

     **Third-party service providers:** Like most online retailers, we sometimes use third-party service providers to perform specific functions on our behalf. Any information disclosed to them is solely to help in their provision of service. For example, we provide your name, shipping address, email and phone number to partners such as DHL and UPS in order to guarantee delivery of your orders, and we may use relevant customer information in order to monitor the quality of the third party’s service. Similarly, we must provide your credit card number to financial services organizations such as credit card processors and issuers in order to process payments. We protect all submissions of your credit card number for authorization with state-of-the-art data encryption. (More on this below in the “How does LightInTheBox.com secure information collected about me?” section.)

**Legal requirement to disclose information:** We may be required to disclose information if subpoenaed, served with a court order or requested by law-enforcement officials conducting investigations, or if we are otherwise required by law to disclose such information. We will also release personal information when necessary to protect our legal rights or enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements. For example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud, or to prevent fraud by users who attempt fraud or other illegal activity on our Site.

**Merger and/or sale of assets:** We do not normally sell, trade or rent personal information   
to other companies in the course of our business. However, it is possible that we might acquire, merge with or be acquired by another company, or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets, in which case your personal information could be disclosed to another company, subject to the Privacy Notice in effect.

**Non-personally identifiable information:** We may share information that does not identify you or any user, such as the number of daily visitors to a particular page, or the size of an order placed on a certain date, with third parties such as advertising partners. 

#### How does LightInTheBox.com secure information collected about me?

This Site incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as:   
     * Safeguarding all financial transactions done through this Site with Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") encryption

     * Working only with third-party service providers who we believe adequately secure all computer hardware.
