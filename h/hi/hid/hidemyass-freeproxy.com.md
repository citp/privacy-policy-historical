# Privacy Policy | Hide My Ass!

We provide many services to help keep you private online. But that means that you must now trust us to manage your privacy. The VPN market’s actually a risky one: whoever’s servers you use can own your entire online life. So it’s important that the VPN provider you choose is a reputable one that you can trust. To earn that trust, we want to be completely transparent about how we manage your data with this privacy policy.

## TL;DR

When it comes to the operation of our VPN service, we do not collect or store your IP address, your DNS requests, your application or online services use, or the websites you visit. 

That’s the short of it, but we encourage you to take the time to read this Privacy Policy carefully before you install our applications, use our service, or browse our website. We describe in much more detail how Privax Limited handles your personal data when you use our services (“Services”). 

## Who are we?

Our website [www.hidemyass.com](https://www.hidemyass.com/) (“our Site”) and services are operated by Privax Limited, which is a limited company registered in England under company registration number 07207304, with our registered office at 110 High Holborn, London, WC1V 6JS, United Kingdom (referred to as "we," "us," "our," or “HMA!”).

## 1\. Personal Data Collection and Use

Personal data is understood as any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, and includes the information you provide to us while using our services.

Generally speaking, we collect your personal data when you access the websites or use the services related to Privax or its brand HideMyAss!, including www.hidemyass.com, or contact us regarding our services. We process your personal data in order to provide you our products and services, to send you direct marketing, optimize and improve our products and services, and to comply with our legal obligations. The legal bases we rely on are contractual and service necessity, legitimate interests, and compliance with legal obligations. 

More specifically, we may collect and process data about you in the following situations:

### 1.1 Account Creation and Management 

If you create an account with us (note: this is necessary in order for you to use some of our applications or some of their functions), we will need some information about you. This is the data that is created and stored for the management of your account: 

Account data |  What we use it for  
---|---  
Email address | To send you purchase receipts, communications, and occasional product news  
Username | To manage your account and facilitate your login into the service   
License Key | To activate your subscription   
Subscription renewal date | To tell us until when the account is valid  
Trial User | To add a trial period before the account is charged  
  
All of the above data is stored for as long as you use our service, as it is necessary for us to provide it. You can see all of this data by logging into our [Privacy Preference portal.](http://www.hidemyass.com/gdpr)

### 1.2 Service Data from our VPN Servers

If you use our VPN service, we strictly collect the minimum amount of information needed to provide and operate our VPN service, as well as keep it running safely and efficiently. This is the data we collect to make sure our VPN infrastructure works (“Service Data”):

Service Data  | What we use it for  
---|---  
Timestamps of your connections  | To manage the number of concurrent active connections, and handle abuse. 

Example: We use them to stop brute force password cracking attempts on user accounts.  
  
The subnet of your originating IP address.

E.g. We anonymize the last octet to protect your privacy: 92.143.234.000 We don’t collect exact IP addresses that could ID you. 

| To plan for increased network demand and capacity. 

Example: Help us decide to add servers in a region if we see a rise in demand there, or help troubleshoot issues with a specific ISP.   
  
IP address of the HMA server you’re using. |  IP address of the HMA server you’re using. To troubleshoot our service and plan for new network capacity. 

Example: Identify when an IP address suddenly doesn’t work for accessing certain services, and act to resolve the issue.   
  
Amount of data transmitted

E.G. 5GB up or down 

| To plan for new network capacity and server improvements. 

Example: We may deploy more capacity to meet demand and make sure speeds stay up for all users.  
  
**We store this data on servers for 30 days** , after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis — so data created on Jan 3rd gets deleted on February 2nd, for example.

Note: if you are using an older version of HMA (version 3.5 or below) our clients are configured to collect your username. While we have set our servers to immediately dump this information, this is still a potential risk to your privacy. Unfortunately, the only way to resolve this is to upgrade your client to the latest versions.

### 1.3 Data we don’t collect on our VPN service. Period

We do not collect, store or log any of the following data:

  * Any complete originating IP address that could identify you.
  * Any DNS queries while connected. We rely on our own secure DNS servers, so your queries are also protected from exposure to 3rd parties.
  * Any activity logs: the applications you use, the services you use, the websites you connect to — basically anything you do online.



### 1.4 Service Data from our VPN Clients

In order to make sure our VPN clients do their job properly, we have to know how people, as a whole, interact with them. This means we collect anonymized and aggregated data on interactions taken in the app. None of this data can be used to specifically identify you or what you’re using the VPN service for.

Client Data | What we use it for  
---|---  
OS Version 

E.g. Windows 10

| For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planning 

Example: Which platforms do our users most like to use?  
  
HMA! Pro VPN version 

E.G. HMA for Android version 4.1

| For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planning 

Example: Is our latest update deploying well?   
  
Application Events 

E.g. Turned on auto-connection, Uninstalled, etc. You can opt out of this in the settings. 

| To plan product development 

Example: Is a new client-side feature we introduced popular? Are people uninstalling after our latest release?  
  
Even though it’s anonymized, we still delete this data on a rolling 2-year basis (i.e. data created on Jan 2, 2019, will get deleted on Jan 2, 2021). 

### 1.5 Service Data for the Free HMA Web Proxy

Our Free Web Proxy works differently than our VPN service. Because it is a free and easily accessible service, it is far more exposed to abuse and attack. Therefore, we need to collect a different set of data.

Service data | What we use it for  
---|---  
Your originating IP address | To handle abuse of our service. 

Example: Stop a connection that could expose our servers to damage.   
  
Encoded URLs of the websites you visit | Troubleshoot the proxy 

Example: Help troubleshoot issues with a specific ISP or domain.  
  
Timestamp of your connection | To protect our servers from attackers 

Example: Identify and stop a DDOS attack against our service.  
  
Files accessed on the websites visited via the proxy | To balance the load on our servers and handle abuse. 

Example: Cut off access to illegal content being accessed via our server when notified.   
  
**We only retain the above data for 30 days,** after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis — so data created on Jan 3rd gets deleted on February 2nd, for example. 

### 1.6 Our free HMA for Chrome or HMA for Firefox browser extensions 

If you use the free HMA for Chrome or HMA for Firefox, this is the data that gets collected: 

Service data | What we use it for  
---|---  
Your originating IP address | To prevent attacks on our network. 

Example: If someone attempts to attack our servers, we will cut off the connection.   
  
Domain names | To prevent attacks on our network. 

Example: If someone attempts to use our servers to attack our own infrastructure, we will cut off the connection.   
  
Timestamp of requests | To prevent attacks on our network. 

Example: If someone attempts to attack our servers, we may report the attacker to their ISP or law enforcement.   
  
We delete all of this data **every 30 days** on a rolling basis so data created on Jan 3rd gets deleted on February 2nd, for example.

On the client extension side, we collect aggregated and anonymized data to understand how people are using the extension, troubleshoot it, and plan development. None of this can be used to specifically identify you. 

Client data | What we use it for  
---|---  
User Agent   
E.g.Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14)  | For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planning 

Example: Help us troubleshoot issues with specific configurations.   
  
Application events 

E.g. Uninstalled, used Panic Mode, etc. This is aggregated and anonymized. You can turn this off in the client applications. 

| Product planning. 

Example: Lets us know what features of the U.I. are popular or failing.   
  
Once again, we delete this data after 2 years.

### 1.7 Our other extensions

Our IP Checker and Panic Button extensions don’t collect any data.

### 1.8 Third-party Analytics

To analyze the application events mentioned section 1.4, and understand how our services function, or how stable or successful they are, we rely on our own analytics tools as much as possible. But sometimes, we need to rely on third-party tools that address specific issues in ways we don’t have the ability to replicate. Whenever possible, we anonymize, masque, or in other ways try to limit your exposure. 

Here are the third-party tools we use, how we use them, and their privacy policies: 

**Google Analytics on HMA for Chrome and Firefox extensions**

We use Google Analytics on our HMA for Chrome and Firefox extensions to understand how people interact with our products and how to improve them. We use extensive IP anonymization, IP masking, and other data safeguarding practices to protect your privacy. 

**Google Firebase Analytics on iOS and Android**

Firebase helps us to understand how people interact with certain aspects of our applications. While Firebase normally relies on Android Advertising ID or iOS Identifier for Advertisers, we’ve opted to use our own anonymizing identifiers instead. Therefore it doesn’t contain any information that could personally identify you. 

Still, you can opt out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings. 

**Google Fabric Crashlytics on iOS and Android**

This Google service helps us to improve the application stability, pinpoint things that don’t work, and improve your experience. Its implementation doesn’t contain any information that can personally identify you. 

Both Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are subject to [Google’s privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

**AppsFlyer Analytics on iOS and Android**

AppsFlyer helps us understand how effective our marketing campaigns are by letting us know which ones directed you to us. The data collected here is subject to AppsFlyer’s privacy policy. 

You can opt out of AppsFlyer Analytics in the settings of our applications, or by opting out by following the [instructions in their privacy policy.](https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/)

**Deprecated Analytics**

If you’re still on older versions of our applications, the following analytics are embedded in them. We highly recommend that you upgrade to later versions as they no longer use these:

  * Facebook Analytics on older versions of our Android apps: we used to use this to know how many people opened an app, how much time they spent in it, and other information about how they interacted with them. You can find[ Facebook’s privacy policy here. ](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy)
  * HockeyApp on older versions of our macOS and iOS apps: This was used to do beta distribution, crash reporting, user metrics, feedback, and more. This tool belongs to [ Microsoft and you can find their privacy policy here.](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/PrivacyStatement)

### 1.10 Data collected at payment (Billing Data)

We rely on third-party payment processors to handle your product purchases. You can find out which provider we are working with for the point of purchase (for example our website, an app store, etc) you chose by looking at your transactional email or receipt. 

Their privacy policies will also be listed there. 

These providers may collect a variety of information about you to complete the purchase. All of them are PCI-compliant or the equivalent and are prohibited from using your personal information for anything but facilitating your payment. 

Some of that billing data may be shared with us in order to detect and prevent fraud, help with customer support, or used as a record of your payment for accounting, taxation, and invoicing purposes. This data is what we call “billing data” and it may include your name, address, email address, the product (subscription you purchased) and for how long, and payment information. 

We never collect or store your credit card number. 

On our side, billing data is stored for as long as you continue to use our service, and for up to 10 years after that. If legal obligations change, or we need to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, we may be obliged to keep this data longer than that. 

### 1.11 Data collected when you contact us

**Email**

If you contact us by email, your communication and IP address will be stored for 6 months, unless required by law or other exceptional circumstances. We do this to be to speed up our turn around on support and to follow up. 

**Livechat**

When you use our Livechat functionality, we also store the communication and your IP address for 6 months. Our Livechat functionality is provided by Zopim (a ZenDesk subsidiary), which may also collect some data subject to their [ security policy](https://www.zopim.com/security) and [privacy policy](https://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy/). 

**Phone & other methods**

Phone calls we receive may be recorded for quality control purposes. Whether you’ve contacted us by phone or other methods, we may store your communication for as long as necessary to provide you with services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. 

## 2\. Where and how long we store your personal data

### 2.1 Where we store your data

When you use our service, you may be using servers located in a variety of different countries. However, there is a difference between use and storage. What little information that gets generated by your use of our infrastructure does not get stored outside of our 2 main borders: the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. 

There may be some instances where, as a matter of necessity, we need to transfer data outside of these two jurisdictions. When we process the data within our group, regardless of where we are, we always implement the same level of data protection afforded by the European General Data Protection Regulation to all personal data we process. Where we cooperate with third parties which are involved in data processing, we legally bind any party we deal with to adhere to those high levels of protection with standardized contracts approved by the European Commission, and to ensure your rights are protected in accordance with this privacy policy. 

In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We always strive to protect your data to the maximum extent we can. 

By using the service, you acknowledge this transfer, storing or processing 

### 2.2. How long we store your data

Concerning storage or retention periods, the specific terms applicable to the various types of data used for various purposes are noted in their respective sections. After these periods elapse, we will delete this data and no longer use it for that specific purpose. 

These retention periods may be longer where it is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations or legal orders, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, including in the court of law. 

## 3\. Disclosure of your information

As a rule, we do not disclose any information to other commercial parties, with the following exceptions: 

### 3.1 The Avast Group

As we are part of the Avast Group, information may be shared with members of the Avast Group in order to execute on the provisions of this service, for direct marketing, or to help our product development. In all cases, they are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

### 3.2 Provision of services 

It may be necessary to share some data with select parties to deliver the product or service you require — such as with a payment card provider who we use to process your credit card transaction, or to do perform website analytics. The information that is collected and shared with those parties is outlined above. 

### 3.3 Legal requirements

In the event we are served with valid subpoenas, warrants, or other legal documents (for example, documents concerning the sale of all or part of our business or a merger), or where applicable law compels us to comply, or when we are required to defend the rights or property of the Avast Group, including the security of our products and services, and the personal safety, property, or other rights of our customers and employees — we may share your personal data as collected above. 

### 3.4 Whatever the circumstance 

**“Privax does NOT store the originating IP addresses of our users when connected to our VPN service, and thus cannot identify users when provided the IP address of one of our servers.

We are also completely unable to disclose any information about the applications people use, the services they employ, or the websites they visit while using our VPN. We simply do NOT store this information.” 

**

## 4\. Your Rights

Under the applicable law, you, as a data subject, have certain rights. 

You have the right to:
