        this website (the “Site”).</span> <br>
        <br>
        <span class="subhead">What Information Do We Collect?</span><br>

        <span class="subhead">Special Notification for California Consumers</span><span class="body"><br>
        Effective January 1, 2005, individual consumers who reside in California 
        and have provided their personal information to a Clorox entity may request 
        information about that entity’s disclosures of certain categories 
        of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. 
        Such requests should identify the name of the Clorox entity and must be 
        submitted to Clorox at <a href="mailto:privacy@clorox.com">privacy@clorox.com</a>, 
        or at the following mailing address: </span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="body">The Clorox Company, <br>
            Mail Stop 2334, <br>
            1221 Broadway, <br>

        </blockquote>

      <p><span class="body">Within thirty days of receiving such a request, Clorox 
        will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed 
        by that Clorox entity to third parties for the third parties’ direct 
        marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along 
        with the names and addresses of these third parties. This type of request 
        may be made no more than once per calendar year with regard to a particular 
        Clorox entity. Clorox reserves its right not to respond to requests submitted 
        other than to the email or physical addresses specified in this paragraph.<br>
        .</span> <br>
        <br>
        <span class="subhead">Why Do We Collect This Information?</span><br>
        <span class="body">Purposes for which Clorox may collect personal information 
        online include, but are not limited to: </span></p>
      <span class="body"> 
      <blockquote> <b>Sweepstakes and Contest Entries.</b><br>
        From time to time, Clorox offers sweepstakes, contests and other promotions 
        that require online registration. Persons wishing to participate in those 
        programs are asked to provide some personal information. Some of the information 
        requested for this purpose is optional, but other requested information, 
        such as the individual’s name and email address, is mandatory because 
        it will be needed to identify and notify winners. Also, some contests 
        may require selection of a user ID and password by the individual. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Coupon and Rebate Requests.</b><br>
        Visitors to the Site may be offered the opportunity to apply for rebates 
        or request discount coupons associated with Clorox products. Those visitors 
        may be asked to provide certain personal information such as names, postal 
        addresses and email addresses in connection with those offers. <br>
        <br>
        <b>"Contact Us" and "Write to Us" Features.</b><br>
        Clorox encourages visitors to the Site to contact us with questions and 
        requests. Clorox also offers email news updates for visitors who expressly 
        request that service. Personal information of persons using these features 
        may be collected in order to facilitate our responses to those inquiries. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Product Registration.</b><br>
        Purchasers of certain Clorox products may want to register their purchases 
        online so that they can take advantage of warranties, product updates 
        and other benefits. Purchasers are asked to submit certain personal information 
        such as names, postal addresses and email addresses as part of the product 
        registration process. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Loyalty Program Registration.</b><br>
        Clorox offers various “loyalty” programs that provide benefits 
        to purchasers of Clorox products. The loyalty program online registration 
        process requests personal information concerning the individual who signs 
        up. Participants in loyalty programs also may need to provide personal 
        information in order to redeem program benefits. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Requests for Consumer Brochures and Videos.</b><br>
        Clorox may offer product information, including brochures and videos, 
        through the Site. Persons ordering those materials are asked to provide 
        their name and postal address. </blockquote>
      Purposes for which Clorox may collect other information include: 
      <blockquote> <b>Consumer Surveys.</b><br>
        Clorox sometimes conducts online consumer surveys or asks for information 
        from persons completing online forms. This information, such as household 
        size, past purchases and household income, is provided voluntarily and 
        is never required for participation in a sweepstakes, contest or loyalty 
        program, to register a product or to obtain product information. <br>
        <br>
        <b>"Clickstream" Data. </b><br>
        The Site automatically collects certain data concerning its interactions 
        with visitors that facilitate Site operation, management and planning. 
        Such data may include the IP address of your computer, the date and time 
        of an online request, the type of browser and operating system used by 
        your computer, the time required to download information you requested, 
        and error codes generated while your browser is in contact with the Site. 
      </blockquote>
      </span> <p><span class="subhead">How Do We Use, and When Do We Disclose, 
        the Information We Collect?</span><br>
        <span class="body">Personal information provided by consumers and visitors 
        to our Site is used to fulfill requests and transactions submitted through 
        the Site. For example, Clorox sometimes shares information submitted in 
        connection with sweepstakes, contests, loyalty programs and other programs 
        with vendors that Clorox has retained to administer those and other programs. 
        Clorox may also share certain information with third party organizations 
        for the purpose of processing your credit card transactions. Clorox seeks 
        to restrict third parties’ use of such data to the purposes for 
        which it has been provided and to ensure the third parties do not disclose 
        that information to unauthorized parties. <br>
        <br>
        Clorox does not sell personal information collected on its Site. Clorox 
        may from time to time share your personal information with our affiliates, 
        or with business and promotional partners that offer products or services 
        that we believe will be of interest to you. Clorox also may share other 
        data, collected in connection with consumer surveys and other activities, 
        with consumer research and marketing firms. Clorox will provide personal 
        information to law enforcement authorities and other entities where Clorox 
        determines that such disclosure is required by subpoena, warrant, court 
        order or other applicable law or process. <br>
        <br>
        Although Clorox seeks to require companies with which it does business, 
        and to which personal information is provided, to protect such personal 
        information, Clorox cannot be responsible for third parties’ violations 
        of this Policy or of any other rights of visitors or consumers that use 
        this Site. <br>
        <br>
        Clorox may provide personal information and other information, collected 
        online from visitors and consumers, to a purchaser or successor entity 
        in connection with the sale of Clorox, a subsidiary or affiliate or line 
        of business associated with Clorox, or substantially all of the assets 
        of Clorox or one of its subsidiaries, affiliates or lines of business.</span>

        tags and web beacons, to help us understand which websites our visitors 
        are coming from and what websites they go to when they leave our Site, 
        which parts of the Site are the most popular, and how much time they spend 
        on our Site. We also use cookies and other technologies to facilitate 
        participation in our loyalty programs, as well as to customize your experience 
        and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us. <br>
        <br>
        Also, where specific programs associated with this Site require a user 
        ID and password, you have the option of requesting that we save your user 
        ID and password so that you will not have to reenter that information 
        the next time you access the Site. This function is accomplished by placement 
        of a cookie. Cookies are read only by the server that placed them, and
