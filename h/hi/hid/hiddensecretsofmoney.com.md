We may collect information from you on these Sites in several different ways. We collect information you provide to us when you create an account and register on our Site, request products, services or information from us, participate in customer surveys or other activities on our Site, or otherwise interact with us. Please keep in mind that if you provide information to us from a third-party website or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party website or platform. The information we collect is covered by this privacy policy and the information the third-party website or platform collects is subject to the third-party’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our applications.

We collect information through technology, such as website browser cookies, Flash cookies, advertising or user identifiers provided by the browser or application platform, and web beacons, including when you visit our Sites or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a webpage, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the Sites to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases Sites navigation, and so on. When you return to the website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other websites that depend on cookies.

We currently use cookies to track our Sites traffic in order to enhance our information and your experience on the Site. Although cookies do not give us any personally identifiable information about you, once you choose to give us your personal information on an online form this information may be linked to cookies.

**6\. Security of Your Information.**

We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive a formal written complaint, we will contact the person and/or entity who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities and law enforcement, in order to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.

**7\. Compliance and Cooperation with Regulatory Authorities.**

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we help protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Keep your password safe to help protect your accounts and personal information; it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share it. If you are sharing a computer, you should always log out before leaving our Sites or application to protect access to your information from subsequent users.

**8\. Your Controls and Choices.**

We provide you with the ability to exercise certain controls and choices regarding our collection, use and sharing of your information. In accordance with local law, your controls and choices may include the following:

  * You may correct and update your registration account.
  * You may change your choices for Silver & Gold emails, subscriptions, newsletters and alerts. You may “opt out” of being on our mailing list or receiving future direct mailings from us by indicating your Account Preferences.

Wherever your personal information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information.

**10\. Data Transfers, Storage and Processing.**

The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

**11\. Changes to this Privacy Policy.**

From time to time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy policy. We will provide notice to you if these changes are material and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent when necessary.
