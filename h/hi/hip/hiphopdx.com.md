**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Residents of the State of California, under a provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. 

HipHopDX.com qualifies for the alternative option by allowing you to opt-out or opt in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes as described below. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. 

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send an email request to admin@cherimediagroup.com with the phrase “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject line. The response will be sent to the email address from which the request was received. We will not accept requests via postal mail, the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
