<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Business Transitions</h3>

If as a result of the business transition, the users'  personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different  from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice  consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>

<p>Our  users are given the opportunity to -opt-out- of having their  information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the  point where we ask for information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.&nbsp; We  do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not  they should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>This  Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we,  HipLyrics.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such  other sites.&nbsp; We encourage our users to be aware when they  leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web  site that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This  privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web  site. HipLyrics.com may have co-branding and/or framing relations with  other companies. In this case, you should be familiar with the privacy  policies of both companies, since you may be subject to each of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Surveys &amp; Contests</h3>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.&nbsp; Participation  in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary but the  information collected may be disclosed as per this privacy agreement.&nbsp; The  requested information typically includes contact information (such as  name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip  code).&nbsp; Contact information will be used/shared with the  contest/survey sponsors (if any) to notify the winners and award  prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or  improving the use and satisfaction of this site.&nbsp; Unless  mentioned in this privacy policy, users' personally identifiable  information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior  notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these  surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable  information for any secondary purposes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>
<p>We  may be starting a referral program. If a user elects to use our  referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for  the friend's name and email address.&nbsp; HipLyrics.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.&nbsp; HipLyrics.com  stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time  email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HipLyrics.com  can not be liable for the actions of any -friend- who may give out your  personal information, other than what is permitted in this privacy  policy. Any abuse of this service will lead to suspension or  termination of use of this website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.&nbsp; When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When  our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information  (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is  protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.&nbsp; While  on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom  of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet  Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users  are just -surfing-. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While  we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also  do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.&nbsp; All  of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned  above, is restricted in our offices. We use security protection  software made by Oracle, as well as SQKL query protection.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are  granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL  employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are  in a secure environment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HipLyrics.com  will make every effort to protect your information. However,  HipLyrics.com can't be liable (for any damages whatsoever) for  security breaches that occur outside of HipLyrics.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can contact us here http://www.HipLyrics.com/contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
<p>If  a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code,  phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our  service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate  users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done on  line with HipLyrics.com,or by emailing our Customer Support here http://www.HipLyrics.com/contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>If  we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to  this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem  appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we  collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we  disclose it.&nbsp; We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If,  however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information  in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we  will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or  not we use their information in this different manner.&nbsp; However,  if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or  deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor  will their personal information be used in this new manner.&nbsp; In  addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that  do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will  post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.  In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have  opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes  in our privacy practices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<p>If  users have any questions, disputes or suggestions regarding our privacy  policy, please contact us here http://www.HipLyrics.com/contact</p>
