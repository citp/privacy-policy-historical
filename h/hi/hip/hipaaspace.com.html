</div><h3 id="T8K1D7S3S0">Information we collect and how we use it</h3><div class="section">

<p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Information you provide</b> - When you sign up for a HIPAA Space Account or other HIPAA Space service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your email address and an account password). For paid services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we <b>DO NOT</b> keep on our servers. Each time you need to provide payment you are forwarded to authorized retailer of our services - <a href="http://www.2checkout.com">2Checkout Inc.</a>, 2Checkout's privacy policy is available <a href="https://www2.2checkout.com/documentation/privacy.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. Information is always transmitted in the encrypted form to secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other HIPAA Space services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. </li>

<li><b>Affiliated sites</b> - We offer some of our services in connection with other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to HIPAA Space in order to deliver the service. We process such information in accordance with this Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. This rule does not apply in the opposite way - we <b>NEVER</b> ship any of the personal information to the affiliate sites.</li>
<li><b>Links</b> - HIPAA Space may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising.</li>
<li><b>Other sites</b> - This Privacy Policy applies to web sites and services that are owned and operated by HIPAA Space. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. HIPAA Space does not control this and does not take any responsibility in these regards.</li>
</ul>

<p>HIPAA Space only processes personal information for the purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li>
<li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and</li>
<li>Developing new services.</li>
</ul>

</div><h3 id="D3N3Q5T0W9">Choices for personal information</h3><div class="section">
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information.  If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.
</p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.
</p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case HIPAA Space may not be able to provide those services to you.
</p>
</div><h3 id="B3B7S5K5X3">Information sharing</h3><div class="section">

<p>HIPAA Space only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of HIPAA Space in the following limited circumstances:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
<li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of HIPAA Space, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul>

<p>If HIPAA Space becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
</p>

</div><h3 id="H2B7C5J5Q5">Information security</h3><div class="section">

<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to HIPAA Space employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
</p>
</div><h3 id="K0T2H2Q0N5">Data integrity</h3><div class="section">

<p>HIPAA Space processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
</p>
</div><h3 id="D2L4R4U6K6">Accessing and updating personal information</h3><div class="section">
<p>When you use HIPAA Space services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information.
</p>
</div><h3 id="H1K3T8I7G0">Enforcement</h3><div class="section">

<p>HIPAA Space regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy.
