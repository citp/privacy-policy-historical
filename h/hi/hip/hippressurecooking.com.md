**information we gather**  
what you give us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing your future visits, improving our website, and communicating with you.

For example, you provide information when you search for a something; submit a contact form; register for the website; provide information in your personal profile (or profiles, if you have more than one); communicate with us by phone, email, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire; post in the forums; leave feedback on a post or use other hip pressure cooking features. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name (or another person’s); content of emails to us; and your email address.

what is automatically recorded: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the hip pressure cooking website.

Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login to hip pressure cooking; email address; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our website, including date and time (how you arrived, navigated through and exited hip pressure cooking); cookie number; and pages you have viewed. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. This information is collected in the interest of making the hip pressure cooking website work better for you.

A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at hip pressure cooking if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. In addition, the United States Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own website, http://www.privacy.ca.gov/. 

information to/from other sources: Third party advertisers may appear on our website from time to time. They may be able to detect that visitors to their website arrived via hip pressure cooking. However, we do not receive any information from these or other outside websites regarding your page views, clicks, purchases or any other information.

**yummy internet cookies  
**Cookies are tiny bits of information that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as your personalized profile.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of hip pressure cooking’s website’s features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

_We will not sell_ , rent, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information from readers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.
