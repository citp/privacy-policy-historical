# Plus Size Lingerie Privacy Policy at Hips & Curves

Your security and privacy are always our top concern. When you place an order we will need your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number and expiration date in order to complete your order. We will never exchange, rent or sell your personal information to any third party. 

We have created this email privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your information. 

If you received a mailing from us, your e-mail address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"), or you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with us. 

We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending e-mails based on your request for information, and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you. 

How can you stop receiving e-mail from us? Each e-mail sent contains an easy, automated way for you to "unsubscribe" or stop receiving email from us. If you wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email. If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that e-mail with your comments to us for review.
