Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

### Links

This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, HipLyrics.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. HipLyrics.com may have co-branding and/or framing relations with other companies. In this case, you should be familiar with the privacy policies of both companies, since you may be subject to each of them.

### Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary but the information collected may be disclosed as per this privacy agreement.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  Contact information will be used/shared with the contest/survey sponsors (if any) to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Unless mentioned in this privacy policy, users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

### Tell-A-Friend

We may be starting a referral program. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  HipLyrics.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  HipLyrics.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

HipLyrics.com can not be liable for the actions of any -friend- who may give out your personal information, other than what is permitted in this privacy policy. Any abuse of this service will lead to suspension or termination of use of this website.

### Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just -surfing-. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. We use security protection software made by Oracle, as well as SQKL query protection. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. 

HipLyrics.com will make every effort to protect your information. However, HipLyrics.com can't be liable (for any damages whatsoever) for security breaches that occur outside of HipLyrics.com.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can contact us here http://www.HipLyrics.com/contact.

### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done on line with HipLyrics.com,or by emailing our Customer Support here http://www.HipLyrics.com/contact.

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.  In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
