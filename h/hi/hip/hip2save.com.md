The third-party advertising and links are made available to our readers as a convenience. Please be aware that Hip2Save is not responsible for the content of third-party advertising and websites, nor are we responsible for the privacy policy or practices of third-parties and their websites. Our Privacy Policy only applies to information we collect from you while you are actively in session with Hip2Save.

**Third-Party Services**

From time to time, we may engage third-parties to assist in providing marketing, back-end, programming and support services. These third-parties will only have access to information to the extent necessary to provide such services.

**No Disclosure of Personal Information**

Except as specified above, we do not intend to disclose any personal information about you to any third-party without prior consent unless we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) complete your transaction; (ii) comply with legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (iii) protect and defend our rights or property; and (iv) enforce the terms and conditions on Hip2Save. We may provide certain information in aggregate form collected from you, and relating to you, to third-parties. However, we will not provide any personally identifying information.

We have no control over who reads your postings, or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information or comments.

**Business Transfer**

We intend to keep doing what we do for you. Although we have no plans to transfer Hip2Save, if that were to happen, we may share your information in a business transfer. As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would perhaps acquire the information we maintain, including personally identifiable information and Personal Data.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised Privacy Policy in the “Privacy Policy” section of the website. The revised Privacy Policy is effective immediately when posted on Hip2Save. It is the responsibility of each user to review the website and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any revisions to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the website after the effectiveness of such revisions will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.
