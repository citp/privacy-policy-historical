			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p align="left"><strong>(Updated on May 23, 2008)</strong><br>
			  This is the Privacy Policy governing your use of the Himfr.com  Site. By using this Site, you consent to our Privacy Policy set out below. All  terms not defined in this document have the meanings ascribed to them in the  Terms of Use Agreement between you and Himfr.com which by use of this Site you  agree to accept. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>The Information We Collect </strong><br>
			  Registration Information: At the time you register to  become a Registered User of the Site, you will be asked to complete a  registration form which requires you provide information such as your name,  address, phone/fax number, email address and other personal information as well  as information about your business ("<strong>Registration Information.</strong>") <br>
			  Publishing Information: If you submit any information to Himfr.com to be  published on the Site through the publishing tools, including but not limited  to Company Profile, Product Catalog, Trade Leads and any discussion forum, then  you are deemed to have given consent to the publication of such information  ("<strong>Publishing Information</strong>"). <br>
			  Payment Information: If you establish a credit account with us or our  providers or if you purchase a product or service from Himfr.com or a vendor  available through Himfr.com, we may collect additional information, including  billing information, credit card numbers and expiration dates and tracking  information from cheques or money orders ("<strong>Payment Information</strong>"). <br>
			  Statistical Information: In addition, we gather aggregate statistical  information about our Site and Users, such as IP addresses, browser software,  operating system, pages viewed, number of sessions, unique visitors and so  forth. ("<strong>Statistical Information</strong>"). <br>
			  Registration Information: Publishing Information, Payment Information,  Statistical Information and any information we may collect from you through the  use of cookies (see Section 5 below), or any other means, shall collectively be  referred to as "<strong>Collected Information</strong>".</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>How We May Use Information </strong><br>
			  General: We use your Collected Information to improve our marketing and  promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our  content and product offerings and to customize our Site's content, layout and  service specifically for you. We may use your Collected Information to service  your Account with us, including but not limited to investigating problems,  resolving disputes and enforcing agreements with us. We do not sell, rent,  trade or exchange any personally-identifying information of our Users. We may  share certain aggregate information based on analysis of Collected Information  with our partners, customers, advertisers or potential Users. We may use your  Collected Information to execute marketing campaigns, promotions or advertising  messages on behalf of third parties; however, in these circumstances, your  Collected Information will not be disclosed to such third parties unless you  respond to the marketing, promotion or advertising message.<br>
			  Registration Information: We may use your Registration Information to  provide services that you request or to contact you regarding additional  services about which Himfr.com determines that you might be interested.  Specifically, we may use your email address, mailing address, phone number or  fax number to contact you regarding notices, surveys, product alerts, new  service or product offerings and communications relevant to your use of our  Site. We may generate reports and analysis based on the Registration  Information for internal analysis, monitoring and marketing decisions. <br>
			  Publishing Information: All of your Publishing Information will be  publicly available on the Site and therefore accessible by any internet user.  Any Publishing Information that you disclose to Himfr.com becomes public  information and you relinquish any proprietary rights (including but not  limited to the rights of confidentiality and copyrights) in such information.  You should exercise caution when deciding to include personal or proprietary  information in the Publishing Information that you submit to us. <br>
			  Payment Information: Himfr.com will share your Payment Information with  banks or vendors relevant to the transaction in order to enable transactions to  be completed. In addition, Himfr.com may use Payment Information to determine  your credit-worthiness and, in the process of such determination, Himfr.com may  make such Payment Information available to banks or credit agencies. Any credit  card information that you provide through the Site is directly submitted to a  payment server of the credit card processing bank. Himfr.com does not maintain  electronic or physical copies of your credit card information. While Himfr.com  has in place up-to-date technology and internal procedures to guard your  Payment Information against intruders, there is no guarantee that such technology  or procedure can eliminate all of the risks of theft, loss or mis-use. Himfr.com  shall not be liable to you or any other person for any damages that might  result from unauthorized use, publication, disclosure or any other mis-use of  Payment Information, including credit card information.<br>
			  Statistical Information: We use Statistical Information to help diagnose  problems with and maintain our computer servers, to manage our Site, and to  enhance our Site and services based on the usage pattern data we receive. We  may generate reports and analysis based on the Statistical Information for  internal analysis, monitoring and marketing decisions. We may provide  Statistical Information to third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide  personally-identifying information without your permission.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong><br>
			  We reserve the right to disclose your Collected Information to relevant  authorities where we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary  to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be  infringing or threatening to infringe, or who may otherwise be causing injury  to or interference with, the title, rights, interests or property of Himfr.com,  our Users, customers, partners, other web site users or anyone else who could  be harmed by such activities.<br>
			  We also reserve the right to disclose Collected Information in response to  a subpoena or other judicial order or when we reasonably believe that such  disclosure is required by law, regulation or administrative order of any court,  governmental or regulatory authority.<br>
			  If we have reason to believe that a User is in breach of the Terms of User  Agreement or any other agreement with us, then we reserve the right to make  public or otherwise disclose such User's Collected Information in order to  pursue our claim or prevent further injury to Himfr.com or others.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Co-Branded Relationships </strong><br>
			  We have established relationships with other parties to  offer you the benefit of other products and services which we ourselves do not  offer. We offer you access to these other parties either through the use of  hyperlinks to their sites from our Site, or through offering  "co-branded" sites in which both ourselves and these other parties  share the same uniform resource locator, domain name or pages within a domain  name on the Internet. In some cases you may be required to submit information  for purposes of registering or applying for products or services provided by  such third parties or co-branded partners. The privacy policy of such other  parties may differ from ours, and we may not have any control over the  information that you submit to such third parties or co-branded sites. We  therefore encourage you to read that policy before responding to any offers,  products or services provided by such other parties. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
			  We use "cookies" to store specific information about you and  track your visits to our Site. It is not uncommon for websites to use cookies  to enhance identification of their users. A "cookie" is a small  amount of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard  drive. A cookie can be sent to your computer's hard drive only if you access  our Site using the computer. If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie,  each time you use the same computer to access our Site, our web servers will be  notified of your visit to our Site and in turn we may have knowledge of your  visit and the pattern of your usage. Generally, we use cookies to identify you  and enable us to access your Registration Information, Publishing Information  or Payment Information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical  information about usage by Users; research visiting patters and help target  advertisements based on User interests; assist our partners to track User  visits to the Site and process orders; and track progress and participation in  promotions. <br>
			  You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring your  browser's which is installed in the computer you are using to access the Site.  If you desire, you can change those configurations in your browser. By setting  your preferences in the browser, you can accept all cookies, you can be  notified when a cookie is sent, or you can reject all cookies. If you reject  all cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function in your browser, you may  be required to re-enter your information on our Site more often and certain  features of our Site may be unavailable. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Minors</strong><br>
			  The Site and its contents are not intended to be targeted  to minors under applicable law and we do not intend to sell any of our products  or services to minors. However, we have no way of distinguishing the age of  individuals who access our Site and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for  individuals of all ages. If a minor has provided us with personal information without  parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to  remove the information. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Security Measures</strong><br>
			  We employ commercially reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized  access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information. <br>
			  As a Registered User, your Registration Information, Publishing  Information and Payment Information (if any) can be viewed and edited through  your Account which is protected by Password. We recommend that you do not  divulge your Password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your  Password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. If you share  a computer with others, you should not choose to save your log-in information  (e.g., User ID and Password) on the computer. Remember to sign out of your  Account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. <br>
			  No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be  guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while we try to protect your  information, no web site or company, including ourselves, can absolutely ensure  or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so  at your own risk. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy </strong><br>
			  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated  through our posting an amended and restated Privacy Policy on our Site. Our  posting the amended and restated Privacy Policy will make such new Privacy  Policy immediately effective. You agree that all Collected Information (whether  or not collected prior to or after the new policy became effective) will be  governed by the newest Privacy Policy then in effect. If you do not agree to  the new changes in our Privacy Policy, you should contact Himfr.com in writing  (at the address set out in the Notice provision of the Terms of Use Agreement)  and specifically request that Himfr.com return and/or destroy all copies of all  or part of your Collected Information in Himfr.com's possession. This Privacy  Policy was last amended on May 5, 2006. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Correcting Your Information </strong><br>
