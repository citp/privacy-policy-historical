### 1\. Hive and your personal information

At Hive the protection of your personal information is important to us. We respect your privacy and want you to understand what we do with the information we hold about you.

  * **Contact details:** information that allows us to contact you directly such as your name, email address, telephone number and addresses associated with your account or order.
  * **Hive account details:** when you download and use the Hive app, you will be asked to register with us and create an account. Your account details include your user name, password and your contact details, such as your name, address and email address.
  * **Transaction information:** records of the products and services you purchase from us such as the Hive Hub, Hive Active Heating™, Hive Motion Sensor, Hive Window or Door Sensor, Hive Active Plug™, Hive Active Light™ and Hive Live.

  * **Responses to surveys, competitions and promotions:** we keep records of any surveys you respond to or your entry into any competition or promotion we run.
  * **Records of your discussions with our customer support teams:** when you share comments and opinions with us, ask us questions or make a complaint we will keep a record of this. This includes when you send us emails, phone our customer service team or contact us through social media such as through Twitter or our Facebook page. We may also monitor and record our phone calls with you to make sure we are living up to the standards we want, as well as relevant laws and regulations.
  * **How you use Hive products:** we will collect information about how you are using Hive products and services in your home and their performance, what devices are connected to them and how those devices are being used with the Hive products. For example, this includes information that smart devices you connect to your Hive Hub collect about rooms temperatures, temperature settings, heating schedules, lighting use and schedules, when contact sensors show doors or windows are open or closed, water flow events and water temperature and when smartplugs are on or off.
  * **How you use the Hive app and our website:** when you use the Hive app or our website we collect information about the pages you look at and how you use them. 
  * **Location information:** we will collect information about your exact location when you choose to share that with us and motion information from the motion sensors in your Hive products that detect movement in your home. For example, you may set up your Hive app to send you a reminder to turn off your heating when you are out of the house, to do this you will need to share the location of your mobile device with us.
  * Even when you don’t actively share your location with us, your smartphone or computer's IP address may tell us an approximate location when you connect to our website or products but this will be no more precise than the city, state or country you are using your device in.
