## How we store, protect and use information you give us

This privacy policy applies to all personal information we hold about individuals, sole traders and partnerships. It doesn’t apply to information we hold about companies and other organisations.

Hivehome.com is brought to you by British Gas, which is owned by Centrica plc. Centrica plc and its subsidiary companies believe it is important to protect your privacy, and so we are committed to giving you a personalised service that meets your needs in a way that also protects that privacy.

This policy explains how we may collect information about you and then use it to meet your needs. It also explains some of the security measures we take to protect your privacy, as well as giving you information about things that we won’t do.

When we first ask you for your personal information, or when you take a new service or product from us, we will give you the opportunity to tell us if you do or do not want to receive information from us about other services or products. You can normally do this by ticking a box on an application form or contract. You may change your mind at any time by emailing us at the address below.

### 1\. Using your personal information

1.1 We and our agents may use your information to:

  * Provide you with the services you have asked for (which may include loyalty and incentive schemes we may run from time to time).
  * Offer you accounts, services and products from time to time from us or our partners. To help us make these offers we may use an automated scoring system, which also uses information from credit reference agencies, as well as other companies.
  * Help run, and contact you about improving the way we run, any accounts, services and products we have provided before, now or in the future.
  * Create statistics, test computer systems, analyse customer information, create profiles and create marketing opportunities (including using information about what you buy from us and how you pay for it. For example, the amount of gas you use and any discounts we have offered you).
  * Help prevent and detect debt, fraud and loss.
  * Help train our staff.
  * Contact you in any way (including by email, phone, text or multimedia message or other forms of electronic communications (such as a message through your smart meters)) about products and services we and our selected partners are offering.



1.2 We may also monitor and record any communications we have with you, including phone conversations and emails, to make sure we are providing a good service and meeting our regulatory and legal responsibilities.

### 2\. Sources of information

When we contact you, we may use any information we hold about you to do so. So we may contact you by email, phone, text message or other forms of electronic communications (such as using smart meters) or by visiting you. If we are contacting you to tell you about any offers, as far as possible, do so in line with how you have told us you would prefer to receive marketing information (your recorded marketing preferences). You can ask us not to send you any information on our offers at any time by contacting us and giving us your account details.

### 3\. Disclosing information

3.1 We may allow other people and organisations to use information we hold about you (including other Centrica Group companies such as those using the British Gas, Scottish Gas and Dyno Group brands):

  * to provide services you have asked for, which may include providing information to members of your family or household, anyone acting on your behalf or other people who may be interested (such as landlords or letting agents),
  * as part of the process of selling one or more of our businesses,
  * if we have been asked (for example by Ofgem or a lawyer) to provide information for legal or regulatory purposes,
  * as part of current or future legal action,
  * as part of government data-sharing initiatives, for example, those designed to help stop fuel poverty,
  * to help manage any loyalty or rewards schemes.



3.2 From time to time these other people or organisations maybe outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and as a result we may pass your information to countries that do not have the same standards or protection for personal information as the UK.

3.3 If you give us information on behalf of someone else, you confirm you have given them the information set out in this document, and that they have given permission for us to use their personal information in the way we have described in clause 10. If you give us sensitive information about yourself or other people (such as health details or details of any criminal convictions of members of your household), you agree (and confirm that the person the information is about has agreed) that we can use this information in the way set out in this document.

3.4 You are entitled to have a copy of the information we hold on you and to have any inaccurate information corrected. We may charge a small fee for providing a copy of any information we hold about you. For more information about this please contact our Privacy Unit at Lakeside West, 30 The Causeway, Staines, TW18 3BY. Or you can email [CentricaDataProtection@centrica.com](mailto:CentricaDataProtection@centrica.com)
