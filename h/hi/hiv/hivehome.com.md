# Privacy Policy | Hive Home

##### How we’ll use and protect our information about you

This section explains how we use the information we collect about you in your dealings with us – some of which will be classified as sensitive under the Data Protection Act. We’ll meet the standards set out in this clause whether or not you become a customer.

We collect information about you in a number of ways. For example, you might give it to us, we might collect it through our dealings with you, or it might be collected from our devices such as Hive Active Heating™ or smart meters. We might also get it from companies that offer databases of information, like credit-reference agencies.

If we significantly change the information we ask for, or the way we use it, we’ll tell you.

##### How we can use your information

We and our agents can use your information to do the following.

  * Give you the services you’ve asked for, which can include loyalty and incentive programmes.
  * Offer you services, accounts and products, again including loyalty and incentive programmes. We can use an automated scoring system to help us choose what to offer you. That system uses information from credit-reference agencies and other companies.
  * Contact you to ask how we can improve the way we manage your account and provide you with services.
  * Create statistics, test computer systems and do analysis. The information and analysis can include you and your household, your income and your lifestyle. It can also include the way you use energy. We can use our analysis to create profiles and marketing opportunities.
  * Help prevent and detect debt, fraud and loss.
  * Help us keep you, your family and your household healthy, safe and secure.
  * Help us train our staff.
  * Contact you in any way about products and services we (and our selected partners) are offering. This can include by email, phone and text message, as well as any other form of electronic communication (such as through your smart meter if you have one). It can also include visiting you.
  * Your [Hive Active Heating™](https://web.archive.org/products/hive-active-heating) allows us to see when your heating and hot water is switched on or off and at what temperature the thermostat is set. We can use this information to check how the controls on your boiler are working and may contact you, as described above, if we think your system isn’t working as effectively as it might. We will not use the information to contact you about products and services that we or our partners offer unless you have given us permission to do so.



We may also monitor and record our phone calls, conversations and other communications with you to make sure we’re living up to the standards we want, as well as the relevant laws and regulations.

We can use any of our information to contact you. We can contact you by post, email, phone, text message or any other kind of electronic communication (such as through your smart meter if you have one). We can also visit you.

If we contact you to tell you about offers, when possible we’ll do it the way you’ve told us you’d prefer to get marketing information.

If you no longer have an account with us, or if you don’t use our products any more, we can still keep your information. We can then contact you to tell you about offers, from us and other companies, that might interest you.

You can ask us not to tell you about offers – either at all, or just in particular ways – whenever you like. Just get in touch with us and give us your account details.

##### Sharing your information with other organisations

We can let other people and organisations use our information about you. The other organisations include other Centrica group companies, such as those using the British Gas, Scottish Gas and Dyno Group brands.

We and those other people and organisations can use information about you for the following purposes.

  * To provide services you’ve asked for. This can mean giving information to members of your family or household. It could also mean giving information to anyone acting on your behalf, other people who might be interested, or those who introduced you to British Gas (such as a landlord or letting agent).
  * As part of the process of selling one or more of our businesses.
  * To help prevent and detect debt, fraud or loss. This can include giving information about you to a credit-reference agency.
  * To transfer some or all of a debt you have to another organisation.
  * To provide information for legal or regulatory purposes (for example, if Ofgem, another regulator or a lawyer asks for it).
  * In any current or future legal action.
  * To take part in any data-sharing initiatives run by the Government, regulators or the industry (for example, initiatives meant to reduce fuel poverty, where people can’t afford to pay for heating and electricity, or those to help groups of vulnerable customers).
  * To help manage loyalty or reward programmes.



We may sometimes use partners from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), where the laws and regulations on personal information may be less strict than in the UK. Even so, we’ll continue to hold ourselves and our partners to the standards set out in this privacy statement.

##### If you’re giving us information about someone else

If you’re giving us information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that they’ve seen these terms and conditions and given you permission for us to use their information the way we’ve described here.

And if you give us sensitive information about yourself or other people, for example, health details or details of any criminal convictions of members of your household, you also agree and confirm that the person the information is about has agreed, that we can use this information in the way we’ve described here.
