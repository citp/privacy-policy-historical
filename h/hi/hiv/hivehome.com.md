  * **Contact details:** information that allows us to contact you directly such as your name, email address, telephone number and addresses associated with your account or order.
  * **Hive account details:** when you download and use the Hive app, you will be asked to register with us and create an account. Your account details include your user name, password and your contact details, such as your name, address and email address.

  * **Records of your discussions with our customer support teams:** when you share comments and opinions with us, ask us questions or make a complaint we will keep a record of this. This includes when you send us emails, phone our customer service team, use any in-app messaging feature, or contact us through social media such as through Twitter or our Facebook page.
  * **How you use Hive products:** we will collect information about how you are using Hive products and services in your home and their performance, what devices are connected to them and how those devices are being used with the Hive products. For example, this includes information that smart devices you connect to your Hive Hub collect about rooms’ temperatures, temperature settings, heating schedules, lighting use and schedules, when contact sensors show doors or windows are open or closed, when motion sensors detect movement, water flow events and water temperature, when smartplugs are on or off and video and audio recordings from your monitoring devices.

  * **Location information:** we will collect information about your exact location when you choose to share that with us and motion information from the motion sensors in your Hive products that detect movement in your home. For example, you may set up your Hive app to send you a reminder to turn off your heating when you are out of the house, to do this you will need to share the location of your mobile device with us.



Even when you don’t actively share your location with us, your smartphone or computer's IP address may tell us an approximate location when you connect to our website or products but this will be no more precise than the city, county or country you are using your device in.

You are not required to provide any of the personal information described above to us, however, if you do not do so, you may not be able to use our products and services, or the functionality of our products may be reduced.

  * **Our website, app and Hive products:** provide us with information about how you use them and the devices in your home that you connect to them.
  * **Other companies we work with:** provide us with information to help us deliver our products and services to you, and to understand you better. These include:
    * **Companies in the same group of companies as us**
    * **Installers and service engineers:** who will provide us with information about the installation and maintenance of Hive products in your home.
  * **Other companies’ apps and products:** provide us with information when you connect them to Hive products and approve their sharing of personal data with us. For example, when you connect to Amazon Alexa, Google Home or the IFTTT app, we will receive your information about how you use those apps with our Hive products.



### Who we share your personal information with

We share personal information with the following parties:

  * **Companies in the same group of companies as us:** for the purpose of providing a service to you and understanding your use of our products and services.
  * **Other companies’ apps and products:** for the purpose of helping you use apps and products you connect to Hive products. For example, if you have Philips’ Hue products and want to integrate those with Hive, you will be sharing data with Philips — see their privacy notice [here](https://www.philips.co.uk/a-w/privacy-notice.html).

We use GoCardless to process your Direct Debit payments. More information on how GoCardless processes your personal data and your data protection rights, including your right to object, is available [here](https://gocardless.com/legal/privacy/). 
  * **Market research:** occasionally we may ask our market research partners to contact our customers to help us find out how to improve our products and services.
  * **Anyone to whom you give access to your devices:** if you give someone else access to your devices, they will be able to access information about you. If, for example, you give someone access to your Hive cameras, they will be able to see and control them. 
  * **Purchasers of our business:** buyers or perspective buyers who we sell or negotiate to sell our business to.
  * **The Government or our regulators:** where we are required to do so by law or to assist with their investigations or initiatives for the energy industry.
  * **Police and law enforcement:** to assist with the investigation and prevention of crime.



Some of our devices can trigger recordings or actions when certain audio or visual events are detected. If you tell us that the software has mis-identified an audio event, we will give a copy of that audio recording, without any accompanying information about you, to our software provider, Audio Analytic, to help improve their detection system. If you choose to take part in product improvement, we will give all audio recordings to Audio Analytic to improve their detection system, again without any accompanying information about you. 

We do not disclose personal information to anyone else except as set out above. We may provide third parties with aggregate statistical information and analytics about users of our products and services, but we will make sure no one can be identified from this information before we disclose it.

### Direct marketing

In accordance with the marketing preferences you set when creating your account or that you set with us a later date, we may contact you by email, push notification, text, mail or phone with information about products and services we believe you may be interested in.

If you tell us not to email, push notification, text, mail or phone you with direct market we won’t contact you in that way.

You can let us know at any time that you do not wish to receive marketing messages by sending an email to us at [help@hivehome.com](mailto:help@hivehome.com) or contacting the customer service team by phone or by webchat.

### Advertising on other websites and apps

We work with our advertising agencies to show you advertising about our products and services on websites or apps that you visit, at a time and in manner that we feel is relevant to you. To do this, our advertising agencies use anonymised information about the websites, apps, social media content and ads you interact with or view when connected to the Internet, to make sure the advertising you see is more relevant to you.

The techniques our advertising agencies use (to determine what advertising to show you), recognise the device you are using but are not aimed at you as a named individual. Typically, cookies and similar technologies are used to target this type of advertising. You can find out more about cookies and how to manage their use by reading our cookie policy: [hivehome.com/cookies](https://web.archive.org/cookies).

### Service notifications

The Hive app will send service notifications directly to your smartphone or device through the app when we have something important or interesting to make you aware of or you have asked to be notified about certain events relating to your Hive products, e.g. to remind you that your heating is on or when movement is detected in an area of your home.

Depending on the service you choose, you may also receive these notifications by text message or email depending on your preferences.

You can turn off service notifications at any time through the app, your smartphone system settings or your online account.

### Cookies

If you use our website or app, we will collect information about how you interact with us online. We use cookies and other similar technologies to help us do this. You can find out more about cookies and how to manage their use by reading our cookie policy: [hivehome.com/cookies](https://web.archive.org/cookies). 

### Transferring your personal information internationally

The personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the European Union. Some of these jurisdictions require different levels of protection in respect of personal information and, in certain instances, the laws in those countries may be less protective than the jurisdiction you are typically resident in. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is only used in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable European data protection laws and is respected and kept secure. Transfers will be under an agreement which covers the requirements for the transfer of personal data outside the EEA, such as the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses.

### How long we keep personal information

We will keep your personal information for as long as you have an account with us. After you close your account with us we will keep your personal information for a reasonable period to maintain our records and legal obligations to you.
