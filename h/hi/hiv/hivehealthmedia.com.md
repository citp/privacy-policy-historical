# Hive Health Media Privacy Policy

**Hive Health Media** is committed to respecting the privacy concerns of its visitors to the **Hive Health media Network** (“the Websites”). Hive Health Media has created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to establish guidelines that will govern the collection, use, and disclosure of the personal and non-Personal Information of its visitors.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.  These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see:  <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

Hive Health Media collects three kinds of information from the Websites: (1) your voluntarily provided Personal Information; (2) Anonymous Non-Personal Information; and (3) “Cookie” Based Information.

**Personal Information:** Hive Health Media does not automatically collect Personal Information, such as name, residential address, phone number, email address and other personally identifiable information, from its visitors (“Personal Information”). From time to time, Hive Health Media will collect Personal Information that is voluntarily provided by its visitors in filling out contest entry forms and subscribing to newsletters and other activities carried out on the Websites. Hive Health Media will only collect, use and disclose Personal Information after the visitor has voluntarily agreed to such collection, use and disclosure. Hive Health Media also sometimes use email addresses that have been voluntarily provided by its visitors to respond to visitors who communicate with us, to inform winners of contests or to allow subscription to newsletters and other services. All emails from Hive Health Media to its visitors include instructions on how to discontinue receipt of emails, newsletters and other communication from Hive Health Media and visitors can discontinue such communication at any time. Email addresses from visitors who wish to discontinue receipt of Hive Health Media’s emails will be removed from Hive Health Media’s distribution lists. All Personal Information that may identify a visitor and has been collected with the visitor’s consent by Hive Health Media is not disclosed in any identifiable form to any other party outside the company except for the fulfillment of the specific purpose identified to the visitor at the time of collection, or as may be required by law.

Hive Health Media may disclose such information in anonymous, aggregated and non-personally identifiable form to other parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes and to better understand visitor’s use of the Website. At any time, a visitor may send an email to admin@hivehealthmedia.com to request that Personal Information be reviewed, changed, removed or updated in Hive Health Media’s databases.

Visitors should exercise caution when they disclosed personally Personal Information in comments to blog sites, on bulletin boards or chat rooms on the Websites or any other website. Such areas are accessible by anyone and may result in the visitor receiving unsolicited messages from other people and/or companies. Although Hive Health Media is committed to protecting the Personal Information provided to it by its visitors in compliance with this Privacy Policy, it cannot guarantee the security of information, whether personal or otherwise, that visitors disclose online to publicly accessible bulletin boards or chat rooms.
