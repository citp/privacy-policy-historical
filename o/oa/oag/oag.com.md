This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including: (i) personal identification; (ii) to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; (iii) to customize the content of our web site to meet your specific needs; and (iv) to allow us to provide you with those products and/or services.  You may choose to receive occasional updates from us, our affiliated companies (“OAG Aviation Companies”), or companies within our parent company (OAG Aviation Holdings Limited) group (“OAG Group Companies”), about special offers, new products and/or services, other goods and services that we believe may be of interest to you and other noteworthy news items by ‘opting-in when you register.  You may opt out receiving these e-mail messages at any time.  Please see our Opt in/Opt Out policy described below.

**Member profile**

As a member, you can choose to provide travel preferences, credit card billing information, ticket delivery address, travel agency preference and other personal information.  This information is primarily used to assist you in travel planning and booking without having to type in the same information repeatedly.  For example, you can store your mobile device information so that we can notify you of flight schedule changes.

**How do you use my information?**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, our customer, with a customized experience.  This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services.  In order to provide relevant services, we display advertisements.  By knowing a little about you, we are able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and therefore better service, to you.

We carry out research into our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys.  We do this to better understand and serve our users.  This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.  At no point are our users' personal identification information attributed to this research.  We follow the various Codes of Conduct concerning market research practices.  We may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.

**Who will the information be shared with?**

Occasionally, we will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market research surveys and contest entry processing and will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects.  The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement and is to be used solely for completing the specific project.

We may partner with another party to provide other specific services.  When you sign up for these services, we will share your name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.  We do not authorize these parties to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

We may share your information with other companies affiliated with OAG Aviation (OAG Aviation Companies).  In order to share your information with these companies and other third parties, your information may be transferred outside the European Economic Area.

We may also share your information with OAG Group Companies.  In order to share your information with these companies your information may be transferred outside the European Economic Area.

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites.  While we make every effort to protect your information please be aware that we do not control the policies of other sites (including those we may link to).  We have no control over other sites' privacy policies or use of any personal information you or others may share with them.  Please do not assume that our Privacy Policy covers those other sites.

**Opt in/opt out policy**

You are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' or 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our web site or our services at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, we allow you to 'opt-out' of receiving marketing and information from us and to “opt-in” to receiving marketing and information from OAG Aviation Companies and OAG Group Companies regarding product information, promotions, newsletters and research, and also other goods and services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We will use e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers only for the purpose of sending you our, OAG Aviation Companies’ and/or OAG Group Companies’ materials.  You always have the option of opting out as described below.

If you no longer wish to receive promotional materials you may 'opt-out' of receiving these communications by writing to us at the relevant address set out below in the “Contacting Us” section.

You are always notified when your information is being collected.  We do this so you can make an informed choice as to whether you should proceed with the relevant services.

We do not sell or disclose individually-identifiable information obtained on-line about our visitors, to anyone outside of our company other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**How can you access, update, or correct your information?**

If you would like to verify the data we have received from you or make corrections to it, you may contact us by using any of the methods set out in “Contacting Us” below. You can view and/or update your subscription or your personal profile, which includes member registration and travel preferences information, by following the appropriate link on our home page on the relevant website.

You may edit your Account Information and your public Profile at any time by using your ID and password.  If you have forgotten your password, please request a new password via 'My Account' on the website.  For all other problems signing in to our websites, please get in touch with us at your preferred customer services centre.  Details of these can be found on the 'Contact Us' page on the applicable website.

We will try to ensure that the information we obtain and use about customers is accurate.  In doing so we will rely on you to provide us with accurate information about yourself.  You must not divulge your password to anyone.  We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.  Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.  This is to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

As a global company, we have international premises and users all over the world.  When you give us personal information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information, such as to the United States or the United Kingdom, and/or outside the European Economic Area.

**What safeguards are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?**

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any other network can be guaranteed as 100% secure but we have put in place appropriate controls to help guard our database and secure your online information and product purchasing.  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software encrypts the personal data that is transmitted between you and our websites, while security measures including firewalls and strict access control protect the information held by us.

All of our employees are required to acknowledge that they are aware of their personal responsibilities under the applicable national data protection legislation and agree to adhere to it.

**What other information should I know about my privacy?**

'Cookies' are small data files that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.  We only use cookies to track the usage of our websites in order to learn more about your likes and dislikes, which in turn helps us to personalize and improve your experience.  Most people accept cookies but you can configure your browser not to accept cookies if you choose.

'Pixel Tags' are invisible GIF (graphics interchange format) files that we use to track the number of hits a page gets.  This information is used for marketing purposes to understand which campaign ads are most effective.  Pixel tags do not track, or store, any personal information.

In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect our rights or properties when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.

As one of our members, you are in complete control of your travel planning needs.  This includes controlling the use of information you provide to us.  The bottom line is that we respect and will continue to respect the privacy of our customers.
