**What personal information is being gathered by OAG?**

**Member Registration**   
When you enroll for use of products and/or services from OAG, or if you are already a member, we collect specific information such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and password validation. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including: (i) personal identification; (ii) to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; and (iii) to customize the content of our web site to meet your specific needs. You may choose to receive occasional updates from us, or companies within our parent company’s (United Business Media Limited) group (“UBM Group Companies”), about special offers, new products and/or services, and other noteworthy news items by 'opting-in' when you register. You may opt out receiving these e-mail messages at any time. Please see our Opt in/Opt Out policy described below. 

**Member Profile**   
As a member, you can choose to provide travel preferences, credit card billing information, ticket delivery address, travel agency preference and other personal information. This information is primarily used to assist you in travel planning and booking without having to type in the same information repeatedly. For example, you can store your mobile device information so that we can notify you of flight schedule changes.

**How does OAG use my information?**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, our customer, with a customized experience. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services. In order to provide relevant services, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, we are able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and therefore better service, to you. 

We carry out research into our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. At no point are our users' personal identification information attributed to this research. We follow the various Codes of Conduct concerning market research practices. We may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.

**Who will the information be shared with?**

Occasionally, we will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market research surveys and contest entry processing and will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement and is to be used solely for completing the specific project. 

We may partner with another party to provide other specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share your name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. We do not authorize these parties to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

We may share your information with other companies within other OAG companies. In order to share your information with OAG companies and other third parties, your information may be transferred outside the European Economic Area.   
We may also share your information with UBM Group Companies. In order to share your information with these UBM Group Companies your information may be transferred outside the European Economic Area.
