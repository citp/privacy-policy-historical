                   The Information We Gather</strong><br>
                   We collect information about you through two principal means: through  technology (for example, IP addresses and cookies) and through your  voluntary submission of information.
                   <div>&nbsp;</div>
                   <em>1. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</em><br>
                   Using technology, our sites can collect information about the type of  browser you are using, your operating system and your IP address  information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned  to your computer and is recognized by Web technology whenever you are  surfing the Internet. None of this information is considered personally  identifiable information. As technology evolves, additional methods of  information gathering may be used, such as "pixel tags" (also known as  "web beacons" and "clear gifs").
                   <p>We also use cookies and other technologies to collect  non-personally identifiable information for a variety of purposes, such  as to improve the design and content of our website and to enable us to  provide a more personalized experience when you browse the Internet.  Most industry-standard Web browsers have an option that allows you to  turn off all cookies or have your computer inform you each time that a  request to place a cookie is being made. If you turn cookies off (or  refuse to accept a request to place a cookie), you may not have access  to some features on our websites and some of our services, such as  purchasing a cruise or being automatically recognized as a loyalty  member. </p>
                   <p>We may provide aggregate non-personally identifiable  information to third parties (such as marketers, ad-server companies  and advertisers) that make use of general customer data. We may also  share that information with concessionaires aboard our ships and other  third parties. </p>
                   <p>RCCL is not liable for information that is inaccurate due to  technical defects in software used on our websites, whether induced by  our systems or by software provided by third parties. </p>
                   <div>&nbsp;</div>
                   <em>2. Personally Identifiable Information</em><br>
                   You can use the majority of our websites without being required to  divulge any personally identifiable information to us. To participate  in or use some of the activities available on our sites (such as  purchasing a cruise or entering a contest or contacting us) you may be  required to provide certain personally identifiable information (such  as your name and e-mail address). In addition, in connection with some  activities, such as purchasing a cruise, we collect additional  personally identifiable information such as your date of birth, street  and billing address and credit card number.
                   <p>When corresponding with you via e-mail, we may use a variety of  technologies, such as "clear gifs" or "web beacons," to let us know,  among other things, whether you received and opened our e-mail. The  clear gif included in the e-mail may establish a cookie on your system  that further allows us to tailor information to fit your personal  interests.</p>
                   <p>RCCL will not trade, sell or share such personally identifiable  information for use by any third parties unless we have informed you,  been authorized by you or are required by law to do so. In addition,  such personally identifiable information shall not be disclosed to  third parties unless we have informed you, been authorized by you or  are required by law to do so. The term "third parties" does not include  any subsidiaries or affiliates of RCCL, service providers or vendors  acting on RCCL's behalf or travel agents or the purchaser of  substantially all of the assets of RCCL or a subsidiary or affiliate of  RCCL. Our policy is to require that third parties keep that information  confidential. We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable  information, without notice, if we believe that such action is  necessary to defend and protect the rights or property of RCCL and its  family of websites or to protect the personal safety of users of RCCL,  its websites or the public.</p>
                   <p>Your credit card number is used to process your request for products  or services and will not be shared with third parties that are not  involved with the transaction.</p>

                   <strong>How Do I Change My Personally Identifiable Information Or Tell Royal Caribbean That I Don't Want to Be Contacted?</strong><br>
                   Our websites sometimes provide you the opportunity to choose to receive  communications from us when we request information from you. You always  have the option of removing your name from our e-mail mailing list(s)  so that you will not receive further e-mail promotional communications  from us. In order to ensure immediate removal from any list, it is best  to follow the specific instructions outlined within the communications  you receive from us, since we operated numerous sites and e-mail lists.  If you are unable to complete the process indicated in such  communications, <a onclick="javascript:doSecureLink('/customersupport/contactUsOnline.do');return false" href="http://www.royalcaribbean.com/customersupport/contactUsOnline.do" target="_blank">send us an e-mail</a>.

                   <strong>Links and Third Parties</strong><br>
                   Our websites often provide links to resources that we believe may be  useful. These links will lead you to websites operated by third parties  that operate under different privacy policies. We encourage you to  review those privacy policies, as we have no control over information  you may submit to those third parties.
                   <p>Our websites may use third parties, such as ad-server companies,  to present or serve advertisements that you may see on our website. Our  websites may also include advertisements placed by third parties. Our  privacy policy does not cover any information collected by those third  parties nor does it cover how they may use such information.</p>

                   <strong>How Do We Protect Your Information?</strong><br>
                   Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely  important to us. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy  and ensure the correct usage of information, we monitor and adjust our  physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure  the information we collect online.
                   <p>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that data transmitted over the  Internet will always be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect  your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant  the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online  products and services and you do so at your own risk. Upon receipt of  your transmission, we strive to ensure the security of that information  in our systems.</p>

                   None of our websites are targeted at children (minors under thirteen  years of age) and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable  information from children who have not obtained parental consent.
