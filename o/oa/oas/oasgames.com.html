	<h3 class="pageHeader">Privacy Policy of OASIS GAMES LIMITED
	</h3>
	<p>
		<b>OASIS GAMES LIMITED ("OASIS ")</b>&nbsp;is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of its online users ("users" or “user”). This Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") has been crafted to inform users as to the ways OASIS collects, stores, uses, and manages the information users provide during the use of any OASIS game or
		application ("Service"). Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is only applicable to information
		collected by OASIS through the use of the Service.
		<br>By using the Service, users are agreeing to the collection and use of their personal information as
		outlined in this Privacy Policy. OASIS may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and the amendments shall
		be published on OASIS official website. OASIS encourages users to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for
		changes.
	</p>
	
	<div class="block-title"><h5>Information Collected and Used</h5></div>
	<p>
		OASIS’s primary objective in collecting users’ information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable
		users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service.
		<br>When users install any of the OASIS games or applications, it is deemed that users have read and accepted
		the terms and conditions under this Privacy Policy without reservation.
		OASIS may collect and record the information as follows: i. the information collected and recorded according to
		the Policy and Terms of Facebook, (available at: http: //www.facebook.com), or; ii, the information users
		provided voluntarily through the site where the game is hosted or downloaded from.
		<br>The types of personal information collected in accordance with the activities listed above may vary
		depending on the activities. This "personal information" is defined as information about users that can be used
		to contact or identify users. Personal information may include: (1) First name, last name, (2) Information about
		the users’ profile, including without limitation the users’ first, last and user names, and social networking
		site profile ID and icon, (3) email address, (4) phone number, and/or (5) credit or debit card information, or
		other payment details, depending on users’ form of payment. Additionally, OASIS may acquire information from
		users through (1) users’ access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2) users’ email to our
		customer support, and (3) users’ purchase of a virtual product of any type. Please note that because a third
		party manages the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, OASIS does not have access to users’
		payment details and billing information.
		
		<br>OASIS may also invite users to share non-personal information about themselves which may include but is not
		limited to: (1) users’ age or date of birth; (2) users’ gender; (3) information about the hardware users may
		own; (4) users’ favorite websites, friend information and fan pages; and (5) users’ game play information such
		as their highest scores or game session duration (collectively referred to as "non-personal information"). If
		non-personal information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, OASIS may combine
		the users’ non-personal information with their personal information in an attempt to provide the users with a
		better user experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze how our Service is used.
		<br>In addition to information collected as described above, users may choose to share additional information
		about themselves throughout the Service, such as in games or on message boards. Any actions users perform with
		other players are considered public, and are at users’ sole discretion. Any information users provide to OASIS,
		and any information users choose to share about themselves as part of the use of any service, will be stored as
		entered.
		<br>Finally, any time users access the Service, OASIS may collect aggregate information including but not
		limited to internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs,
		platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the
		amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity. OASIS uses this information to
		better tailor the Service to users’ interests, to provide users more efficient customer support, and to overall
		enhance the Service.&nbsp;
		<br>In all cases of data access and collection, the information users provide will not be disclosed, rented,
		leased, loaned, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties except to provide
		products or services users have requested, when OASIS has users’ permission, or under the following
		circumstances:
		<br>Other Disclosure of Users’ Personal Information
		We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals unless one of the following
		circumstances applies:&nbsp;
		<br>I.For legal reasons
		<br>i) Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
		<br>ii) Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
		<br>iii) Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
		<br>iv) Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of OASIS, our users or the public.
		<br>v) Required or permitted by law.&nbsp;

		<br>II. For external processing
		<br>i) OASIS provides the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with OASIS under
		confidentiality agreements. These companies may use users’ personal information to help OASIS communicate with
		users about offers from OASIS and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent
		right to share this information.
		
		<br>III. For service transferring
		<br>i) In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, customer
		information may be transferred to OASIS's successor or assignee, if permitted by and done in accordance with
		applicable law.&nbsp;
		<br>ii) In cases where the service is transferred or distributed to a third party, the users’ personal
		information shall be transferred to the third party in order to continue service.
			
		<br>IV. With parents’ requirement
		OASIS has a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under the age of 13. Parents
		have the option of allowing OASIS to collect and use their child's information without consenting to OASIS
		sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes.
	</p>
	<div class="block-title"><h5>Cookies</h5></div>
	<p>
		A cookie is a small data file that OASIS transfers to users’ computer’s hard disk, generally to quickly identify
		a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit, such as the user’s preferences or a user’s
		name and password. The Service sends cookies to users’ computers when users access or view content of an OASIS
		game. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to users’ personal information for purposes such as
		improving the quality of our service, tailoring recommendations to users’ interests, and making the Service
		easier to use. Users can disable cookies at any time, although users may no longer be able to access or use
		certain features of the Service.
	</p>
	<div class="block-title"><h5>Links</h5></div>
	<p>
		The Service may contain links to other websites. The fact that the Service links to a website or presents a
		banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that OASIS endorses or authorizes that third party, nor
		is it a representation of our affiliation with that third party. OASIS is in no way responsible for the privacy
		policies of these other websites to which users choose to access from the Service. Please be sure to read the
		privacy policies of those websites when exiting the Service.
	</p>
	<div class="block-title"><h5>Changing or Deleting Users’ Information</h5></div>
	<p>
		Users may review, update, correct or delete any personal information by changing the applicable information in
		their profile page. If users completely delete all this information, the account may become deactivated. If
		users would like OASIS to delete their records in OASIS’s system, please contact OASIS and OASIS will attempt to
		accommodate users’ request if OASIS is not legally obligated to retain the record.
	</p>
	<div class="block-title"><h5>Security</h5></div>
	<p>
		OASIS has put in place suitable technical and organizational measures designed to secure users’ personal
		information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, despite
		implementing these measures OASIS cannot guarantee that the users’ personal information will not be subject to
		any loss. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so OASIS discourages
		users from sending OASIS personal information through these mediums.
	</p>
	<div class="block-title"><h5>Policy Regarding Children</h5></div>
	<p>
		Protecting the users’ privacy (especially for minors) is the basic policy of OASIS. Users who are children shall
		use the OASIS service or play OASIS games with their parents’ consent. And the parents shall determine whether
		the service is suitable for their children or not using their own discretion. The Service is not geared toward
		children under the age of 13 and OASIS does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the
		age of 13. If users are under 13, they may use and access OASIS’s game only with the involvement of a parent or
		guardian. If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to OASIS, he or she can
		contact us through e-mail listed below. If OASIS learns that a child under 13 has provided OASIS with personal
		information, OASIS will delete such information from its files as quickly as possible. OASIS recognizes the
		importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourages parents to check and monitor their children's
		use of online activities regularly.
