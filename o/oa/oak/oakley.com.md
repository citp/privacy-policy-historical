# OAKLEY - PRIVACY & SECURITY - PRIVACY POLICY

Oakley's privacy and security measures are designed with deep bunker security in mind, so any personal information that you provide to Oakley is used for the purpose of personalizing and enhancing your web experience with Oakley, and for no other purpose. Oakley's specific privacy policies are outlined below. 

The Information We Collect  
There are three ways that Oakley obtains information from you: (1) via registration on Oakley's website; (2) from an on-line purchase; or (3) from warranty cards that you fill out and send to Oakley after a purchase. 

How We Use The Information  
The information obtained from registration on-line is utilized to improve your web experience with Oakley by enabling you to obtain a faster checkout for purchases and/or to receive occasional e-mails which provide you with the latest and greatest information regarding Oakley and its products.

The information we ask for when you order on-line is your name, address, phone number, credit card number and email address, and is used only to complete the order, to confirm the order and to confirm shipment of the order. You may, upon placement of an order, opt to allow Oakley to save the information for a speedier checkout process the next time. This information is then stored only for the purposes of faster checkout and is not used for any other purpose. Oakley, may, however, send a one time follow-up e-mail to you to see if you are interested in becoming a registered visitor to the Oakley web site. If you choose not to register, Oakley will not pester you again. 

Information taken from warranty cards is utilized to assist you in the event that you need to make a warranty claim. Oakley also uses this information to better understand its consumer base in order to continue to provide superior service.

Oakley does not otherwise utilize your personal information in any way and never shares or sells your e-mail address or other personal information to other companies. No information is collected about you unless you apply for registration, make an on-line purchase, or send in a warranty card. "Cookies" (small bits of text that your web browser software stores on your computer when you visit certain web sites) are used by Oakley only to allow you to use Oakley's web site in the most efficient manner. 

E-Mail  
Oakley will only send e-mails to you if you ask for them and you can easily unsubscribe at any time you want. Oakley has a company policy not to flood people with e-mail correspondence, but simply gives you periodic information so you can stay up to date on what Oakley is offering. Oakley also uses your e-mail address to confirm your order and to confirm shipment of your order and to respond to any inquiries you make on-line. All e-mails you receive will provide you with information as to how to get off the e-mail mailing list if you so desire. 

Children's Privacy  
Oakley.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Although Oakley does not specifically direct its web site to children, Oakley strives to provide children with as much customer service as possible without violating their privacy rights. For their protection, Oakley asks that anyone 13 years of age or younger not attempt to register with Oakley or otherwise provide Oakley with any personal information without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. 

Access To Your Personal Information  
Oakley will provide you with access to the personal information you provided to Oakley by allowing you to view, update or correct your information. In order to protect your privacy, Oakley takes steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the private information or enabling you to make corrections. Oakley will accomplish this through the use of passwords and personal data. 

Security  
Our web site's bunker security system is armed with a sentry system to monitor activity and prevent any unauthorized disclosure of credit card numbers or other personal information. In addition, we utilize a licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. We use industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. 

Updates to Privacy Information
