Method of Collection of Information  
  
---  
  
Oakwood does not collect personally identifiable information when you browse the Oakwood web sites unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide such information to us.  This means that we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information just because you browse the Oakwood web sites unless you:

  * access the web site from a link in an email that we sent;
  * are a myOakwood, eOakwood or eConnectivity member and log-in to your account; or
  * have created a profile and log-in when you access the web site.



When we do need to collect personally identifiable information from you, we will ask you, your employer, your relocation company or travel agency to voluntarily supply us with the information we need.  For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our properties, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and room preference to process your reservation.  We may collect this information directly from you by telephone, fax, email, at the counter, upon completion of an application or enrollment form, or through your use of our web sites.

Information may also be collected as part of:  (i) fulfilling reservation or information requests, (ii) registering for myOakwood program membership, (iii) submitting a job application, (iv) submitting a credit application, or (v) responding to communications from us (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, or reservation confirmations), (vi) registering for, or responding to a subscription request for our newsletter.  We endeavor to collect information only with your knowledge and with your permission if necessary.

Types Of Information  
  
The types of personally identifiable information that we collect may include your name, home, work and email addresses, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information, date of birth, gender, salary, social security number (in some instances), and lifestyle information such as room preferences, leisure activities, and other information necessary to fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require special room accommodations).

Oakwood may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your use of our web sites, communication preferences, travel habits, aggregated data relative to your stays, and responses to promotional offers and surveys.

You may be offered the choice not to submit your personal information or to decide what communications you want to receive from us.  However, doing so may cause certain transactions to become affected.  For example, not providing a name will prevent the processing of reservations.  
  
**Return to Top**  
  
Use of Information  
  
Oakwood will never sell your information to third parties or allow its use in any manner except with the purpose to ensure and promote the business relationship that you wish to establish with Oakwood.

Oakwood may disclose your information to others with that purpose in the following ways:

  * when we have received your consent to do so;
  * when we communicate with employers, relocation companies, travel agencies, companies or organizations, who have made reservations, agreed to make payments, arranged for discounts, or purchased services on your behalf or if you use our services under a corporate or other commercial account;
  * if you seek to have your rental charges invoiced to your employer or any other third party, we may disclose personally identifiable data about you to that employer or third party and to any companies that assist the third party in processing invoices;
  * when we report to credit card issuers, credit reporting and fraud checking agencies and debt collection agencies;
  * if you choose to do business with us through, or with the assistance of, your employer's or any third party's travel agent, relocation company or other intermediary, we may disclose personally identifiable data about you to the employer or other intermediary to make, modify or cancel a reservation made by or with the assistance of the agent, to respond to questions or comments made by the agent on your behalf, to facilitate any other task that the employer or intermediary advises us that you intend for the agent to fulfill, or that such an agent would, as a matter of industry practice, typically fulfill;
  * in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you services you desire;
  * when companies or service providers that perform business activities on behalf of Oakwood require such information (e.g., credit card processing, customer support services, market research administration or database management services);
  * when a housing complex or other property leaves the Oakwood system and access to your personally identifiable information is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations;
  * in the event Oakwood is merged with or acquired by another company;
  * to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law or court order, and otherwise as we believe is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, to operate our web site properly, or to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our employees, users or others or if you are involved (or are suspected by governmental authorities or our security functions to be involved) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order; or
  * in case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual.



If information is shared as mentioned above, we will limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function.  We may confirm personal information you provide us on applications and forms, or as a resident of one of our communities, with third parties, such as your bank, employer, present mortgage company or landlord, utility providers, government entities, credit agencies, and other businesses where you have an account or a credit card.  Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your personally identifiable information and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.

Consent  
  
As part of our commitment to keep you informed, we may contact you via mail, email, telephone, or by other means to confirm your departure date, ensure your customer satisfaction, notify you of new Oakwood products and services, or upcoming Oakwood special offers, events, enhancements, or other relevant information that may be of interest to you.  You may also receive mailings or other communications from carefully selected partners, such as our referral partners or our customer satisfaction surveyors.  We may offer you the option to decline any or all of these communications by following the directions included in our emails or other communications, or by contacting Oakwood directly.

Oakwood strives to keep all our customers and visitors informed and equally able to take advantage of the benefits offered by Oakwood and its strategic marketing partners.  However, if you reside outside of the United States, certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission before we send you information that you have not requested from us.

In some cases your permission will be implied from the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken.  For example, Oakwood may collect and use personally identifiable information that you volunteer, or behavioral data or information collected in the aggregate.  In addition, your permission will be deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill transactions and services that you request.

Data Transfers Across International Borders  
  
The nature of our business and our operations may require us to transfer your information, including personally identifiable information, to other group companies, properties, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own.  Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, Oakwood will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personally identifiable information is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Statement.

Oakwood recognizes the importance of information security, and is constantly reviewing and enhancing all technical, physical, and logical security rules and procedures.  After information reaches Oakwood, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Oakwood.  All Oakwood owned web sites and servers have security measures in place to help protect your personally identifiable information against loss, misuse, and alteration while under our control.  Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the internet, we safeguard your information using both procedural and technical safeguards, including VeriSign Secure Server ID.  The use of VeriSign's services allows for the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption method used to help protect your data from interception and hacking while in transit.

Web Beacons  
  
Oakwood also uses pixel tags, sometimes called Web beacons, to count how many people visit certain Web pages.  Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain personally identifiable information.  Oakwood may use this information to improve marketing programs and content.

Oakwood and our email service provider also use pixel tags to:

  * Track customer response to Oakwood advertisements and web site content;
  * Determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages.  Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a "coded sensor" in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf.  The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.  This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.  The sensor does not collect or use any other information.  If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor;
  * Know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us; and
  * Allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and web site usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you.
