Access By Children:  
When parents or guardians permit their children to use the internet and other electronic media, they also permit distribution of information. We encourage parents and guardians to participate in and be aware of their children's use of the internet and other electronic media. No information should be provided to Oakwood, or any person or company, by children under the age of majority in their country, state and/or other community without the consent of the parent or guardian. 

Cookies:  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

How Your Information Is Gathered:  
Visitors to Oakwood.com provide various kinds of information. Some visitors submit personal information through our information/reservations forms. Other data such as pages visited, site trends, user movements, broad demographic information, inferred preferences, as well as aggregate site data, are collected through your browser's cookie technology and IP address.

Links  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we at Oakwood Worldwide are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. {top of page}  
  
Notification Of Changes:  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

Preferred Partners:  
Oakwood Corporate Housing requires Preferred Partners to ensure safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of the information we share.  We carefully select these Partners to ensure your privacy and the value of their offers. 

We require the same safeguards for the information received over the Internet as we do for customer information received by telephone and mail. {top of page}Security:  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

We use the [VeriSign Secure Server ID](http://digitalid.verisign.com/server/about/dataSheet.htm) to protect your billing information. Based on the same technology used to protect nuclear missile codes, VeriSign Secure Server IDs provide the strongest security available today. This technology makes it safe to transmit your credit card number over the Internet. 

When our reservation form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing.
