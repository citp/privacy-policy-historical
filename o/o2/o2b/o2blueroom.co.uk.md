**Receiving marketing information**  
If you are an O2 Portal Registered Customer, you may, at any time, change your mind about receiving information from O2 or other companies in the future. If you subsequently decide that you no longer wish to receive information about either our products and services or those of third parties, you can notify us online by clicking on "Edit My Profile" under the heading of "MyO2".  
The 'opt-in' on the website allows you to select whether you receive information from O2 only, and/or from our business partners. You can opt-out of either or both at any time. We take every effort to ensure that any data provided to our business partners, with your permission, is handled with the same attention to privacy as we take. 

5\. Disclosure of your Information  
We may disclose your information to other companies in the O2 Group of companies, including their respective partners, agents and sub contractors, for any of the above purposes. In addition, we may disclose your information as may be required by law, regulation or legal proceedings.

The information you provide to us may be passed to third parties located outside the European Economic Area. Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws. However we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy. Additional terms and conditions may be presented when signing up for specific products and services.

If you choose to receive marketing information from other companies, we will only disclose your personal information to these companies where they have undertaken not to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide information to you or other uses to which you have agreed. If you decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly. You should be aware that if you subsequently give any personal information to another company, the uses to which that information may be put would be determined by that company's privacy policy.

If you are an O2 Portal Registered Customer, any Media Messages you send to an email address, including Media Messages from your phone and messages from the O2 Portal will include your registered portal first name and last name and your phone number which will be displayed in the 'from' field of the email.

**O2 Chat rooms and Opinion Forums**  
You are reminded that chat rooms and opinion forums are for public discussion. Any personal information that you choose to supply when you participate in these discussions are widely accessible. Never reveal any personal information such as your telephone number, postal or email address when you participate in these discussions.

12\. FAQS on other related issues  
a) Location information  
b) How can you avoid receiving SPAM?

**a) Location Information**

Some web and mobile telephone services that you use from your O2 mobile may require us to disclose information about the location of your mobile phone to third parties. By using location-based services such as 'Find My Nearest ATM' or 'Friend Finder', you consent to O2 disclosing your information to third parties required to provide you with the service. The information that we provide to third parties will be an approximate location only.  
However if do not wish your location to be disclosed for some or all services, please call our Location Services Privacy Controller (LSPC) by dialling 1300, free of charge from your O2 mobile (for non-O2 customers, please contact your network provider). If you have contacted the LSPC and decided to withhold your location information you may not be able to access certain services that require this information.

**Location Services Privacy Controller (LSPC)**  
You can control how the location of your mobile is used to provide you with services by dialling the LSPC on 1300, free of charge from your O2 mobile.  
You can choose a location status from the list below by following the voice prompts  
a. You can be found by all location services, including those that allow other user to find you. These services may include those such as "Find a buddy" type services where you and your friends can find each other  
b. You can be found by all location services that you use from your own mobile.  
These services will only locate you each time you use the service, by calling or sending a text message for example  
c. You can be found by all O2 location services but not by services that require your location to be disclosed to any third party services  
You cannot be found by any location services, except by the emergency services in the event that you make an emergency call from your mobile. Link to Glossary

**b) How can you avoid receiving Spam?**

**Think before you give out your e-mail address**  
Try to avoid giving your main e-mail address on web sites, chatrooms, newsgroups or to companies. There are many places online that provide free e-mail accounts. You could set up a separate account to use when signing up to an Internet service, or for online shopping. This way your main e-mail address cannot be "harvested" by spammers. Avoid forwarding chain letters or petitions. These lists of addresses can be used by spammers.

**Never reply to spam**  
This includes the notorious "click here to unsubscribe" trick. While it looks as if you are being given a chance to opt out of receiving further unsolicited e-mail, in fact you will be letting the spammer know that your e-mail address is active, leading to yet more spam being sent. Don't click it - just delete the e-mail.  
You should also avoid trying to spam the spammers, you will end up being blacklisted as a spammer yourself.

**Blocks and Filters**  
Your Webmail has simple spam blocking features already. Have a look for the pages on "spam" or "junk mail" in the 'Help' section of the Webmail service. If you are downloading emails onto your home PC, then email your Internet Service Provider or search their website to find out about spam blocking services they may offer. There are various software programs to help you block spam.
