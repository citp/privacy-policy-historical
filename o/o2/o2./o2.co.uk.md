## Our Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains what personal information we have, how we use it and how you can check and update any personal information we have about you.

Watch our video below to learn more about our Privacy Policy.

### Why do we have your personal information?

We collect information to help us manage your account:

  * To deliver products and services to you (whether we provide them or not)
  * To improve our products and services and develop new ones
  * And to manage our network and help us run and grow our business



We also collect information so we can tell you about our products and services or allow partners we've chosen to tell you directly about their products. The law requires us to keep some information, too.

Sometimes we create and anonymise information so you can't be identified.

### The type of Information we have

Without some of your information, we couldn't do our job (or get better at it.) This includes things like who you are, where you are, and how you're going to pay for your services.

**Who you are, which includes:**

  * Your name, address, gender, age, interests and such.  
You can find these in your MyO2 under **[My Details](https://mymobile.o2.co.uk/mydetails "MyO2")**
  * Your debit or credit card details, bank details and other payment information



**What you use your O2 products and services for**

Your call, text, surfing and billing records (for example) Or any other products from us you use, like our apps - this includes the date and time you use them, how long for, where you use them and how much it costs. We don't look at the content of your messages or listen to your calls (unless you are talking to one of our customer service advisors).

**Where you use our network**

So we can connect you to our network, we need to know your location when you make or receive phone calls, messages or use the internet. We call this network location, it finds you through phone masts nearby and only knows roughly where you are so that we can put calls through or connect you to the Internet.

Your smartphone might have also a Global Positioning System (GPS) location that is used by your phone and certain apps. It's more accurate than network location alone, because it uses satellites. We don't use your GPS location for calls, messages or internet access, generally. It's only if you're using some of our apps, like Priority Moments, that we might collect some of your GPS location information.

**What you do with your O2 account(s)**

This includes things like when and how much you top up and pay your bill or how often and why you access your account with us.

**How you use O2 Money**

For example: what you use O2 Money products and card services for. And what payments and transactions are going through at shops and with our partners.

### How we use your information

We use and analyse your information to keep in touch with you and to supply and improve our products and services. Sometimes we'll aggregate and anonymise this information so you won't be identified as an individual.

In particular this means using your information to:

  * Give you access to parts of the O2 website, like MyO2
  * Sort out a payment, put your order through our system or send you anything you order
  * Get in touch with you (like if we need to tell you about any problems with a service, or help you with any questions you have about our services or products)
  * Keep things secure and prevent crime and fraud
  * Look into any complaints or questions you may raise
  * Check whether you qualify for credit. This is so we can assess and decide on whether we can give you (and members of your household) credit, credit-related services, other similar facilities or insurance.
  * Trace and recover debts, manage credit, detect and prevent fraud and money laundering
  * Recover any money you might owe us
  * Assign your debt to permitted third parties. And look after any credit you might have



Or to:

  * Tell you if we've changed the way a service works. Or tell you about a new service that we think may interest you
  * Check what you're interested in, so we can offer (and develop) products and services you're actually interested in
  * Look at markets. Write reports. Do research and number crunching. And (if the law allows it) look at information about you (including the calls you make, your spending, what you use the internet for and where you are when you do it). As an individual or as a group
  * Send you information about our products and services (or those from chosen third parties we think you'd be interested in).By phone, post, email, text, picture message, online banner advertising, or other ways – unless you opt out
  * Tell you about products and services from other companies we think you'd be interested in, or let chosen third parties tell you directly about their products and services. You can opt out of messages like this too

### How we share your information

To run our business and provide you with our services, we may share your information with others.

This might mean sharing your information with:

  * Our partner companies or agencies and their sub-contractors or prospective partners who help us run our services, for example our [billing](http://www.ibm.com/uk/en "IBM") or [customer service centres](http://www.capita.co.uk/ "Capita")
  * Other companies in the Telefónica Group. This includes, [Telefonica Dynamic Insights](http://dynamicinsights.telefonica.com/479/about-us "Telefonica Dynamic Insights") and their respective partners, agents and sub-contractors
  * Insurance providers when you take out a policy through us
  * Offers we have your permission to send out to you from third parties, such as through [O2 More](http://www.o2more.co.uk/ "O2 More")
  * Products and services, including apps. For example, location information is used by apps like our [Priority Moments](http://www.o2priority.co.uk/moments "Priority Moments") . By agreeing and using them, you're giving us your consent to share your information with other companies who run these services
  * Credit reference and fraud prevention agencies
  * Other communications companies
  * New or prospective owners of Telefónica UK Limited



To comply with legal or regulatory obligations, we might share your information:

  * With any public authority or law enforcement agency (if they ask for it)
  * To comply with law or regulations. Or for possible legal proceedings
  * If you give us personal information that's wrong or we find out (or think) you're responsible for fraud
  * If one of our partners who are processing information for us are compelled to do so by law
  * If there's an emergency and we think you or other people are at risk.

### We keep hold of your information

There are certain reasons we have to keep hold of your information.

We keep information while you're our customer or after you've left us, but only as long as we need it. How long we keep it depends very much on the type of information and purpose. For example, we might need to sort out disagreements, stop fraud and abuse, prove that you had an account with us or follow our legal obligations. Or if the police needs it as evidence. We may also keep information about how you use our products or services.

### Want to check and update your information?

It's your information. Just ask if you want a copy.

**Your personal information**

Go to o2.co.uk and [sign in](https://accounts.o2.co.uk/signin "sign in to My O2") to My O2'(link to: https://accounts.o2.co.uk/signin) to look at your personal information. You can change how we get in touch with you – and your account details – whenever you like.

**Marketing communications**

If you don't want us or our partner companies to send you relevant offers or marketing information, you can opt out anytime via your PC in **My O2** , by clicking on the **My Choices** link in the My Mobile section. These changes can only be made using your PC - you won't be able to see this option if you are accessing My O2 via the app or the mobile website on your phone.

**Your location**

Network location uses our network to find your phone so we can connect your call. If you don't want us to share your network location for some or all of your services, call us on 1300. It's free from your O2 mobile. 

GPS location is different network location. We don't control it, so there's no need to call 1300. GPS is based on satellites and is set up on the mobile phone itself. Look at your phone's settings to configure it.

Please remember, if you choose not to share your location you might not be able to use certain services that need to know where you are in order to work.

**Find out more about your information**

If you want, we can send you the information we have about you. There are a couple of ways to do this and some requests have to be in writing because of legal requirements. Details on how to do this [can be found here](http://www.o2.co.uk/help/everything-else/how-to-get-a-copy-of-the-information-we-store-about-you#qs).

### Important things to know

**The lowdown on cookies**

Any emails or other communications you send over the internet aren't safe unless they've been encrypted. They might go through a few countries before they get to your friend who lives around the corner. That's the nature of the internet.

If someone gets into your emails without your permission, or your personal information is shared publicly, we can't accept responsibility .It's out of our control.

**Pages on o2.co.uk and other companies' sites**

On our website there are pages that are branded with both the O2 name and logo, as well as other companies' names and logos. We, and other companies working with us, look after these pages.

This privacy policy doesn't apply to other companies' sites that you get to through our website. So make sure you've read a company's privacy policy before putting your personal information on their site.

**Companies outside the European Economic Area (EEA)**

We might give your information to other companies based outside the EEA.Like many companies, we may use cloud services from a supplier outside the EEA.

And finally, please note that if you're signing up for our products and services there might be extra terms and conditions to look at.
