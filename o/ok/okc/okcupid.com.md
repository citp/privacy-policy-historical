Your profile includes personal information, such as your personal interests, gender, age, education, occupation and certain relationship preferences. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, may be displayed to other users of the Web Site.

  3. ## Use of Information Obtained by OkCupid

    1. We use personal information to provide the services we offer. Your profile, pictures and user name are displayed in order to facilitate user interaction and for purposes of our matching services. With the exception of inviting friends and certain notifications, a user�s email address is not shared or displayed. Users may communicate using various OkCupid messaging services, including a form of instant messenger, without disclosing their email addresses. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, OkCupid allows users to search for other members using certain profile matching systems and/or specific user names. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in the course of using the service provided by OkCupid and/or participating in any of the public forums available via the Web Site becomes public information; accordingly, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

    2. From time to time, OkCupid or a partner, may sponsor a promotion or contest on the Web Site. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

    3. In cases of suspected abuse or service problems, OkCupid may use an IP address in conjunction with other personally identifiable information to enforce our Terms of Service and/or to protect or troubleshoot this Web Site, its users or others who may be affected.

    4. OkCupid may archive information, including personal information, you provide in the course of using our services and any other aspects of the OkCupid Web site. We store that information on servers that are controlled by us or by third parties who have agreed to comply with our commitments made under this Privacy Policy and with whom we have a contractual relationship. Archived information will not ordinarily be erased unless and until your entire account with OkCupid is deleted, and even then we may retain some or all of your information on back-up files; provided, however, we assume no obligation or guarantee to archive any information and do not warrant that any archived information will later be made available to you.

    5. We may use personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve the services we offer.

    1. OkCupid users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account. For technical reasons, any modifications or deletions which you request may take a short period of time to take effect.

  8. ## Security

    1. OkCupid takes appropriate precautions to protect our users� information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication, we request that you do not send private information to us by email. In addition, as all security measures are subject to possible circumvention, we cannot and do not provide any guarantees regarding the effectiveness of the security we employ or our ability to prevent third parties, acting unlawfully, from obtaining information that you provide to us. If you have any questions about the security of the OkCupid Web Site, please contact us.

    2. OkCupid encourages all users to maintain a pseudonymous identity when using the services provided by OkCupid or any other public aspects of the Web Site. OkCupid cannot ensure that your identity, telephone number, work or home address and other personal identifying or contact information will not be discovered by other users of the Web Site. This is particularly true because your location (within a radius of approximately five miles) will be revealed. It is, of course, more likely that your true identity will be discovered if you post photographs or share other unique identifying information about yourself on public areas of the Web Site.

If we do this, we will post the changes to this policy on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the policy�s effective date.
