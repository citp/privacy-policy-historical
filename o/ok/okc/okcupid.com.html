			<h2>Onward transfer and consent to international processing</h2>

			<p>
				We are a growing corporation with users and operations in multiple countries, including the European Union. We have developed data practices designed to assure information is appropriately protected but we cannot always know where personal information may be accessed or processed. While our primary data centers are in the United States, we may transfer personal information or other information to our offices outside of the United States. In addition, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. If we disclose personal information to a third party or to our employees outside of the United States, we will seek assurances that any information we may provide to them is safeguarded adequately and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable privacy laws.

			<p>
				If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal data, including sensitive data, by OkCupid from your region to countries which do not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in countries in the European Economic Area, including the United States.

			<h2>Third-party websites</h2>
			<p>
				There are a number of places on our Services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Services, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>How you can access and correct your information</h2>
			<p>
				If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on Settings. Applicable privacy laws may allow any individual the right to access and/or request the correction of errors or omissions in his or her personal information that is in our custody or under our control. Our Privacy Officer will assist the individual with the access request. This includes:
				</p><ol>
					<li>identification of personal information under our custody or control; and</li>
					<li>information about how personal information under our control may be or has been used by us.</li>
				</ol>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				We will respond to requests within the time allowed by all applicable privacy laws and will make every effort to respond as accurately and completely as possible. Any corrections made to personal information will be promptly sent to any organization it was disclosed to.
			</p>
			<p>
				In certain exceptional circumstances, we may not be able to provide access to certain personal information it holds about an individual. For security purposes, not all personal information is accessible and amendable by the Privacy Officer. If access or corrections cannot be provided, we will notify the individual making the request within 30 days, in writing, of the reasons for the refusal.
			</p>

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>Data retention</h2>

			<p>
				If you have an online account with us, you may delete or disable your account at any time by visiting the "Settings" page for your account. If you delete or disable your account, we will retain certain data for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Services or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h2>
			<p>
				You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Services because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you register on our Services, you consent to receive email messages from us. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by submitting this request to <a href="mailto:privacy@okcupid.com">privacy@okcupid.com</a>. You may be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. We request a reasonable time to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications, will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our applications may also deliver notifications to your phone or mobile device. You can disable these notifications in your device’s settings in your account under “Settings” or by deleting the relevant application.

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>Advertising Opt-Out</h2>
			<p>
				Some third-party advertising companies with whom we partner may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides information about behavioral advertising practices (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>).
			</p>

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>How we protect your personal information</h2>
			<p>
				We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. We want you to feel confident using our Services to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
			</p>
			<p>
				You agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues, such as security breaches. We may post a notice on our Service if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), please notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@okcupid.com">privacy@okcupid.com</a>.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>Information you provide about yourself while using our service</h2>
			<p>
				We provide areas on our Services where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our <a href="/legal/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>Children's privacy</h2>
			<p>
				Although our Services target a general audience, we restrict the use of our Services to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>No Rights of Third Parties</h2>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Services.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
				We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.

We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we encrypt account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our service providers to serve cookies from our website or application to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.

				We may allow third-parties, including advertising companies, analytics companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements or our website or mobile applications. We do not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your device, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites or other data they have collected. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides information about this behavioral advertising practice (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>).

				<strong>Opting-Out of Advertising Cookies.</strong> You may opt out of our data collection for use by third party ad companies to provide targeted OkCupid.com advertising to you when you visit other sites. Cookies are unique to each device. Therefore, you must opt out separately on all devices you use. If you delete all of your cookies (specifically, the "Opt-Out" cookie), you will have to go through the opt-out process again to reactivate your opted-out status.

			<p>
				Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website. Third parties may use anonymous information about your visits to our site and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
