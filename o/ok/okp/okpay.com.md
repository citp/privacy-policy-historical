## 5\. Sharing Information with OKPAY Users

5.1. To process your payments, we may need to share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified OKPAY users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other OKPAY users who you transact with through OKPAY. Additionally, you can provide to OKPAY users any information about your account by filling in a special form **My Account** -> **Profile** -> **Account** -> **Public Information**.

5.2. If you are buying goods or services and pay through OKPAY, we may also provide the seller with your address to help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the seller’s address so that goods can be returned to the seller.

5.3. We work with merchants to enable them to accept payments from you using OKPAY. In doing so, a merchant may share information about you with us, such as your email address, when you attempt to pay that merchant. We use this information to confirm to that merchant that you are a OKPAY customer and that the merchant should enable OKPAY as a form of payment for your purchase. Also, if you request that we validate your status as an OKPAY customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that merchants you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and OKPAY may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.

5.4. Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through OKPAY, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.

## 6\. Sharing Information with Other Parties

6.1. We may share your personal information with:

  * Members of the OKPAY Inc. corporate family -- to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services.
  * Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
  * Financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product such as the OKPAY credit card where we share information with partner bank to determine whether you should receive pre-approved offers for the OKPAY credit card. These financial institutions may only use this information to market OKPAY-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses.
  * Credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law.
  * Banking partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants (in the event that you meet their criteria which includes having OKPAY close your OKPAY Account due to your breach of the OKPAY Terms of Service).
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when 
    * we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure
    * we need to do so to comply with law
    * we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms of Service.
  * Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.



6.2. OKPAY will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy.

6.3. If you open an OKPAY account directly on a third party website or application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on an OKPAY website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application.

## 7\. Restrict from Sharing your Personal Information

7.1. Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances. However, these laws also state that you cannot restrict other types of sharing. Because we have chosen to refrain from certain types of data sharing, the only type of sharing of your personal information that you may restrict is as follows:   
If you do not want OKPAY to share your personal information with other financial institutions for the purpose of marketing our jointly offered products to you, please log in to your account and uncheck the appropriate box in the **My Account** -> **Profile** -> **Account** -> **Notifications**.
