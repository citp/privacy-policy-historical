**Information Provided by You**

Visitors have the option to voluntarily provide Oklahoma County with additional information through the Oklahoma County web site. Oklahoma County will retain information volunteered by the user, such as e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, registration information, etc. This will be used by the county as a means to communicate with the user if appropriate, and will only be shared with other government agencies if your inquiry relates to that agency or as otherwise required by law. This information will not be shared with outside commercial entities.

Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult and may be subject to public access. If we discover or are otherwise notified that we have received any such information from a child in violation of this policy, we will delete that information. If you believe that Oklahoma County has collected information from or about a child under the age of thirteen, please contact us immediately.
