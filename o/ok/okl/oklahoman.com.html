<div class="under25">
    OPUBCO is committed to providing visitors with a powerful, useful and appropriate on-line experience, while at the same time protecting users from unexpected use of personally identifiable information. Like other web publishers, we collect information from users in order to deliver more effective content and advertising, but only within the limits specified in this policy and by law.<br><br>
    If you have questions about our privacy policy, please click on <a href="http://the-oklahoman.tenderapp.com/">"Contact Us"</a>, and make your inquiry via E-mail.

    <br><br>
    Please keep in mind that if you disclose personally identifiable information through our chat room, message boards or other public on-line forums, this information may be collected and used by others accessing those sites. OPUBCO does not monitor or collect information you disclose inside on-line public forums nor does it accept any liability associated with your voluntary disclosure of same.
    <br><br>
    OPUBCO requests you to review the privacy statements and policies of other websites you choose to link to or from Oklahoman.com, so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and store your information. OPUBCO is not responsible for the privacy statements, policies or content of other websites, including websites you link to or from our co-branded sites. Websites containing co-branding (referencing our name and a third party's name) contain content delivered by the third party and not OPUBCO.
