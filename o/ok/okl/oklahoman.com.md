At certain sites, NewsOK may collect personally identifiable information that you provide, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. At other sites NewsOK collects non-personally identifiable demographic information, such as your zip code, age, interests or gender. Some sites may collect a combination of this information.

For example, we may collect information from: sweepstakes and contest registrations or submissions, voting and polling activities, registration for subscription services related to either the printed or electronic editions of the newspaper or from other interactive areas of our website. In connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you will be asked to provide information, including credit card information, that is necessary to complete a transaction that you have initiated and requested. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by NewsOK, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access time and referring website addresses.

NewsOK does not monitor or collect information you disclose inside on-line public forums **.**

NewsOK is not responsible for the privacy statements, policies or content of other websites, including websites you link to from our co-branded sites. Websites containing co-branding (referencing our name and a third party’s name) contain content delivered by the third party and not NewsOK.
