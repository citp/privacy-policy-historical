If you are not satisfied with our response, we have agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the EU Data Protection Authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles, and to cooperate and comply with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland.

Okta complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Okta has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

Okta has established this Privacy Policy to help you to understand how Okta collects and uses personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy covers the information practices of Web sites that link to this Privacy Policy, including, but not limited to [http://www.okta.com](http://www.okta.com/).

Okta's Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. Okta is not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other Web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.

Okta is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers’ data and user information. Okta has established a privacy policy to help users understand how Okta collects and uses personally identifiable information within the Okta website.

Okta does not collect email addresses from the Okta production service for marketing use. Okta does collect information from individuals (“Visitors”) who visit the Okta Website. This information is collected in accordance with this privacy policy, from sources that include but not limited to content syndication, website registration forms, webinar registration forms and conferences.

Personal Information You Provided to Us. Okta collects information from Visitors to the Okta website. Okta receives and stores any information entered when expressing an interest in obtaining more information about the Okta SSO & IAM Service or registering to use the Service. When expressing an interest in obtaining information about the Services or registering to use the Services on Okta’s website, Okta may require you to provide personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, email address, and any other information necessary for us to provide Visitors with access to the various aspects of the Services (collectively, “Personal Information”). The Personal Information you provided is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the website, customizing the content, and communicating with the Visitors about Okta's Services, including specials and new features.

Personal Information Collected Automatically. As Visitors navigate or interact with Okta's website, Okta may also automatically collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons.

### Other Third Party Tracking

Okta engages third parties, which use web beacons, images, and scripts, to help better manage content on Okta’s website. Okta does not provide Personal Information to the third parties but may tie the information gathered from third party tracking to our Visitors’ Personally Identifiable information for marketing purposes.

  1. **Cookies:**

Okta uses cookies to make interactions with the website easy and meaningful. When a Visitor interacts with the website, Okta's servers send a cookie to the Visitor’s computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify the Visitor. They merely recognize the visitor’s Web browser. Unless the Customer chooses to identify themselves to Okta, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, Okta has no way to associate this cookie data with the Visitor’s Personal Information.

For the website, Okta uses cookies that are session-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from the Visitor’s computer upon closing their browser software or turning off their computer.

Most browsers have an option for turning off cookies, which will prevent their browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of the browser software) allowing the Visitor to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.

Okta's website connects Visitors to third party services, with whom Okta partners with to provide the content. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by Okta’s privacy statement. Okta does not have access or control over these cookies. Okta’s partners use session ID cookies to manage a user's connection to the partner's service.

  2. **Web Beacons:**

Okta uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Visitors’ usage of the website, interaction with emails from Okta, and to operate and improve the website. Web beacons are invisible electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on a Visitors computer, such as (1) cookies, (2) the time a particular website is viewed to the Web beacon, or (3) a description of a website tied to the Web beacon.

  3. **IP Addresses and Browser Information:**

When a Visitor interacts with the website, Okta collects their Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser information and operating system to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Okta uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Visitors navigate the website.

  4. **Other Third Party Tracking:**

Okta engages third parties, which use web beacons, images, and scripts, to help better manage content on Okta's website. Okta does not provide Personal Information to the third parties but may tie the information gathered from third party tracking to our Visitors' Personally Identifiable information for marketing purposes.
