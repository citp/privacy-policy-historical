## Information Collected by Okta

Okta is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers’ data and user information. Okta has established a privacy policy to help users understand how Okta collects and uses personally identifiable information within the Okta website.

Okta does not collect email addresses from the Okta production service for marketing use. Okta does collect information from individuals (“Visitors”) who visit the Okta Website. This information is collected in accordance with this privacy policy, from sources that include but not limited to content syndication, website registration forms, webinar registration forms and conferences.

**Personal Information You Provided to Us.** Okta collects information from Visitors to the Okta website. Okta receives and stores any information entered when expressing an interest in obtaining more information about the Okta SSO & IAM Service or registering to use the Service. When expressing an interest in obtaining information about the Services or registering to use the Services on Okta’s website, Okta may require you to provide personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, email address, and any other information necessary for us to provide Visitors with access to the various aspects of the Services (collectively, “Personal Information”). The Personal Information you provided is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the website, customizing the content, and communicating with the Visitors about Okta's Services, including specials and new features. 

**Personal Information Collected Automatically.** As Visitors navigate or interact with Okta's website, Okta may also automatically collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons. 

  1. **Cookies**

Okta uses cookies to make interactions with the website easy and meaningful. When a Visitor interacts with the website, Okta's servers send a cookie to the Visitor’s computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify the Visitor. They merely recognize the visitor’s Web browser. Unless the Customer chooses to identify themselves to Okta, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, Okta has no way to associate this cookie data with the Visitor’s Personal Information.

For the website, Okta uses cookies that are session-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from the Visitor’s computer upon closing their browser software or turning off their computer. 

Most browsers have an option for turning off cookies, which will prevent their browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of the browser software) allowing the Visitor to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. 

Okta's website connects Visitors to third party services, with whom Okta partners with to provide the content. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by Okta’s privacy statement. Okta does not have access or control over these cookies. Okta’s partners use session ID cookies to manage a user's connection to the partner's service. 

  2. **Web Beacons**

Okta uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Visitors’ usage of the website, interaction with emails from Okta, and to operate and improve the website. Web beacons are invisible electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on a Visitors computer, such as (1) cookies, (2) the time a particular website is viewed to the Web beacon, or (3) a description of a website tied to the Web beacon. 

  3. **IP Addresses and Browser Information**

When a Visitor interacts with the website, Okta collects their Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser information and operating system to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Okta uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Visitors navigate the website. 

  4. **Other Third Party Tracking**

Okta engages third parties, which use web beacons, images, and scripts, to help better manage content on Okta’s website. Okta does not provide Personal Information to the third parties but may tie the information gathered from third party tracking to our Visitors’ Personally Identifiable information for marketing purposes.




## Use of Information Collected

Okta may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on the website in which visitors are asked to choose to participate for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, industry or country). Okta may use the data collected in these contests and promotions to send promotional material about Okta or our partners. Contact information collected from these contests and promotions may be used to administer the contest and notify winners and contact Visitors when necessary.

Except as described in the policy, Okta will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable Personal Information to any third party, without a Visitor’s prior consent. Okta may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise their legal rights or defend against legal claims. Okta may also share such information if they believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Okta may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Services information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no Personal Information.

If Okta is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Visitors will be notified via a prominent notice on Okta’s website of any change in ownership or uses of personal information, as well as any choices a Visitors may have regarding their personal information.
