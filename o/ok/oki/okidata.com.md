Privacy Policy Statement

Oki Data is committed to ensuring the privacy of information provided to us by our customers and visitors. We have developed this privacy statement to provide you with the highest level of assurance of the security and privacy of your information as it pertains to these sites ([ www.okidata.com](http://www.okidata.com/), [ my.okidata.com](http://my.okidata.com/), [ www.myokidata.com](http://www.myokidata.com/) and [ esales.okidata.com](http://esales.okidata.com/)). 

Oki Data offers various opportunities for visitors to provide information on its site. This information can be broken down into two main categories. 

  1. The first is information necessary to complete a transaction or purchase (such as name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information). 
  2. The second type is optional information to help Oki Data understand the needs and desires of its customers, and in return for which Oki Data may provide the user the opportunity to enter contests and drawings, complete surveys, and/or receive promotional offers or special notifications, among other things. (This may include such information as company size, revenue, purchasing needs, opinions, purchase intentions or history, etc.). 



Use of Information

Oki Data may share non-personal, summary information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties (such as web development partners, PR and Marketing agencies, channel partners, logistics/shipping partners, etc.). However, for partners or third parties under contract with Oki Data, any individual customer information provided shall be used only to perform or complete a necessary transaction or function related to the customer's purchase. These transactions or functions shall be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement. Oki Data will not share any individual customer information outside of the contracted partners and third parties mentioned above, without first receiving the individual's prior written approval. In short, Oki Data does not sell registrant information to lists. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. In some cases, Oki Data may use a visitor's personal information to understand overall patterns for site usage, to contact the user for clarification on inaccurate information, or to follow up on a customer service issue. Personal information may include name, address, telephone number, etc. 

When a visitor registers, the visitor will be given the opportunity to select whether or not to be included in the Oki Data mailing list. Inclusion on the mailing list may entitle the user to receive information or updates about special offers, programs, new products and/or services. Choosing not to register means the user will not be able to receive these benefits or this information. 

Links to other Sites

This site may contain links to third party web sites that are hosting services or information under the "okidata.com" domain. Any personal information collected by these third parties will be treated with the same level of privacy and security as that which is collected elsewhere on the Oki Data web site. 

Meanwhile, links to other web sites (outside of the "okidata.com" domain) are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Oki Data of the contents on such third-party web sites. Oki Data has no control over and is not responsible for the content of linked third-party web sites and does not make any representations, guarantees or warranties of any products or services of the third party or the content or accuracy of materials on such third party web sites. If you decide to access linked third party web sites, you do so at your own risk. 

User Control

Customers and visitors who have purchased or registered in the OKI Store at [ www.okidata.com](http://www.okidata.com/) have the ability to change, edit or delete their personal information online by logging in at the [ member login page](http://esales.okidata.com/IWShowMemberPage.process?fromHomePage=). If Oki Data's privacy policies change in the future and the use of a users' personally identifiable information is used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, Oki Data will post a prominent notice on this web site 30 days prior to such changes going into effect. Additionally, if at any time a user wishes to be removed from future mailings, or change any personal information on any area of the Oki Data Web site, they may send email to [ webmaster@okidata.com](mailto:webmaster@okidata.com), [ support@okidata.com](mailto:support@okidata.com). To be removed, type "REMOVE" in the SUBJECT field. To change information, please state existing information and the change requested in the body of the message, or call 1-800-OKIDATA to request the changes be made. 

Oki Data takes every reasonable measure to ensure that the information it gathers from the user is accurate and remains confidential and secure from unauthorized access or use. Oki Data utilizes firewall technology to help ensure the security of your private information. 

Credit Card Information

Due to the financial nature of the information provided in the OKI Store on this site, Oki Data stores credit card information separately from other contact information gathered elsewhere in the site. This is done as an additional measure of securing your financial information. Because of this, a user may be requested to input some personal or contact information more than once. 

Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments the user requests through this service and are not used for marketing, sales or other purposes. All credit card transactions are handled through an encrypted system with a secure online credit card processing company. 

Dispute Resolution

Oki Data will attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the use of personal information. Please address any concerns to [ webmaster@okidata.com](mailto:webmaster@okidata.com) who will respond to you within three (3) business days of receipt. We ask that you provide a short explanation of the situation and a return address or phone number where we can reach you during normal business hours. 

If the Web site has not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact TRUSTe [ http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php](http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php).

Cookies

Netscape provides the following explanation about "cookie" technology. "A 'cookie' is a small piece of information which a web server can store temporarily with your web browser. This is useful for having your browser remember some specific information that the web server can later retrieve. A cookie file is NOT a secret way for a web server to find out everything about you and what you have on your hard drive." See this link "[ http://home.netscape.com/products/security/resources/faq/cookies.html](http://home.netscape.com/products/security/resources/faq/cookies.html)" for further explanation of cookies. 

Oki Data uses cookies to enhance our site and its navigation, in order to customize, **personalize** and enhance the user experience. For example, by using cookies, Oki Data may be able to present information to the user, based on a specific OKI product they have purchased, or be able to provide only specific information the user requests, based on the preferences they previously indicated when registering. In most places, these cookies are tied to your personal information. 

Oki Data also uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [ http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy). 

Log Files

Like most standard Web sites, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are used only to distinguish between OKI company employees and those who are not, and are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called WebTrends that uses log files to analyze user movement and provide general site statistics.
