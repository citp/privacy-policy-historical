**Legal basis for processing your information (EU Members and Subscribers)**

We rely on the following legal reasons for processing your personal data:

  * **Contractual necessity:** We will process your personal data when it is necessary to perform a contract you have entered into, or in order to provide information you have subscribed to receive, or to take steps at your request prior to entry into a contract, or where the processing is relevant to a historic contract or subscription.
  * **Legal obligation:** We will process your personal data when it is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
  * **Legitimate interests:** We will process your personal data when we, or a third party, have a legitimate interest in processing it (e.g. responding to complaints, ensuring our business policies are adhered to, or improving our business by monitoring and recording information relating to our services). We only process for this reason if the legitimate interest is not overridden by your own interests or fundamental rights or freedoms. Please contact us if you would like more information on our, or a third party’s, legitimate interests and the balancing test we use to ensure processing is lawful.
  * **Consent:** in some circumstances, we will ask for your consent to process your data for certain purposes. When we ask you for your consent, we will explain what those purposes are and explain your right to withdraw it. If you do not respond to our request we will assume that you wish any pre-existing consent or basis of processing to remain in place.



We will only use your personal data for the purpose, or purposes, for which we have obtained it. If we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason we will only do so if that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will inform you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required by law.

Please contact us if you would like further information on the lawful basis for any specific data processing activity.

**Sharing your information**

We will share your personal data when:

  * You specifically request it, or it is necessary for us to provide our services and fulfil our contractual obligations to you and/or our clients;
  * We are under a legal or regulatory duty to disclose your information (e.g. money laundering and fraud prevention);
  * As a result of any changes in business ownership or organisation; or,
  * In the course of providing our services to you we believe it is in your best interests to use the products or services of a third party.



Who exactly we share your data with will depend on the nature of the service we are providing but can include:

  * Our auditors;
  * Law enforcement agencies;
  * Public bodies;
  * Other professional advisors or third parties who we instruct in the course of providing our services to you;
  * Our external service suppliers who provide business support services (including IT, security,  data storage);
  * Carefully selected third parties whose products and services we feel you may be interested in;
  * Analytics and search engine providers who assist in improving our website; and,
  * Any other third party you may ask us to share your data with.



If you would rather we did not process your data for these purposes, please send an email to admin@oilprice.com. If you agree to us providing you with third party marketing information, you can always opt out at a later date.

**International transfers**

The information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area ('EEA') that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and restrictions on its use as set out in this policy. However, we will take steps to ensure adequate protections are in place to ensure the security of your information. The EEA comprises the EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. 

If you are a subscriber or member using our services within the EU, we will only transfer data outside the EEA where this is: 

  * done with your informed consent; or
  * necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us or for pre-contractual steps taken at your request; or
  * necessary for the performance of a contract made in your interests between the us and a third party.



**Storage and retention of your personal data**

Your information may be held at our offices or with our external service providers as outlined above. We are committed to the security of your data. All appropriate technological and organisational measures have been put in place to protect your data from unauthorised access. 

How long we retain your personal data for will vary but will be determined in accordance will the following criteria:

  * The length of time necessary to provide the services for which you have subscribed or the period of your membership;
  * Any time limits for establishing or defending legal claims or responding to complaints;
  * Any period necessary to comply with our legal obligations; and,
  * Any period for retention that is recommended by regulators or professional bodies.



Please contact us if you would like further information on the retention period for your personal data.

**Your rights**

You have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether we are processing your personal data and, if we are, to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you. This is known as a ‘data subject request’. You also have the right to ask that we update any information we hold about you that may be incorrect. It is important that the information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. If any of your personal information changes please let us know.

In certain circumstances you have the right to request that we restrict the way in which we process your data, or that we erase all personal information that we hold about you. 

You have the right to **object** to certain types of processing.

We will try our best to comply with any request to restrict, object or erase your personal data, however processing of some data may still be required for legitimate business purposes or to comply with legal obligations. Please note that if you want us to restrict or stop processing your data this may prevent us from providing our services to you.

You have the right to request that we send a copy of your personal data, that you have provided to us, to another organisation for your own purposes (e.g. if you wish to change service provider). This data must be provided in a structured and usable format. This right only applies to personal data processed by way of consent or in pursuant to our contract with you. If you wish us to transfer your personal data please let us know.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. However we may charge a reasonable fee should your request be clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. In order to prevent unauthorised access to information we may ask for proof of identity. We will do our best to respond to your request within one month, however if that is not possible due to the number or complexity of requests we will notify you and keep you updated.

**Your Concerns**

If you wish to raise a concern about how we have handled your personal data please contact us and we will be happy to discuss your concerns. We welcome your views about our website and our privacy policy. If you would like to contact us with any queries or comments please send an email to admin@oilprice.com.

If you are a citizen of the EU, you have the right to raise a concern at any time with the Information Commissioner for the member state in which you reside.

**Your Consent**

By submitting your personal information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. For members and subscribers in the EU, the basis of processing under the General Data Protection Regulation will only be ‘consent’ where this has been sought for a specific purpose.

**Changes to privacy policy**

We keep our privacy policy under regular review. If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. This privacy policy was last updated on 25th May 2018.
