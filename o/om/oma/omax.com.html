This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information the Company may collect and how the Company may use this information.

<br>
Cookies
<br>
<br>

OMAX.com uses cookies to make interactions with the Company's Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company's Web sites, OMAX.com's servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to OMAX.com, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening a support area account, or filling out a Web form, you remain anonymous to the Company.
<br>
<br>

There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
<br>
<br>

If you have chosen to identify yourself to OMAX.com, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into our Support area, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed in your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Service and to process your online downloads and requests. Session cookies are required to use the OMAX.com support area.
<br>
<br>

OMAX.com uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company's Web sites. When you visit the OMAX.com website, a unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser's ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company's Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the OMAX.com support area..
<br>
<br>
