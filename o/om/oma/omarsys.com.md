## Personal data

Under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) personal data is defined as: 

“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.

## How we use your information

This privacy notice tells you how we, XCaliber, will collect and use your personal data for _marketing purposes_

##  Why does XCaliber need to collect and store personal data?

In order for us to provide you with our services, we need to collect personal data for _correspondence purposes._ In any event, we are committed to ensuring that the information we collect, and use is appropriate for this purpose, and does not constitute an invasion of your privacy. 

## Will XCaliber share my personal data with anyone else?

We may pass your personal data on to third-party service providers contracted to XCaliber in the course of dealing with you. Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for purposes that you have consented to. When they no longer need your data to fulfil this service, they will dispose of the details in line with XCaliber’s procedures.

## How will XCaliber use the personal data it collects about me? 

XCaliber will process (collect, store and use) the information you provide in a manner compatible with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We will endeavour to keep your information accurate and up to date, and not keep it for longer than is necessary. How long certain kinds of personal data should be kept may also be governed by specific business-sector requirements and agreed practices. Personal data may be held in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs.

## Under what circumstances will XCaliber contact me?

Our aim is not to be intrusive, and we undertake not to ask irrelevant or unnecessary questions. Moreover, the information you provide will be subject to rigorous measures and procedures to minimise the risk of unauthorised access or disclosure.
