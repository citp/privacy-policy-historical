By providing personal information in connection with a sweepstakes or rewards program, you expressly authorize Omaze to share your name and contact information with both the charity benefiting from such sweepstakes and the entity providing prizes for that sweepstakes and your email address with third parties. You expressly agree that these entities may use the information we provide for marketing purposes. In accordance with California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, we will provide you with an information sharing disclosure once per year that lists any third parties with which we shared your information for marketing purposes along with a description of &nbsp;your rights you under California Civil Code section 1798.83. To receive your information sharing disclosure, email us at privacy@omaze.com. If you want us to stop sharing your email contact information with third parties (if we have your email contact information), you may notify us at service@omaze.com.
