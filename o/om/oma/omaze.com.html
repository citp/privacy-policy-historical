<p>Summary</p>
<p>Although you should read through the Policy for complete information on how we collect, use, share, and secure information, the following provides a summary of some the most important aspects of or our privacy practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with services, including to process donations or payments you make, to improve our services, and to provide you with information on upcoming events, announcements, and sweepstakes.</li>

<p><span>What Information Do We Collect Through The Website?</span></p>
<p>Omaze collects both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. When we refer simply to the term information in this privacy policy we are referring to how the Omaze collects, uses, or shares both the personally identifiable, and non-personally identifiable information that it collects.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information refers to information that is collected in conjunction with your name. Omaze does not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it voluntarily. If you do not want us to collect personally identifiable information about you, you can simply decide not to submit it to us.</p>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information refers to information that Omaze may collect from you that is not collected in conjunction with your name.</p>

<section class="privacy_section">
<p><span>How Do We Use This Information?</span></p>

We may also decide to use information about you to track how you use our site or to help us enhance your online experience, for example, we may access your account information to provide technical support and quality assurance. In addition, we may aggregate the personally identifiable information that you provide with the personally identifiable information that other users provide in order to conduct research, analysis, or studies for our own purposes (<span>i.e</span>., not related to providing you with specific services), including improving our services and future sweepstakes.</p>
<p>We may also use the information that you provide to us to communicate with you about our current activities, future events and sweepstakes or to notify you about any changes to our services.

<section class="privacy_section">
<p><span>How Do We Collect This Information</span></p>

<p><span>Sharing Your Information with Subcontractors</span>. In our efforts to provide the best quality service and experience to you, we may share information with subcontractors that provide us with services. These services may include, among other things, helping to provide services that you request, helping to create or maintain our databases, helping to research and analyze the people who request services information from us, and/or helping to process payment card information.</p>
<p><span>Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law</span>. We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing your personally identifiable information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal processes, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.</p>
<p><span>Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement</span>. We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies or the release of your information may protect the rights, property or safety of Omaze, you, or another person.</p>
<p><span>Business Transition</span>.

<p>California Users: Your California Privacy Rights.</p>
<p>We are in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; Unless you provide personal information in connection with a sweepstakes, we are likely exempt from the requirements of California Civil Code section 1798.83 because we do not share such personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; However, by providing personal information in connection with a sweepstakes or rewards program, you are expressly authorizing Omaze to share your name and contact information with both the charity benefiting from such sweepstakes&nbsp;and the entity providing prizes for that sweepstakes.&nbsp; You expressly agree that these entities may use your information for marketing purposes. If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may notify us in writing at&nbsp;privacy@omaze.com. If you want us to stop sharing your email contact information with third parties (if we have your email contact information), you may notify us at&nbsp;service@omaze.com. In order to fulfil certain rewards and prizes, we must share your information. &nbsp;Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages. If you have opted-out as described above, and thereafter you elect to use a service or promotion that requires us to contact you or share your information with a third party (e.g., you enter into a new sweepstakes after opting-out), then your previous opt-out preferences will not apply.</p>
