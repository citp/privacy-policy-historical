We request personal information from you in order to process online reservations.

This information is used for billing purposes and to reserve a room. If there is a problem with a reservation, the information provided will also allow us to contact you. 

In order to become a member of the Select Guest frequent stay program, you must first complete an enrollment form. During enrollment, new members are required to provide certain contact information. We use this information to create a member profile of your previous and future stays at Omni Hotels and other information for which you've expressed an interest.
