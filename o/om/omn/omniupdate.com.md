# Privacy Policy

OmniUpdate is deeply committed to user privacy and to the security of all data in our possession. The following privacy policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, and delete your information. 

## Information Collection

**Personal information collection when you visit our websites, use OU Campus, and/or use OmniUpdate developed products**

Personal information refers to any information that you voluntarily submit to us that identifies you personally, including contact information such as your name, email address, phone number, company name, address, and any other information about your business or yourself. Personal information can also include information about you that is available on the internet, such as from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Google, or publicly available information that we acquire from service providers. 

OmniUpdate.com, OU Campus, and OmniUpdate developed products utilize Google Analytics and other tools to track and analyze internet visitor usage data, which may include your IP address, geographical location, browser type, domain name(s), internet service provider (ISP), the pages and files viewed on our site, operating system, length of visit, access times, referring website addresses, and web browser cookies. We also may utilize third parties to target advertisements to visitor interest categories. This information is used by OmniUpdate to operate and improve our website, products, and services; to personalize information; and to provide general statistics regarding use and user behavior so that we can continually improve them. In some cases, we do link this automatically-collected data to personal information voluntarily submitted such as name, email address, address, and phone number. 

If credit card information is collected to secure payment for services, such information is not stored by OmniUpdate. Our bank assists in the processing of credit card transactions and all card information is destroyed after the transaction is successfully completed. Payments made via check are processed through private bank means and all checking information is maintained securely in our office and with our bank. Billing information is never used by OmniUpdate for marketing or promotional purposes. 

### Cookies

We use cookies when you visit our websites, use OU Campus, and/or use other OmniUpdate developed products to help us provide you with a good browsing and user experience and it also allows us to improve our site, products, and services. By continuing to browse the site, use OU Campus, and/or use other OmniUpdate developed products, you are agreeing to our use of cookies. 

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. 

We use the following cookies:

  * **Strictly necessary cookies.**  These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website or make use of our products and services. 
  * **Analytical/performance cookies.**  They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users find what they are looking for easily. 
  * **Functionality cookies.**  These are used to recognize you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). 
  * **Targeting cookies.**  These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited, and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose. 



You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them below. 

### Third-party cookies

Our websites, products, and services will set several types of third-party cookies, and we do not control the operation of any of them. The third-party cookies that may be set include: 

  * Google Analytics – We use Google Analytics to collect data about website usage. This data does not include personally identifiable information. View the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). 
  * Google Remarketing – We use Google’s Remarketing cookie to market products and services we think may be of interest to you. You may see our adverts on Google’s Display Advertising Network of partner websites and Google’s own search results pages. We aim to carefully select the products and services we remarket to you and do so based on the pages you have visited on our website. To opt out of Google Remarketing, set your [Google Ad Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). 
  * Zendesk, Inc. – This license cookie enables our installation of Zendesk, making it possible for visitors to use the support chat functionality on our support site. It does not collect any personally identifiable information. Read the [Zendesk Privacy Policy](https://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy/). 
  * LiveChat, Inc. – This license cookie enables our installation of LiveChat, making it possible for visitors to use the LiveChat functionality on this site. It does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information. Read the [LiveChat Privacy Policy](https://www.livechatinc.com/privacy-policy/). 
  * Salesforce Pardot – Pardot tracks visitor and prospect activities on our website and landing pages. Pardot cookies don’t store personally identifying information, only a unique identifier. Read the [Salesforce Pardot Privacy Policy](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/). 
  * VisualVisitor – We use VisualVisitor’s website analytics and tracking tool. This includes collection of IP address, navigational patterns, and placement of two cookies that associate website activity with a device linking sessions and visits. Read the [VisualVisitor Privacy Policy](https://www.visualvisitor.com/legal/privacy-policy/). 
  * Triblio – We use Triblio’s platform to collect data about website usage and to personalize our website. This includes collection of IP address, navigational patterns, and placement of cookies to market products and services that may be of interest to you. Read the [Triblio Privacy Policy](https://triblio.com/privacy-policy/). 
  * FullStory – OmniUpdate uses FullStory to track and understand user behavior within beta and demo environments in service to improving the customer experience. OmniUpdate employees engaged in the design and development of OU Campus can see a rendering of the path the user has taken through the product. FullStory captures your OU Campus user name, full name, gravitar image, IP address, and IP-based geolocation. Where possible, OmniUpdate uses functionality that will blur user data so that employees cannot see it as they watch the FullStory reproductions of the user’s experience. However, the messaging and notifications feature does not support blurring of data, so it is advised that users refrain from including sensitive or personally identifiable data within the subject or body of the messages. Read the [FullStory Privacy Policy](https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy/). 
  * Typeform - OmniUpdate uses a forms tool provided by Typeform to survey our customers for feedback related to improving our products and services. We will never ask for personal information not directly related to the topic on which we’re soliciting feedback, but we often ask for the customer’s name and school affiliation. Additionally, we receive the user’s IP address in the response to the surveys.  Read the [Typeform Privacy and Cookie Policies](https://admin.typeform.com/to/dwk6gt).
  * UserVoice - OmniUpdate uses services provided by UserVoice to support our support chat capabilities. To learn more about the data that UserVoice collects and how they use it, read the [UserVoice Privacy Policy](https://www.uservoice.com/privacy/).
  * SocialEngine - OmniUpdate uses services provided by SocialEngine to support our OmniUpdate Community Network discussion forum that enables our customers to suggest enhancements to OU Campus, vote on the suggestions, and get support from OmniUpdate and peers. To learn more about the data that SocialEngine collects and how they use it, read the [SocialEngine Privacy Policy](https://www.socialengine.com/terms-and-privacy/privacy).
