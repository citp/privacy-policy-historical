# Omniglot Privacy Policy

This privacy policy sets out how Omniglot uses and protects any information that you give Omniglot when you use this website. 

Please note that Omniglot is a one-man operation, and that man is me, Simon Ager. 

Omniglot is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should I ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement. 

Omniglot may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from 7th June 2018. 

## What I collect

I do not collect any personal information about you. However, if you send me an email, this will be saved in my email client. If you contact me via Skype, Facebook, Twitter or Google+, your messages will be saved in those applications. 

## What I do with the information I gather

  * If you make a contribution to Omniglot, such as sending corrections or new material, I will put your name on the relevant page(s), or on the [contributors' page](http://www.omniglot.com/contributors.htm), to acknowledge your contribution. If you prefer to remain anonymous, please [let me know](https://web.archive.org/web/20181220174140id_/http%3A//www.omniglot.com/contact.htm).
  * I occasionally may give your contact details to other visitors to this site who you might be able to help with a language-related question. If you would prefer not be contacted in this way, please [let me know](https://web.archive.org/web/20181220174140id_/http%3A//www.omniglot.com/contact.htm).
  * If you submit an article or a constructed script, I may put your name and email address in a HTML comment at the bottom of the page. This is only visible if you view the source code. If someone else wishes to contact you about the article or script, this helps me remember your details, rather than searching through my email. If you prefer not to be contacted about your article(s), please [let me know](https://web.archive.org/web/20181220174140id_/http%3A//www.omniglot.com/contact.htm).

This website contains links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave Omniglot, you should note that I do not have any control over other websites.
