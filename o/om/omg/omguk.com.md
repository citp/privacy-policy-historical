All profile information and user data is retained only for as long as is required in order for it to be used for its intended purpose. 

## Security of information

OMG takes all reasonable measures to ensure that profile information and user data are stored as securely as possible and not lost, misused or altered. 

OMG’s infrastructure is hosted in an enterprise-level, highly secure data centre with UPS, fire detection and suppression systems with a sophisticated environment management system.

Strong encryption & DH group, short keylife and the latest VPN technologies (PFS,replay detection) ensure the highest level of security.

Access to profile information and user data is restricted to those members of staff who must use it in order to carry out their responsibilities. 

When clients, affiliates or users have been provided with a password that is intended to protect access to their profile or account information, it is their responsibility to keep that password confidential. 

Data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.

Both profile information and user data may be transferred between the subsidiary group companies of Online Media Group, or between subsidiary companies and the holding company, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985 or section 1519 of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable. 

## Cookies

Advertisements served by OMG Network and displayed at affiliate sites may use cookies stored on users’ computers to record information on clicks, leads and sales – in other words, information on:

  * which advertisements users have seen or clicked on
  * which websites they visit before and after viewing a particular advertisement 
  * whether or not they have made a purchase as a result of clicking on a particular advertisement. 



OMG cookies do not include any personally identifiable information and are used purely to track the performance of OMG affiliates, as well as to improve the relevancy (‘targeting’) of served advertisements, for example by making them more closely related to the type of website or web page that a particular user has visited. 

Many web browsers allow users to decline specific cookies (or all cookies) if they wish, without damaging their experience. 

Under the terms of their contracts with OMG, all OMG affiliates are obliged to inform their users of the fact that OMG advertisements hosted on their sites may store cookies to users’ computers, in addition to their statutory privacy and data protection responsibilities. 

OMG has no control over any additional cookies that may be used by its affiliates or clients.
