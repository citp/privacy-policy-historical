<h2>Retention of information</h2>
<p>All profile information and user data is retained only for as long as is required in order for it to be used for its intended purpose. </p>

<p>OMG takes all reasonable measures to ensure that profile information and user data are stored as securely as possible and not lost, misused or altered. </p>
<p>OMG’s infrastructure is hosted in an enterprise-level, highly secure data centre with UPS, fire detection and suppression systems with a sophisticated environment management system.

OMG suppliers are carefully managed to ensure that they comply with all the terms of this privacy policy when storing or processing the data covered by it. </li>
    <li>In the event of a corporate transaction such as the purchase or sale of a business or assets, OMG may disclose aggregate information on users or affiliates to the purchaser or seller involved. </li>
</ul>
