<p>Profile information may be used by OMG for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Retention of information</h2>
<p>All profile information and user data is retained only for as long as is required in order for it to be used for its intended purpose. </p>
<h2>Security of information</h2>
<p>OMG takes all reasonable measures to ensure that profile information and user data are stored as securely as possible and not lost, misused or altered. </p>
<p>OMG’s infrastructure is hosted in an enterprise-level, highly secure data centre with UPS, fire detection and suppression systems with a sophisticated environment management system. Fortigate Firewalls at all our sites provide site to site VPN tunnels. Strong encryption &amp; DH group, short keylife and the latest VPN technologies (PFS,replay detection) ensure the highest level of security.</p>
<p>Access to profile information and user data is restricted to those members of staff who must use it in order to carry out their responsibilities. </p>
<p>When clients, affiliates or users have been provided with a password that is intended to protect access to their profile or account information, it is their responsibility to keep that password confidential. </p>
<p>Data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of information to third parties</h2>
<p>OMG will not pass data to any third party for any reason, subject to the following exceptions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>OMG may disclose personal profile information to any law enforcement agency who requests it in connection with the commission of an offence, or to comply with applicable laws and lawful government and/or regulatory requests.</li>
    <li>OMG may share profile information and/or user data with third-party suppliers engaged with us to assist in the provision of services to OMG clients. OMG suppliers are carefully managed to ensure that they comply with all the terms of this privacy policy when storing or processing the data covered by it. </li>
    <li>In the event of a corporate transaction such as the purchase or sale of a business or assets, OMG may disclose aggregate information on users or affiliates to the purchaser or seller involved. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both profile information and user data may be transferred between the subsidiary group companies of Online Media Group, or between subsidiary companies and the holding company, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985 or section 1519 of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable. </p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Advertisements served by OMG Network and displayed at affiliate sites may use cookies stored on users’ computers to record information on clicks, leads and sales – in other words, information on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>which advertisements users have seen or clicked on</li>
    <li>which websites they visit before and after viewing a particular advertisement </li>
    <li>whether or not they have made a purchase as a result of clicking on a particular advertisement. </li>
</ul>
<p>OMG cookies do not include any personally identifiable information and are used purely to track the performance of OMG affiliates, as well as to improve the relevancy (‘targeting’) of served advertisements, for example by making them more closely related to the type of website or web page that a particular user has visited. </p>
<p>Many web browsers allow users to decline specific cookies (or all cookies) if they wish, without damaging their experience. </p>
<p>Under the terms of their contracts with OMG, all OMG affiliates are obliged to inform their users of the fact that OMG advertisements hosted on their sites may store cookies to users’ computers, in addition to their statutory privacy and data protection responsibilities.  </p>
<p>OMG has no control over any additional cookies that may be used by its affiliates or clients. </p>
<h2>Subject access requests</h2>
<p>Under the Data Protection Act, individuals can ask to see the information about themselves that is held on computer and in some paper records.</p>
<p>If you want to exercise this right, please write to us at the address above, including sufficient information for us to confirm your identity (name, email and login details as a minimum). </p>
<h2>Consent</h2>
<p>By continuing to use the OMG website, you confirm your acceptance of the terms of this privacy policy.  </p>
<p>If you do not accept the terms of this privacy policy, you should not provide OMG with any profile information. However, please note that OMG may not be able to provide you with some or all of its services in the absence of this information. </p>
<h2>Revision</h2>
<p>We may revise this policy at any time in order to reflect changes to our services, or to comply with changes to relevant legislation and reserve the right to do so without notice. We advise you to check this page often in order to ensure you are aware of any recent revisions. </p>
<h2>Links to third-party websites</h2>
<p>The OMG website contains links to websites owned and operated by third parties. OMG is not responsible for the content of these websites. </p>
