# Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. As we are using the WordPress software platform to provide our services, we have adopted the same privacy principles used by Wordpress.com (these are the principles implemented in the software, and they are good ones).

Our privacy principles are:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. 
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services
  * In our website and blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.

OM4 (“OM4”) operates several websites including om4.com.au, om4business.com and om4tourism.com. It is OM4’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.  
Website Visitors

Like most website operators, OM4 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. OM4’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how OM4’s visitors use its website. From time to time, OM4 may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

OM4 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. OM4 does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to OM4’s websites choose to interact with OM4 in ways that require OM4 to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that OM4 gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an OM4 community website to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with OM4 are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, OM4 collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with OM4. OM4 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics

OM4 may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, OM4 may monitor the most popular blogs on the OM4 community websites. OM4 may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, OM4 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

OM4 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on OM4’s behalf or to provide services available at OM4’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using OM4’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. OM4 will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, OM4 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when OM4 believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of OM4, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an OM4 website and have supplied your email address, OM4 may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with OM4 and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. OM4 takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. OM4 uses cookies to help OM4 identify and track visitors, their usage of OM4 website, and their website access preferences. OM4 visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using OM4’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of OM4’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, OM4 may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in OM4’s sole discretion. OM4 encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have an OM4 community account, you should also check your site’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
