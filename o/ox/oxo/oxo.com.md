# OXO - Tools you hold on to.

We value the trust you place in OXO International, Ltd., a member of the Helen of Troy family of companies (referred to as "OXO" or "we" or "our"). We want to ensure that you understand what information we gather about you, how we use it, and the safeguards we have in place in order to protect it. If you have additional questions or would like further information on this topic, please feel free to contact us. OXO may update this policy from time to time. Please visit this page periodically to review the privacy policy. 

###### How does OXO ensure that your information is secure?

OXO will maintain practices and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of customer information. We restrict and limit access to customer information only to those of our employees or authorized service providers who need it to carry out their business functions, and educate our employees about safeguarding customer information and preventing its unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. When credit card information is transmitted online, OXO uses industry standard security measures called SSL (secure socket layer encryption). 

###### What type of information does OXO collect?

OXO gathers customer information needed to provide superior service, communicate offers on merchandise and services that we believe will be of interest to you, and to administer our business. In order to best serve you, we may gather information from you in a few instances. 

First, when you visit our site, we may collect non-personally identifiable information from you. Through the use of computer "cookies" (small pieces of information that are stored by the browser on your hard drive), we collect data, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, and specific OXO web pages through which you click. The cookies that are configured by us do not contain any personally identifying information, such as your name, or sensitive information, such as your credit card number. This data is collected automatically, and utilized in aggregate to help us look for trends so that we can improve our website and your OXO experience. The cookies also allow us to recognize you when you return to our site and to provide you with a customized experience that we feel will be of value to you. 

Most web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookie files on your computer by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file is stored. Please take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this function. If you do elect to disable the OXO cookie, please note that you may not be able to take full advantage of a personalized experience at OXO. 

Second, we may ask you to voluntarily provide information in a few circumstances. When you purchase items, we will ask you to voluntarily provide certain personally identifiable information, such as, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card number. We need this information to process and fulfill your order and notify you of order status. Other examples of when we may ask you to voluntarily provide personally identifiable information include if you subscribe to our email program (information such as your name and e-mail address), choose to provide us preference information (such as interests, product preferences, and items purchased), or when you enter a sweepstakes or promotion (information such as name, address and telephone number). 

Additionally, in order to provide you with goods and services designed to meet your needs, we may collect demographic information (such as number of household members, age, and gender), purchase preference information, and mailing lists from third parties. We use this information to customize your experience on our website and to provide you with the most relevant products and services. 

###### What information do we share and with whom?

OXO does not rent or sell customer information to outside marketers. In certain circumstances, OXO may share your customer information with trusted service providers that need access to your information to provide operational or other support services. To ensure the confidentiality and security of your information, service providers must agree to safeguard your information in strict compliance with our policy. We also may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it. In the event of a sale of all or part of one of our businesses, we may share customer information related to that business as part of the transaction. 

###### What is OXO's commitment to children's privacy?

Protecting the privacy of the young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

###### Can I "opt out" of receiving promotional e-mails from OXO?

OXO may send you e-mails with promotional offers. If you would no longer like to receive e-mailed special event information, sales notifications or other messages from OXO, you may contact us and your e-mail address will be removed from our marketing list. 

###### How can I access my OXO information obtained through this website?

You can access your OXO information obtained through this website by contacting us.
