## Your Privacy Rights

Individuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area (“EEA”), have certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Data. Below are the rights that you have under law, and what Syncro does to protect those rights:

  *  **The right to be informed.** Syncro is publishing this Privacy Policy to keep you informed as to what we do with your personal information. We strive to be transparent about how we use your data. 
  * **The right to access.** You may have the right to access the personal information that we hold about you. When you exercise your right to request access to the information Syncro processes about you, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 
  * **The right to rectification.** If the information Syncro holds about you is inaccurate or not complete, you may have the right to ask us to rectify it. If that data has been passed to a third party with your consent or for legal reasons, then we will ask them to rectify the data. 
  * **The right to erasure.** This is sometimes called ‘the right to be forgotten’. In certain circumstances, you may have the right to the erasure of personal information that we hold about you (for example if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected). Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions, or to comply with our legal obligations. 
  * **The right to restrict processing.** You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information in certain circumstances (for example, where you believe that the personal information we hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held). This means we are permitted to store the data but not further process it. We keep just enough data to make sure we respect your request in the future. 
  * **The right to portability.** You may have the right to be provided with your personal data in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format, and to request that we transfer the personal information provided by you to another service or provider. 
  * **The right to object.** You may have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for purposes based on our legitimate interests. In some cases, we may be able to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms. 
  * **The right to withdraw consent.** We may seek to rely on your consent in order to process certain personal information. Where we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent or to withdraw your consent at any time. You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Syncro by clicking "unsubscribe" in any marketing email communications we send you, or by sending an email to [privacy@oxygenxml.com](mailto:privacy@oxygenxml.com). Please note that if we can also rely on other bases to process your personal data aside from consent, then we may do so even if you have withdrawn your consent. 
  * **The right to comply to Supervisory Authority.** You have the right to complain to the Supervisory Authority if you feel that Syncro has not responded to your requests to solve a problem. 
  * **The right in relation to automated decision making and profiling.** If we use either automated decision making or profiling, then you have a right to know. Also, we need your consent if either of these are used to make a decision that affects you. As with all consent, you can withdraw it at any time. 



If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please contact [privacy@oxygenxml.com](mailto:privacy@oxygenxml.com) so that we may consider your request under applicable law (see Privacy Complaints section).

## How Long We Keep Information

We will retain Personal Data we collect from you where we have a justifiable business need to do so and/or for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, legal, accounting, or other purposes). After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below: 

  * If you are a customer, partner, or prospect, we keep the information for the duration of our relationship. Due to the possibility of long sales cycles, one never knows when a potential client will re-engage with Syncro and having the background and history of the contracting party will assist Syncro in providing a better service. Therefore, please note that unless you instruct us otherwise, we retain the information we collect for as long as needed to provide our Products and Services and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 
  * When you contact us for technical support, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues that you might be facing. Your information may be retained for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirement. 
  * If you have requested to receive marketing communications, we will keep your personal information only for as long as you interact with us, or until the data subject opts-out or asks to be forgotten. 



You can request deletion of your Personal Data at any time (see "Your Privacy Rights" section for further information) and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.

## Transfer of Personal Data

We may store data on remote servers operated by a cloud service provider to Syncro rather than storing it on our own servers. Regardless of where you use our online services or provide information to us, the information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside the country in which the data was collected (or, in the case of personal data collected within the European Economic Area (“EEA”), to countries outside the EEA). By providing any data through the online services, you hereby expressly consent to such transferring and processing of your data in such third countries.

## Use By Minors

The Sites, the Products, and the Services are not intended for use by minors. Syncro does not knowingly collect any personal data from persons under the age of 18 and will immediately delete any such data subsequently so determined. If you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected a minor’s personal information, please contact us at [privacy@oxygenxml.com](mailto:privacy@oxygenxml.com).

## Links to Third Party Websites

Syncro websites may contain links to other websites, which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may collect information about you that will be used in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose any personal information to others.

## Data Security

We use reasonable measures to safeguard personally identifiable information, which measures are appropriate to the type of information maintained, and follows applicable laws regarding the safeguarding of any such information under our control.

Syncro trains all staff who handle Personal Data on the importance of and procedure for maintaining confidentiality. All employees, contractors, consultants, and service providers of Syncro who are provided access to such information on behalf of Syncro are required to be familiar with and comply with the provisions of this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We do not warrant or represent that personal information about you will be protected against loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.
