###  Data Retention policy

We securely store your information, and hold it for as long as we need to in order provide our services and products to you in accordance with (i) law, or (ii) or any relevant contract you have with us.

We also use customer purchase data for research purposes as part of our measures for improving our product and service offering.

We review our retention periods for personal information regularly. If in our audits, we find that your data no longer satisfies the conditions mentioned above, we remove them from our active database.  

###  Transferring of personal data overseas

Your personal information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA“) and may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, or for one of our service providers.

When we, or our permitted third parties, transfer your information outside the European Economic Area, we or they will impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your information to the standard required in the European Economic Area. 

Some examples of when we share your information are below:

  * When you make a payment on our site, your payment will be processed by a specialist payment processor to ensure a secure transaction.
  * When we need to use delivery services to send you physical products you ordered.
  * When we send you an email or a push notification, these are delivered by marketing platforms. As part of this service, certain information such as message opens, clicks and formatting are recorded to help deliver the best email experience.

If you request for us to no longer contact you via marketing communications, we will retain the minimum amount of information about you to ensure we remove you from any future communications. Please note that if you ask us to completely remove your details in our database, and you subsequently use our products and services at a later date, we won’t be able to recognise your earlier request to not be contacted, which is why we keep the minimum allowable data in order to isolate them from our send lists.
