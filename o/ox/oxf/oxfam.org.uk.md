### 1\. What personally identifiable information does Oxfam GB collect from me?

Like many websites, Oxfam GB uses cookies in order to provide you with a more personalised web service.

A cookie is a text-only string of information that we pass to your computer’s hard disk through your web-browser so that the website can remember who you are. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. 

A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. 

For more information about cookies, please see [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

We use two types of cookies on our website:

  * **per session cookies** , which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookies file of your browser until you leave the site; and **persistent cookies** , which remain in the cookies file of your browser for longer (although how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie) . These cookies are used to store state information between visits to a site. 



We use **persistent cookies** to provide certain services, so that you do not have to log-in repeatedly between visits. 

Atlas, an independent internet marketing and research company, gathers non-personal information regarding the visitors to our website on our behalf using cookies embedded on our website and on our adverts on third party websites. Oxfam may also monitor which websites you have come from prior to entering the Oxfam site and which websites you move on to after leaving the Oxfam site. Oxfam uses this information in order to assess the impact of, and develop adverts and campaigns.

If you do not wish to receive cookies you can easily modify your web browser to refuse cookies, or to notify you when you receive a new cookie. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled, and so in order to enjoy the Oxfam site to the full, we recommend that you leave them switched on.

### 2\. How does Oxfam GB use my information?

Oxfam GB uses the information we collect about you to help us with understanding more about how our site is used and to be able to send you communications that may be of interest to you, either electronically or otherwise.

### 3\. Who is collecting your information?

When you are on the Oxfam GB website and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Oxfam GB alone unless stated otherwise. For example, when you are using our secure online donation pages you are going through to a partner company, World Pay plc. and it is clear on the donation page when you are going through to the World Pay site.

### 4\. With whom does Oxfam GB share your information?

As a general rule, Oxfam GB will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. When you are using our secure online donation pages you are going through to a partner company and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information is provided so that the transaction can take place.

### 5\. What are my choices regarding, collection, use and distribution of my information?

If you indicated that you are interested in receiving regular information about Oxfam’s campaign work or emergencies appeals we will send you communications regarding Oxfam’s work and activities, either electronically or otherwise. In addition, we may send you direct mail that we feel may be of interest to you.

Oxfam GB does not sell, rent or share user information with anyone. We may on occasion work with 3rd parties to contact our supporters about Oxfam, however the 3rd party would be bound by a confidentiality agreement which would prevent them from using this information for any other purpose.

### 6\. What is Oxfam GB’s policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?

The accuracy of your individual identifying information is important to Oxfam GB. We are working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information that Oxfam maintains about you.

### 7\. How does Oxfam GB protect my personal identifiable information?

Oxfam GB is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual identifying information that you provide to us.

### 8\. What about children’s privacy?

The safety of children is very important to us. Our education site Cool Planet does not collect personal information from children. We do have a graffiti board on the site but this is moderated and does not display the full name of individual children nor their addresses. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online.

### 9\. What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?

When you give Oxfam GB personal information that information may be stored and processed outside of the UK and we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Oxfam GB cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
