# How we use your personal details | Oxfam GB

At Oxfam, we rely on the generosity and support of private individuals like you to carry out our vital work to tackle poverty. That is why we want to be completely transparent about why we need the personal details we request when you support us and how we will use them.

[Oxfam's full Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy-and-security/full-privacy-policy)

### When we will get in touch

When you give us your personal details - for example, when you make a donation, sign a petition, volunteer or campaign with us, sign up to receive email updates, support our "Tag Your Bag" scheme, or register for an event - you may receive follow up information from us directly relevant to this activity, including how your support is helping.

If you have provided us with consent to use your details for marketing purposes, then we may also contact you about our projects, fundraising activities and appeals, and other ways to support us. Where you consent to us sending you marketing information, we will treat this as lasting for 2 years unless we tell you otherwise at the time. We may also send you occasional marketing letters where we think these are likely to be of interest, and where you purchase items from the Oxfam on-line shop we may send you emails about other relevant offers. We provide easy ways to stop our marketing, and you can opt out at any time.

You, our supporters, really are the life-blood of Oxfam. We always act on your instructions and we aim to put you in control of your relationship with us. Our aim is to communicate with you in a way that makes you want to stay involved with us for as long as possible, as you see the value and impact of your support.

### We will not share your data for others' marketing purposes

Please be assured that you will not receive offers from other companies or organisations as a result of giving your details to us.

We may need to share limited information with our service providers who help us to prepare and send you our communications or process your donations and other responses. However, we do not allow these organisations to use your data for their own purposes and take care to ensure that they keep your data secure, and delete it when it is no longer needed.

### How to stop or change how we communicate with you

If at any time you wish to stop or change how we communicate with you, or update the information we hold, please do get in touch, using one of the following options:

  * Visit:  <https://www.oxfam.org.uk/your-contact-preferences>
  * Write to: Freepost Oxfam GB.  
[](mailto:changes@oxfam.org.uk)
  * Email: [changes@oxfam.org.uk](mailto:changes@oxfam.org.uk)
  * Call: 0300 200 1300 (Mon-Fri 0900-1700).



You can opt out of SMS communications by texting NOINFO to 70066. (This is charged at your standard text rate)

You can opt out of our emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our messages..

### What details we ask for and why

There are minimum levels of information we need to obtain for different purposes - such as donating money or signing up to Gift Aid. We always ask for your name and title so we know how to talk to you. We may need to confirm transactions you make on the Oxfam GB website by sending you an email, which is why this field is sometimes mandatory. We will separately seek your permission to use this for our wider marketing communications.

We may ask for your house number and postcode so that we hold a valid postal address for you. We might need this information for the following reasons:

  * To set up Direct Debits and one-off card payments
  * To claim Gift Aid
  * To deliver items to you (items you have purchased or event materials for example)
  * If you have agreed to receive post from us, or we believe you may wish to hear from us in this way, we will also use your postcode and address to send you relevant information.



In order to ensure that the data we hold about you is accurate and up to date, we may occasionally use information sources that are in the public domain to verify your details, such as your postal address.

### Your data and social media

We may use your email address and phone number to match to your account on Facebook or other social media sites in order to show you Oxfam content while you are using these services. We will only do this where you have opted in to our marketing emails or phone calls, and your personal data is kept secure at all times. We may also use your email address and phone number to link to Facebook or other social media sites in order to identify other users of these sites whom we believe would be interested in Oxfam, and we may then show them Oxfam content.

Information on how to stop this use of your data is given in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/privacy-and-security/full-privacy-policy).
