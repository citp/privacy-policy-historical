The safety of children is very important to us. Our education site Cool Planet does not collect personally identifiable from children.

Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online.

When you give Oxfam GB personal information that information may be stored and processed outside of the UK and we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Oxfam GB cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
