Original statement is <https://osdn.net/docs-ja/Privacy_Policy> (Japanese). 

This document describes our policies of the following OSDN Sites (individually "Site" and collectively "Sites") on the collection, use, and disclosure of users' personal information, and describes the choices available to users regarding how to update and correct their personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to OSDN Corporation (hereafter referred to as OSDN) and its subsidiaries and affiliates. 

[OSDN.net](http://osdn.net/)  
[SRAD.jp](http://srad.jp/)  
[osdn.co.jp](http://osdn.co.jp/)

We are committed to good privacy practices regarding personal data, and we aim to give the users of our Sites as much rights as possible to control their own personal information including registration information. Under strict control, we safely accumulate and store personal information that we collect or submitted to us, and take appropriate preventive and corrective actions against improper access to, loss, destruction, falsification, and leaking of personal information. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all activities or behaviors of our users during the registering and using of the Sites owned by OSDN. Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use Agreement](https://osdn.net/tos.php), we do not release personal data about our users and visitors without their permission. By proceeding to use the OSDN Services, you consent that we may process the personal data that we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

## 1\. The information we gather

We gather the following types of personal information. 

**Information given to us by users:**  
In certain areas of the Sites, we may request a user to provide us with certain personal information. For example, it applies to information such as username, social media services, email address, and self introduction provided in order to complete the profile on the registered account. However, for most of the information, beside username, it is left to the user's discretion to register. 

We may request the users to provide us with personal information when they post contents (such as source code, release files, articles, journal, photos, comments, or reviews), create a new account, subscribe to any of our mailing lists, or participate in certain services. That could include personal information such as phone number, name, zip code, age, or profession. 

**Information we collect about users:**  
When a user uses the Sites, we may automatically collect technical information about the user’s visit including pages the user visited, the order in which they were visited, page interaction information, the type of device the user is using, IP address, operating system, header information and browser software. 

**Information we receive from other sources:**  
We may receive information about our users from various business partners including advertising networks. We may work with third parties to collect information that allows us to associate our users with their accounts they have on social media or other websites. 

**Aggregated data:**  
We may aggregate the data we collect from our users (including IP addresses, operating system, and browser software types). In the course of aggregating the data, we anonymize and de-identify it so each piece of data cannot be associated with the user. We may disclose Aggregated Data to advertisers to inform them the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements. 

## 2\. How we use the information we gather

**How we use Aggregated Data:**  
We use Aggregated Data to build higher quality, more useful sites by performing statistical analysis of collective characteristics and behaviors of our users, and by measuring demographics and interests.

## 4\. Cookies, web beacons and similar tracking Technologies

On OSDN Sites, there are pages that use technology called "web beacons". It is a technology also known as clear GIF, in which small graphic files are used to track the accesses to certain pages. With this technology, it is possible to track a specific individual, but on our Sites, we do not use it for such purpose to obtain personal data, except that we may use it as a part of the mechanism to make sure that the downloading of contents occurs at a server that is geographically close to the user. 

Certain browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that allows you to tell websites or applications that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Please note that at this time our Sites generally do not respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals. 

We also use cookies on our Sites to provide our users with information that meets their needs. Cookie is a data file that is sent to the browser from a site that a user visited, which could be stored in the user's environment by the browser. It is user's responsibility to turn off cookies or delete existing cookies from the user’s environment. Please note that by opting out of cookies, you may encounter a situation where a part of or the entire OSDN Site may not function properly. 

**Interest-Based Advertising:**  
We may also participate in advertising networks that use interest-based advertising methods relying on cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies. This means that a user may see advertising on our Sites tailored to the user’s browsing behavior, or the user may see our advertising on other websites based on their behavior on our Sites. 

Some internet browsers, websites, and mobile devices offer opt-outs for interest-based advertising. For additional information, please refer to the website that you are visiting, your browser and/or your device settings, and our "[Policy and Procedures Regarding Advertisement Agents](https://osdn.net/docs/advertise_vender)". From the document, you can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads individually from external service providers.

**Access Analysis:**  
On our Sites, in order to conduct a research on the users’ trends or to deliver the most relevant advertising, we acquire statistical information regarding Site usage by using third party access analysis service. Like the aforementioned interest-based advertising, this access analysis service uses technologies such as cookies. With this access analysis tool, data obtained by advertising network may be statistically processed in conjunction with the user attribute data obtained by advertising networks, and this information does not identify any specific individual and will be treated in a form of anonymous data. It will not be used for any other purposes. 

**Third party website links & subdomains:**  
On OSDN Sites, links to third party websites are provided solely as a convenience to the user. When a user uses these links, the user leaves the Sites. Please note that our Privacy Policy do not apply to these third party websites. We do not review and control these third party sites, and are not responsible for any of the third party sites, their content, or their privacy practices. We do not endorse or make any representations about the third party websites and products.

## 5\. Security

On our Sites, we encrypt most of the transmission of information, including when users enter personal information on our web forms. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us. 

However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. It is users' responsibility to protect the security of their login information, and we advise that users do not make any confidential information publicly available through our Sites. 

## 6\. Polls & Sweepstakes 

Occasionally, we may conduct sweepstakes, contests, and polls on our Sites in order to better deliver advertisements and contents and to better understand the users' needs. 

Participation in these sweepstakes or contests is completely voluntary, and a user who decides to participate may be requested to submit information which typically includes contact information. Any personal data that users submit in connection with these activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, for certain sweepstakes, we may individually provide additional terms. We may use a third party service providers to conduct these polls or contests. These third party service providers will be prohibited from using our users’ personal data for any other purposes. 

OSDN Sites include widgets provided by generally well-known social media, such as the Facebook "Like" button. Using sign-in services of these social media networks, you may be able to login to OSDN Sites or post contents on social media sites either manually or automatically. Please note that your interactions with these features are subject to privacy policy of the company providing it, and not by this Privacy Policy.

## 10\. Special types of personal data:

We do not intentionally collect any personal data that is considered "special" or "sensitive" under the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, biometric, or health data, or data concerning anything to do with a person's sexuality. 

## 11\. Applicable law

Because OSDN and most of the servers for our Sites are located in Japan, our Privacy Policy has been prepared to comply with applicable Japanese law. Users located in the European Economic Area may have additional rights arising under GDPR. 

## 12\. Data transfers to third countries

We provide our Sites and related services from Japan. We may outsource the handling of your personal information to a third party service provider located outside of the user’s residential country, and we may share the information. Since it is not possible for users to use our Sites and services without these data transfers, we require their consent to the transfer of their personal data to Japan or countries where the third party service providers are located. 

In these cases, the user’s personal information will be subject to personal information protection law that may be different from the law of the user's residential country, and in those areas the user may have less legal rights in relation to the user’s personal information. We treat users' personal data in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Policy expressed in this document. 

## 13\. Changes that Could Be Added to this Privacy Policy

We may update a part of or the entire Privacy Policy expressed in this document in the future. If we make any material changes we will notify our users by means of a prominent notice on our Sites.
