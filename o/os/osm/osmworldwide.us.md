# Privacy Policy | OSM Worldwide | Your High Value Mail and Shipping Solution

**Our Commitment to Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

**What We Gather:**   
For each visitor to our page, our server automatically recognizes the domain name and the page where the consumer last visited (where possible). This information is used to help us identify sources of web traffic to our site. We gather only the domain name and not the e-mail address of visitors to our page. 

We also collect information such as the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and sign up for our newsletters. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our page, and to notify consumers about updates to our site, new products or services, but is not shared with other non-affiliated organizations for commercial purposes. If you do not want to receive e-mails from us, you may remove yourself from our mailing list. When you receive a newsletter, there will be a link at the bottom where you will be able to remove yourself if you no longer wish to receive the correspondence. 

**Cookies:**   
We use "cookies" to record session information. This information is not to gather any marketing information. 

HTTP cookies, sometimes known as web cookies or just cookies, are parcels of text sent by a server to a web browser and then sent back unchanged by the browser each time it accesses that server. HTTP cookies are used for authenticating, tracking, and maintaining specific information about users, such as site preferences and the contents of their electronic shopping carts. 

**Our Commitment to Data Security:  
**To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**How to Contact Us:**  
Again, we take your privacy very seriously. If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at 866-681-7867. Additionally, we invite you to e-mail any concerns to [info@osmworldwide.com](mailto:info@osmworldwide.com).
