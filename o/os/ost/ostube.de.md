9.4. We use Google Analytics to display advertisements placed by Google and its partners within advertising services only to users who have also shown an interest in our online offer or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products that are determined by the web pages visited) that we transmit to Google (so-called "remarketing" or "Google Analytics Audiences"). With the help of remarketing audiences, we would also like to ensure that our ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and are not annoying.

9.5. We use Google Analytics only with IP anonymization enabled. This means that Google will truncate the IP address of users within member states of the European Union or in other signatories of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
