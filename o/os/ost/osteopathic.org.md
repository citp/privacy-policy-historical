Aggregate information is information in summary form and is not considered PII because it does not reveal your identity.

The AOA uses and allows third parties to use aggregate information to aid in the development or implementation of programs, products and services. The AOA also uses such aggregate information to analyze website visits, page views and referral links to gain insight into functionality, interest, and overall user experience.

Financial information

The AOA does not disclose payment information provided by its members and customers. When members and customers choose to pay, whether by credit card, check, or other form of payment, AOA submits the information needed to obtain payment to the appropriate clearinghouse.

Activity tracking

AOA websites use cookies to improve users’ experience with our Sites. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive which allows organizations to collect non-PII about the user’s use of a site. This cookie is used to identify you, to assist in displaying personalized content on our Sites or to save your Site login information. Some of the ways we use cookies are to identify you, assist in displaying personalized content, save your login information and analyze our traffic.​

Some of our websites and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit the AOA, for example, to count users who have visited those pages, or opened an email, and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

The AOA may use automatic data collection technology to gather information about your device(s) and how you interact with content on our sites. This may include information such as whether you are a new or existing user, the duration and frequency of your visits, the web content you view, and what searches you conduct. We may also collect information about how you’re accessing our sites, such as the type of device you’re using (e.g., cellphone, tablet, desktop computer, etc.), what browser you’re using, your network, your operating system and the speed of your server connection.

Managing your PII

You can manage your profile and email preferences, or request to be removed from any non-transactional communication from the AOA by contacting us using the information in the [ **Contac** **t** **Us**](https://osteopathic.org/about/contact-us/) section of Osteopathic.org. California residents have additional considerations per California’s “Shine the Light” law.

You have the right to:

  * opt out of some or all future communications from us;


  * Request and view any personal data we have about you;

  * correct or update any data we have about you*;

  * ask us to stop using or sharing data about you; and/or

  * ask us to delete any data we have about you.




The AOA will remove your PII from our active databases or anonymize so that the data is no longer identified with you. In instances where physicians request the AOA’s assistance in verifying credentials for employment, licensing or other practice-related support, deletion of your data could impede or delay the credentialing process. Additionally, your data may remain in our archives if the AOA determines that it is not possible to delete.

*Corrections or updates to certain data we have on you (i.e., licensure, medical education or training, etc.) will require primary source verification prior to any changes to your data.

Physician data collection & use

The AOA collects data on all osteopathic medical students and osteopathic physicians, including those who are not AOA members, which is collectively referred to as the AOA Masterfile (“Masterfile”). Osteopathic physicians are physicians who have graduated from medical schools accredited by the AOA’s Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation. The AOA also collects data on those who are not DOs but who are members of the AOA, such as allied or associate members.

The AOA obtains osteopathic medical school, internship/residency and fellowship training, and board certification information only from primary sources. It obtains demographic information from osteopathic medical schools. The AOA also obtains address and contact information from commercial sources and from other organizations related to the osteopathic medical profession, including osteopathic state associations and specialty colleges.

The Masterfile is used in aggregate form to document and research trends in the osteopathic medical profession and the important role osteopathic physicians serve in health care. It benefits the practicing physician by providing an easy way for the public, hospitals and licensing boards to verify credentials.

Each physician record in the Masterfile includes demographic information, osteopathic medical school, postgraduate information, and current practice information. Demographic information includes gender, date of birth, self-identified race/ethnicity, mailing address and other contact information. Current practice information includes type of practice, self-identified specialty, state medical licensure, National Provider Identifier (NPI) number, opioid prescriber number, and board certification from AOA or ABMS certifying boards. Physicians may also ask the AOA to verify certain types of non-osteopathic postgraduate medical education, which then becomes part of their physician record.

While data verification and authentication are the Masterfile’s primary purpose, the AOA shares limited information from the Masterfile with other osteopathic organizations, and licenses portions of its Masterfile to selected licensees. Both operate under carefully restricted information usage agreements. The AOA does not release home addresses to licensees when we have a business address. Licensees work with many health care related companies that offer a wide range of products and services that may be of interests for osteopathic physicians and the larger medical community. They include:

  * Medical and professional journals


  * Drug recall and safety information

  * Continuing medical education programs

  * Physician credential verification services

  * Drug samples and pharmaceutical information

  * Medical equipment and supplies

  * Employment opportunities

  * General practice-related commercial offers of interest to physicians as consumers




In addition to the PII management rights listed earlier, physicians may further direct the AOA:

  * To exclude them from the AOA’s online patient referral service, Find Your DO, on [DoctorsThatDO.org](https://www.doctorsthatdo.org/).


  * Not to release contact information to affiliates or licensees: This option permits the AOA to contact the physician, but the AOA will not share any contact information with other osteopathic organizations, or with its licensees, which is the basis for receiving most of their products and services, including journals, new product announcements, information about health hazards and information about drug recalls.

  * Not to release physician-provided information (PII): This option means that the AOA will not release any physician-provided information to licensees or other osteopathic organizations. This would include not-releasing physician-provided information used to announce drug recalls and health hazards, information given to state licensing agencies and agencies verifying credentials such as hospitals and physician groups. Physicians electing this non-release option will also be excluded from the AOA’s Find Your DO searches, and will not receive the JAOA or any AOA special publications.




The AOA will immediately record your request and preferences; however, there will be a delay while your request to remove PII is communicated to its licensees. You may see residual marketing and communication pieces or emails for a short length of time until your PII is removed. Please [**contact the AOA**](https://osteopathic.org/about/contact-us/) should you have any questions or concerns.

### Information security

The AOA takes precautions to protect the information we collect. We use SSL encryption to protect your payment transactions. We also take necessary precautions to protect our database off-line. The server on which we store personally identifiable information is kept in a secure environment.

Due to the current state of technology, there is no ability to provide complete assurance as to the security of data transmissions over the Internet and electronically stored data.  While the AOA takes appropriate and reasonable efforts to protect the PII and other Data from unauthorized access as described in this Privacy Policy, we are unable to guarantee or warrant the security of the Personal Data you transmit to us.
