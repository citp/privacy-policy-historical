# Privacy Policy | Owens Corning

## Owens Corning's Internet Privacy Statement

Owens Corning respects the privacy of every individual who visits our web site, sends us e-mail or responds to our interactive advertisements. This Privacy Statement states how Owens Corning will collect, use and disclose information it collects from you. This Privacy Statement may be changed at any time, and Owens Corning will notify you of any such changes by posting an updated version of the Privacy Statement on this page of the web site.

## Personally-Identifiable Information

There are several opportunities on our web site for you to provide us with personally-identifiable information about you (such as name, mailing address and e-mail address) and your interests. If you choose to share any personal information with us, we may store it and use it to provide you with an individualized user experience and for marketing research and other marketing purposes. This may include sharing it with other companies in the Owens Corning family, our third-party business partners, and/or our third-party business consultants and providers (collectively, "Providers") so that they may contact you for direct marketing purposes, including offers of discounts on services.

## Non-Personal Information

Sometimes, we may collect non-personal information about you that is anonymous data. The information we receive is for Owens Corning's use only and is not disclosed to any other party except in aggregate form. Examples of this information include the length and time of your visit, the pages you looked at on our site, the type of Internet Browser you have and the site you visited just before coming to ours. We use this information to develop ideas for improving our site and to measure site activity. This may include sharing it with our Providers.

## Cookies

Our web site makes use of "cookie" files to customize information to your personal tastes. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your Browser, which may store some information on your computer. Then, when you come back to our site or visit other websites, information can be tailored to suit your individual preferences. The goal is to save you time and provide you with a more meaningful online experience. Most Internet Browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions to learn more about these functions.

## Third Parties

Owens Corning may establish relationships with reputable business partners that allow visitors to our site to navigate directly to sites operated by these partners. We choose our business partners carefully. However, Owens Corning is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third party web sites that may be linked to on this site. These links are meant for the user's convenience only and do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Owens Corning of the content, policies, or practices of such sites nor any products or services which may be offered through that site. Once you have left the Owens Corning site via such a link, you should check the applicable Privacy Statement of the third party site.

We are currently using certain third party tools on our website and may, in the future, implement additional analytics tools. Data collected as a result of our use of such tools, however, is only used internally to enhance our users’ experience using our website and for our own internal business purposes. Such data may be shared with our partners and advertisers, if at all, only as aggregate information and as otherwise specified in this privacy policy. Please contact us if you have any specific questions regarding our use of analytics or other analytics tools.

Currently, (i) other parties (e.g. third-party advertising networks and analytics providers) may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our website or services, and (ii) we do not respond to, or take any specific action in connection with the receipt of, Do-Not-Track signals or other similar mechanisms regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

Under California Civil Code, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and want a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address:

## Security

Your personally identifiable information is one of our valuable assets. It is kept in a secure datacenter and is accessible only to authorized personnel as needed to perform operations governed by this Privacy Statement.
