# Privacy

Given OWASP’s mission to help organizations with application security, you have the right to expect protection of any personal information that we might collect about our members.

In general, we do not require authentication or ask visitors to reveal personal information when visiting our website. We collect Internet addresses, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors solely for use in calculating various website statistics. 

We may ask for certain personal information, including name and email address from persons downloading OWASP products. This information is not divulged to any third party and is used only for the purposes of: 

  * Communicating urgent fixes in the OWASP Materials
  * Seeking advice and feedback about OWASP Materials
  * Inviting participation in OWASP’s consensus process and AppSec conferences



OWASP publishes a list of member organizations and individual members. Listing is purely voluntary and “opt-in”. Listed members can request not to be listed at any time.

All information about you or your organization that you send us by fax or mail is physically protected. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact us at [owasp@owasp.org](mailto:owasp@owasp.org)
