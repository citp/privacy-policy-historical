<p>Your privacy is OwnerIQ's top priority. At OwnerIQ we collect information about the products and services that people own, use or have shown interest in, and use that information to help our advertising and publishing partners provide relevant advertising and content to those people as they surf the internet. You will see that explained further as you view this the <a href="http://www.owneriq.com">www.owneriq.com</a> site (the "Site").</p> 

		<p>The below information about our privacy policy relates to your activities on the Site, and what information we gather on the Site and what we do with it. We do this to ensure that you are informed as to how we handle this anonymous information on behalf of our publisher, advertising network and advertising partners.</p>

		<h6>How we Collect Anonymous Information</h6>
		<p>OwnerIQ collects anonymous information on users of the Site. The technologies utilized allow OwnerIQ to collect this information entirely anonymously and we will never be able to identify you individually based on this information that is collected.</p>

		<h6>Anonymous Data Collection Technologies:</h6>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> OwnerIQ, like almost all websites, uses a simple technology feature of your browser to place a cookie on your hard drive. Cookies are used by web sites to recognize a computer they have encountered before. Cookies do not include any information which is personal to you or would allow anyone to identify you individually. The cookie simply tells us that we have encountered your computer in the past when you have visited the Site. Most of the web sites you visit use cookies to enhance the users experience on those sites.</li>

			<li><strong>Clear GIFs &amp; Servers:</strong> We also use electronic images known as "transparent GIFs", "Web bugs", "pixel tags" or "web beacons" — that allow OwnerIQ, including third party ad networks and exchanges to track general user traffic patterns. OwnerIQ also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested.</li>
		</ul>
		  
		<h6>What Information Is Collected?</h6>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
		Through use of the date collection methods, OwnerIQ collects anonymous data while you are visiting its web site or a Partner Website, including advertisers, advertising exchanges and Web publishers. This anonymous data includes information such as a users IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to identify your computer), web pages which have been viewed by the user, date and time, and responses by a user to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. Our advertising platform partners, as well as OwnerIQ use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons as described above.
		<br><br>
		When you have provided Personally Identifiable Information as part of a business inquiry or in your capacity as a customer, OwnerIQ may supplement information you provide with publicly available information about a users demographics. For example, if a customer or prospective customer indicates she lives in X zip code, we may obtain information giving representative geographic information about X zip code. This information is called "Supplementary Information". You may elect not to allow us to use this anonymous data by following the OwnerIQ <a href="opt-out.php">Opt-Out</a> process.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
OwnerIQ does not ask for or receive any PII as a result of its use of the anonymous data collection technologies used to gather information about product preferences as described above. This process is always anonymous.</li>
	</ul>

		<h6>Other Information That is Collected:</h6>

		<p>On the OwnerIQ website (<a href="http://www.owneriq.com">www.owneriq.com</a>) we may collect PII on individuals or companies who are inquiring about doing business with OwnerIQ in some capacity. We do maintain this information for the purpose of assessing working relationships with the individuals or companies who have submitted information. For example, if an individual submitted their email address and asked for information regarding an OwnerIQ product, we will maintain that information for purposes of assessing the opportunity and potentially contacting that individual and/or company with a response to the inquiry.</p>
		
		<p>We may also collect PII in the course of people submitting their information for employment consideration. This information will be maintained for this purpose, and for future consideration of employment.</p>
		
		<p>None of the PII that may be collected will be used for any other purpose excepting as may be required by law.</p>
		 
	  <h6>What We Do With Non-Personally Identifiable (Anonymous) Information</h6>
		
        <p>OwnerIQ operates an advertising platform and participates in advertising exchanges. After visiting the Site, we use the anonymous information collected to improve your experience on the Site, customizing content you may see on the Site and to retain any modifications you have made to your experience on the Site.  We may also use the anonymous information gathered through cookies and "web beacons" to enable advertising and content matching, both on the Site and on third party sites, using advertising exchanges and networks to provide relevant information regarding the services you have reviewed on our Site.</p>
        
<p>OwnerIQ will use non-PII in a number of ways. It will be used to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Keep count of return visits to our site or our Partners' sites</li>
			<li>Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on the Site</li>
			<li>Displaying the most appropriate advertising or content based on your interests demonstrated on the Site</li>
			<li>OwnerIQ partners with third party ad networks and exchanges to display its customers' ads throughout these third party networks. These third party ad networks and exchanges may use information regarding its own users to select which ads to display. We allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on our sites and, sometimes, in our newsletters to use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit the Web site of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are. Our advertisers', publisher's and Partner Site's use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.</li>
		</ul>

			<h6>Third-Party Disclosure of Non-PII?</h6>

			<p>Disclosure of Anonymous, Aggregated Information</p>
			
			<p>We may aggregate user information derived from the Site and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes.</p>

			<h6>Third-Party Disclosure of PII</h6>

			<p>OwnerIQ does not disclose PII to any third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, OwnerIQ may at any time disclose PII regarding a particular individual and any other information collected to third parties if we are required to do so by law, warrant, subpoena, regulation or court order.</p>
			
			<h6>Security</h6>
			
			<p>OwnerIQ has implemented reasonable security measures to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our security systems include authenticated access to internal databases, audits of procedures, and regular reviews of overall Web security.</p>

			<h6>Enforcement</h6>
