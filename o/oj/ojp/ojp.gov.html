               <p>If you access information on   our websites, the following basic information is automatically collected   and stored on Department of Justice servers:</p>
               <p>- The name of the internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you are connecting from a university's domain);<br>
                 - The Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you are using the Internet) from which you access our site;<br>
                 - The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;<br>
                 - The date and time you access our site;<br>
                 - The internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site; and<br>
                 - The pages you visit and the information you request.</p>
               <p>The Department of Justice does not use this information to track the browsing of individuals who access the site.  This information is primarily collected for statistical analysis and technical improvements to the site. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which may be used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. In certain circumstances, however, we may take additional steps to identify you based on this information and we may share this information, including your identity, with other government agencies.</p>

               <p>You   do not have to provide any personal information to us to access   information on our websites. If you choose to provide us with personal   information, such as by sending a  message to an e-mail address on this website or by filling out a form   and submitting it through our website, we will use that information to   respond to your message or to fulfill the stated purpose of the   communication. If you submit your resume to us electronically,  we will use your personal information to consider your application for   employment. The Department of Justice does not collect or use   information for commercial marketing.</p>
               <p>We   may share information you give us with contractors acting on our behalf   or with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that   agency. In  some circumstances, we may be required by law to disclose information you  submit or we may share this information with other agencies for law enforcement  purposes or to protect the Department's websites from security threats.&nbsp; If you   provide comments in response to a request for public comments, we may   make those comments as well as your identity available  to the public in a publication or by posting them on our website. Where   possible we may give you more specific guidance at the point of   collection regarding how your personal information may be used or   disclosed.</p>
               <p>Electronically   submitted information is maintained and destroyed according to the   principles of the Federal Records Act and the regulations and records   schedules of the National  Archives and Records Administration, and in some cases may be covered by   the Privacy Act and subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). A   discussion of the FOIA can be found at <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_guide09.htm">http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_guide09.htm</a>&nbsp;  and a discussion about the Privacy Act can be found at <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacyact1974.htm">http://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacyact1974.htm</a>.  &nbsp; </p>

               <p>Website measurement and customization technologies (commonly called “cookies") are small bits of text that are downloaded to your internet browser when you visit a website.  The Office of Management and Budget Memorandum <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov//sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf">M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies</a> defines conditions under which Federal agencies may use session and persistent cookies, and categorizes them in “tiers” to identify their characteristics. You may control permissions for cookies on this or any other website by adjusting your individual browser settings for customized privacy protection – see <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml">http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml</a> for helpful guidance.  You can still use Department websites if you do not accept the cookies, but you may be unable to use certain cookie-dependent features. </p>
               <p><em>Session cookies<br>
               </em>Session cookies are not stored on your computer’s hard drive, and are removed when you complete your session or exit the site. Some Department websites use these “Tier 1” session cookies to provide streamlined navigation and statistical analysis.  No personally identifying information is gathered.                 </p>
               <p><em>Persistent cookies 
                   <br>
               </em>Certain Department websites use “Tier 2” persistent cookies that remain on your computer’s hard drive after you complete an activity.  For example, some Department websites use persistent cookies in association with a voluntary customer satisfaction survey conducted by a third party, <a href="javascript:exitWinOpen('http://www.foreseeresults.com/privacy-policy.shtml')">Foresee Results</a><cite>TM</cite>.  These surveys obtain feedback and data regarding visitors’ satisfaction with our websites, but they do not collect any personally identifying information.  If you are randomly selected to participate in this survey, a persistent cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive for 90 days to preclude a new invitation during that time.  Some Department websites also use persistent cookies to enable a <a href="javascript:exitWinOpen('http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html')">Google Analytics</a> or 
               <a href="javascript:exitWinOpen('http://webtrends.com/privacy-policy/')">Webtrends</a> program to measure how new and returning visitors use our websites over time.  These persistent cookies do not collect any personally identifying information, and the information that is collected is only used to improve our websites. </p>

                <p>The   Department of Justice is pleased to participate in open, un-moderated   forums offered by third-party websites in order to increase government   transparency, promote public  participation and encourage collaboration with the Department.
