# OJR.org Privacy Policy

Online Journalism Review has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering practices.

## Registration

Online Journalism Review invites readers to register with the site. Registration is required for readers who wish to submit comments to articles and blog entries on the site. When registering, readers will be asked to provide their name, place of residence, date of birth and e-mail address, along with other identifying information. A reader's name, city of residence and voluntary biography may be published on the site, linked to from any comments he or she submits to the site. OJR does not publish registrants' e-mail addresses, but will forward messages to registrants that other readers submit for them via feedback forms.

Registration data, as well as any comments submitted to the site, become the property of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. USC does not sell or rent this registration data to any other source.

## Log files

We maintain and periodically review log files that automatically record the following information: the IP adddress (not the e-mail address) from which you are connecting to the OJR server; the time at which you requested a file; the name of the file or files you requested; the Internet address of the website from which you were "referred" (for example, the page you were looking at when you clicked on a link that brought you to the OJR.org website); any search terms or keywords that you may have used in the search engine which directed you to this site; and your Internet browser and platform (Firefox, Linux, Windows XP, etc).

Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information, such as the country of origin of our visitors. While the pages you choose to browse are linked in our log files to your computer's IP, this information is not connected to your email address. None of the automatically collected data identifies you as a person.

This site contains links to other sites. OJR.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
