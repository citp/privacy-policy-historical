    1. **Information You Provide To Us**

Personal Information and Demographic Information. On the Sites, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, credit card number, and physical address ("Personal Information"); and (2) demographic information, such as gender or similar information ("Demographic Information"). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Sites, including account registration forms, e-mail newsletter sign-ups, or when you submit information, communicate or otherwise interact with us. If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

    2. **Information We Collect or Store As You Access And Use The Sites**

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Sites including your media consumption (e.g., video viewing and audio consumption) activities on or through the Sites ("Usage Information"). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone (a "Device") whenever you visit or interact with our Sites. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information. 

This Usage Information may include: 

      * your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Sites, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
      * your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
      * the URL that referred you to our Sites;
      * the areas within our Sites that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;
      * your Device location;
      * your Device characteristics; and
      * certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.
We may use various developed methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information ("Tracking Technologies"). A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed): 

**_Cookies_**. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's web site, [www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com/). Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Sites may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Sites your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. 

**_Mobile Device Identifiers_**. Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such device information if you access the Sites through mobile devices. Certain features of our Sites may require collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive this information. 

**_Web Beacons_**. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our Sites' pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. 

**_Embedded Scripts_**. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 

**_ETag or entity tag_**. ETags or entity tags are a feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and HTML5 cookies. 

We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including: 

**_Strictly Necessary_**. We may use cookies or other technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Sites, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping-cart functionality. 

**_Performance-Related_**. We may use cookies or other technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Sites, including as part of our web site analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Sites. 

**_Functionality-Related_**. We may use cookies or other technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Sites, including identifying you when you sign-in to our Sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our Sites. 

**_Advertising-Related_**. We may use cookies or other technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our Sites and third-party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content. This includes using cookies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. Further information on this is found in Section 6 below. 

We obtain your consent to our information storage or collection Tracking Technologies by providing you with transparent information in our Privacy Policy and providing you with the opportunity to make your choice. Please note that we are not required to obtain your express consent to the information collection technologies identified above that are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Sites. Other than Tracking Technologies that are Strictly Necessary (as defined above), you have the right to object to the use of our other information storage or collection technologies by contacting us at: [techsupport@own.oprah.com](mailto:techsupport@own.oprah.com). Further information on this right for advertising-related technologies is found in Section 6 below.

    3. **Information Third Parties Provide About You**

We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Sites with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. We will apply this Privacy Policy to such information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Sites, and if information collected on and off the Sites is combined to the extent we combine it with Personal Information, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Sites and other web sites you have visited. Third party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to ensure that you are provided with the necessary information and are provided with the opportunity to make your choice. The relevant third party's terms of use, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks. 

While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Sites, you may wish to visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members in the U.S.A.

Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.

  8. **What About Consent To Transfer Information to The United States?**

The Sites are operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States (which include the District of Columbia and territories and possessions). If you are located in the European Union, Canada or anywhere else outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including, without limitation, Personal Information, will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States.
