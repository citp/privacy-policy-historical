#### Opera’s built-in Web search

Opera has a built-in Web-search feature. This gives the user the option to utilize external Web search engines directly from the browser interface. Opera relies on third parties for this service. The Opera Web browser sends the user’s search requests (in a specially designed URL string) directly to third-party Web sites that handle the actual search queries. What is sent to the third-party site is only the information needed to perform the particular search query. No personal information is sent.

Some third-party sites may monitor data traffic from copies of the Opera Web browser, such as numbers of hits and the search terms used. No personally identifiable information is made available to these services by the Opera Mini browser nor by Opera Software.

Please note: Opera Software does not control the privacy and security practices and policies of these third parties and their sites. Check the particular site and/or business for more information.

### Opera’s geolocation support

Opera browsers with support for [geolocation](https://web.archive.org/products/geolocation/) enable users to share their geographic location with websites. If the user chooses to share their location with a web service, they have to enable geolocation support. The location service is provided by Google and is governed by [Google’s privacy policy](http://m.google.com/privacy). The requesting websites’ use of your location is governed by the respective websites’ privacy policies. Opera encourages users only to share their location with websites they trust.

If you use those services, Google receives information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Opera does not receive or store any location information. Google returns your location (longitude, latitude and accuracy) and your location is made available to the website by the Opera browser through the W3C Geolocation API.

### Privacy in the Opera Mini browser
