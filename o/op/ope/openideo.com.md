**2\. A Note Regarding Children and Minors**

Users under the age of 13 may not use the Site. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from users under the age of 13 ("Child" or "Children"), and neither does our third-party partner, OI Engine , who handles our accounts. If IDEO or OI Engine learn that a Child's Personal Information has been collected, we will delete the account and all Personal Information associated with it. If parents or guardians believe that IDEO or OI Engine have unintentionally collected their Child's Personal Information, then they should contact us and request the deletion of the information at hello@openideo.com or:

IDEO LP

Attn:  OpenIDEO re Minor Account

Pier 28 Annex, 501 The Embarcadero

San Francisco, CA  94105

Users under the age of 18 cannot enter into an agreement with IDEO and we ask that they do not submit any Personal Information to us. The parents or legal guardians of users under the age of 18 must register on the Site, agree to the TOU  and enter into the agreement with IDEO.

Pursuant to California's Digital Online Eraser Law (California Senate Bill 568), users under the age of 18 have the right to remove, or request the removal of, content or information they have posted on the Site. Please be advised that any information you post to a bulletin board, message board, chat room, community, or other forum is publicly viewable. We strongly recommend that all users avoid posting personal or sensitive information at any time. 

Deleting an Account: Should you wish to delete your account, you are able to do so by contacting us at hello@openideo.com and providing us with your request to delete, your username, and typing "Digital Online Eraser Law Deletion Request" in the subject line.

Deleting or Editing a Comment: Should you wish to delete or edit a comment on the Site, you may do so. Once you post a comment, the date of the post will appear on the right hand side of the comment. If you hover over this date, it will reveal a drop down box with the options to “Edit” or “Delete” the comment.

Removal of this content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal. After your removal request has been honored, we may retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our servers. We are not required to remove your posted content or information if it has been rendered anonymous or if we are required by law to retain it.

**3\. Information We Collect**

Our primary purpose in collecting your first name, email address, username, password and general location when you register to the Site (the “Login Information”) is to:  (i) provide you with a safe, smooth, and efficient experience, (ii) be able to contact you in connection with any Contributions and information that you submit, (iii) administer your account, and (iv) communicate with our users or schedule any technical work to the Site with minimal interference, by trying to consider user time zones. Any information about you that can be used to contact or identify you is personal information ("Personal Information"). We only collect the minimum amount of Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving the aforementioned purposes. Your email address is not displayed publicly on the Site but it will be displayed to Organizers (as defined in the [TOU](https://challenges.openideo.com/terms)) .

If you register to the Site using ‘Facebook Connect’ or ‘Google+’ the following information, if it has been made publicly available by you, will be stored on our servers as your Login Information – Facebook or Google ID, first and last name, email address, country, locale, gender and date of birth. Additionally your Facebook or Google Profile Picture becomes part of your Login Information but is not stored by us. Your Facebook or Google ID will be your username for the Site.

Your Login Information is held within your account called My Profile. This is (i) created when you register on the Site, (ii) added to at will by you the user, and (iii) includes your Design Quotient. Your “Design Quotient” (or “DQ”) is a profile of you that we derive based on your Contributions, other users’ feedback on your Contributions, and your Applause of other Entrant’s Contributions for Challenges. Your DQ is published on the Site, accessible on each page of the Site, and visible to other users unless you choose to make it private (an option available in My Profile).

It is each user’s decision as to whether they add additional Personal Information to their My Profile section or upload a photograph/image of themselves and opt to make these visible to other users as part of My Profile. The image/photo/picture, first and last name, gender and date of birth from Facebook Connect or Google+ (if used) can be made private by deletion at each User’s discretion. Your Facebook or Google ID is not visible in My Profile but can appear in your My Profile URL.

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. Once you register, create My Profile, or submit a Contribution for a Challenge you are not anonymous to us. As only Entrants can submit a Contribution on the Site, if you choose to submit a Contribution prior to registering to the Site, we will require you to first (i) register with your Login Information thus creating My Profile and then (ii) become an Entrant by agreeing to the Challenge Rules. All Contributions will be viewable by other Users of the Site. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to register or submit a Contribution or Applause.

If you register and create My Profile, choose to submit Contributions or Applause, or post messages on the Site, we will collect and store that information you provide to us. We retain this information for the purposes of the Site and as necessary to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems as permitted or required by law.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other Users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

4\. Our Use of Your Information

We use your Login Information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to:

  * Contact you about any Contributions
  * Contact you with Notifications
  * Troubleshoot problems and resolve disputes
  * Detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity
  * Enforce the [TOU](https://challenges.openideo.com/terms) , and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.



We may use your Login Information to contact you with information about new features and updates about the Site and OpenIDEO, and other information that you have expressed may be of interest to you (i.e. OpenIDEO or affiliate newsletters, additional information regarding IDEO-affiliated entities or websites, etc.).

We may share aggregated information that does not include Login Information and we may otherwise disclose information that does not identify you (“Non-Identifying Information”) and information about your activities on the Site (“Log Data”) with third-parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, academic research, and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

You agree that we may use your Login Information to contact you. By accepting the [TOU ](https://challenges.openideo.com/terms), you expressly agree that we may contact you as provided herein.

5\. Our Disclosure of Your Information

IDEO may disclose information it has collected from you and/or Contributions you have made available on the Site when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of IDEO or Challenge Hosts or others. As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your Personal Information to third parties without your explicit consent. The following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed in the normal scope of our business and you authorize us to do this for the purposes of the use, operation any investigations of the information on the Site.

Challenge Host: A Challenge Host (other than IDEO) cannot store or disclose your Personal Information; this can only be done by IDEO in compliance with this Privacy Policy. IDEO may share information that you have entered in My Profile with a Challenge Host to analyze Entrants’ Contributions, comments and Applause for the Challenge Host’s own Challenge(s).

Service Providers for Our Operations: We may use third parties, such as [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy), that we refer to as service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of our business, including as part of our registration process or to facilitate our mailing lists. Therefore we may provide some of your Personal Information directly to these service providers, or this information may come available to them in the course of our business with them. We recommend you review the privacy policies of these service providers.

Other Corporate Entities: We may share our data, including Personal Information about you, with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and branch offices in the United States and internationally. To the extent these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their users. To the extent allowed by applicable law, these entities follow privacy practices that are no less protective of users than the practices described in this Privacy Policy. IDEO may share some or all of your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Data and Log Data with another business entity should we plan to reorganize, spin out, merge with, acquire, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such an event occur, we will require that the new or combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information. If your Personal Information will be used contrary to this Privacy Policy, you will receive prior notice as previously described.

Legal Requests: IDEO cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws and intellectual property rights. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can disclose Login Information including name and email address, and without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or to report suspected illegal activity. 

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other Personal Information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example and without limiting the foregoing, we may be forced to disclose your Personal Information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information or private communications will always remain private.

6\. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information

You agree to maintain and promptly update and keep accurate, current and complete any information provided to IDEO as part of My Profile. You can change your username, email address, password, contact and other information by going to My Profile. Your previous Contributions, your Applause and your Design Quotient will be associated with the updated information. 

You are given the option to make most parts of your personal profile available to other users. If you do so, be aware that other users can object to any content on My Profile if they believe it is damaging or offensive. Your recent Contributions and current and past Challenges are shown on your My Profile page. You have the option to make your Design Quotient private to other users.

If you would like us to delete your account record in our system, please contact us at [hello@openideo.com](mailto:hello@openideo.com) with a request that we delete the Login Information you are required to provide to establish an account from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Also, if you have included Login Information in online forum postings or in information or communications shared with other users, you may not be able to update, correct or delete this information from the Site.

7\. Control of Your Password 

You are responsible for all actions taken with your Login Information and My Profile. Accordingly, you agree to maintain and safeguard the confidentiality of your Login Information, and to not share your Login Information with any third party. We recommend that you do not disclose your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your username and password or your Personal Information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party’s privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your Personal Information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password as detailed in the above section - Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information. If you need help changing your password, please contact hello@openideo.com.

8\. Other Information Collectors

Except as expressly stated in the Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you via the Site. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties on our Site or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or the disclosure of information you disclose to them. Since IDEO does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your Personal Information to others.

9\. Security

Your information is stored on our service provider’s servers in the USA. For more information regarding these services, including the security of the servers, please see Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service (Amazon EC2 - <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>) in conjunction with Amazon S3 storage (<http://aws.amazon.com/s3/>) and Amazon CloudFront services (<http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/>). These service providers have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of Personal Information collected through the Site.

We use reasonable physical, procedural, technical and administrative security measures to protect your Personal Information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Your information is also stored on our service provider’s servers, and we encourage you to review their terms of service agreements and privacy policies before providing information to them. In the event there is a data breach involving unencrypted Personal Information, we or OI Engine will notify you via email and/or by posting a notice on the affected website.

10\. Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of this Site who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As previously stated, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes or otherwise, unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. However, if you believe your information has been shared or you have general questions about how your information may have been shared, you may contact us at:

11\. EU Users

IDEO is committed to complying with applicable European Union (“EU”) privacy laws. Because IDEO is a US-based company, using certain US providers (please see above), some of your Personal Information will be stored or accessed in the US, which has a lower standard of protection for Personal Information than the EU. IDEO has ensured that our non-EU based providers have committed to certain mechanisms including contracts with us which would allow you to address and have redress against any concerns you have regarding the transfer and security of your information outside of the EU. In agreeing to our Privacy Policy, you indicate your consent to such transfers of your Personal Information out of the EU.
