 **Embedded content from other websites**

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

 **Who we share your data with:**

We do not share your data with anyone, unless required to do so for legal reasons.

 **How long we retain your data:**

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

 **What rights you have over your data:**

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

 **Where we send your data:**

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

 **Security of your personal data:**

We follow strict security procedures in the storage of your personal data, and to protect it against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

 **Advertisements:**

The advertising on our website is provided by third parties. If you choose to interact with any such advertising then the advertiser may provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you click on or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.
