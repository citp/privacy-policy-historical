    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This website, <a href="http://www.openmedia.ca" title="http://www.openmedia.ca">http://www.openmedia.ca</a> (the "Site") is operated by OpenMedia.ca ("We" or "Us"). OpenMedia.ca is the operating name of the "OpenMedia Engagement Network," a non-profit organization legally incorporated.</p>
<p>OpenMedia.ca is strongly committed to protecting your privacy online.</p>
<h2>Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>OpenMedia.ca will send you updates by e-mail. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by replying to an email, or sending a message to <a href="mailto:contact@openmedia.ca">contact@openmedia.ca</a> with the subject heading "UNSUBSCRIBE".</p>
<p>We do not share the information you’ve given us with unaffiliated groups without your explicit permission. We may share some of your personal information with the following affiliated groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affiliated Third Parties – for example, our database administrators – for the sole purpose of helping Us do our work. These groups do not share your personal information or use it for any purpose other than as instructed by Us.</li>
<li>Third Party Administrators, such as organizations we engage to facilitate large distribution of messages. The content of these emails will be from OpenMedia.ca and these third parties do not have direct access to your personally identifiable information.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, with your explicit permission, we pass along certain of your information to the following groups (as is standard practice):</p>
<ul>
<li>Canadian policy-makers, communications companies, news publications and other targets when you choose to use our email tool to send them messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>By explicit permission we mean, in each instance, we will ask additional permission from you before passing along information. This additional permission will set out the parties with which we wish to share your information and the purposes for which we intend to do so. We will also require from you some positive indication to demonstrate you have assented to the disclosure of information. The most typical example of this would be a letter campaign, where you enter your information into an internet based form beside a message and click 'Send Your Message'. The parties to whom you will be 'sending your message' will be listed.</p>
<p>When you give OpenMedia.ca personal information, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, OpenMedia.ca cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
<p>Each time you visit this Site or provide us with information through the Site, by doing so you are accepting practices described in the privacy policy. You are also accepting our specific rules or terms of use which may be posted on specific sections of the Site, including areas for making donations, signing petitions, or sending emails.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to transactions and activities in which you engage and data gathered only on the Site. This privacy policy does not apply to pages hosted by other organizations to which we may link, as their privacy policies may differ, nor does it apply to any offline contact between you and OpenMedia.ca.</p>
<h2>Petitions and Email Campaigns</h2>
<p>For petitions and email campaigns in which you've participated, we treat your name, location, and comments as public information—for example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to Canadian policy makers and other targets, or to the press. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to the designated target as part of a petition. This is a standard industry practice in such situations. In no such case will we disclose your email address or phone number, without your permission. OpenMedia.ca is not responsible for the use of your email address by campaign targets.</p>
<h2>Sending Emails Via OpenMedia.ca</h2>
<p>In certain cases, we enable you to send individual e-mails to Canadian policy makers through our website. These messages are sent in your name, with your e-mail address as the return address and your full name and contact information is provided as part of the submission. These messages will only be sent out under your name as you approve them on an individual basis using our email tool. You are solely responsible for the specific message(s) you send using our email tool. OpenMedia.ca takes no responsibility for the content of use of your email address by campaign targets.</p>
<h2>Financial Donations</h2>
<p>If you choose to make a donation to OpenMedia.ca, your credit card information will be used only for this transaction through our secure online payment system. </p>
<h2>Phone Campaigns</h2>
<p>From time to time, the OpenMedia.ca may contact you by telephone. If you would like to be removed permanently from our phone list, please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@openmedia.ca">contact@openmedia.ca</a> with the subject line "UNSUBSCRIBE PHONE NUMBER". Please allow 8-10 business days for your information to be removed.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>OpenMedia.ca does not solicit personally identifying information from children. Visitors who are under 13 years of age should ask their parent or legal guardian for assistance when using the Site and should not submit any personally identifying information to the Site.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>

We will use a cookie (cookies reside on your computer and are under the control of your browser) to enable you to return to password-protected areas of the website without having to re-enter your password. If you wish to disable these cookies, the help portion of the tool bar on most browsers will tell you how do that. If you set your browser to disable cookies, however, you may not be able to access certain parts of this Site.</p>
<h2>Data Tracking</h2>
<p>In order to better serve our members, we use cookies and periodically analyze web logs. We may collect IP addresses to better understand where our traffic is coming from, and to provide customized services to members. We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our website. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates and click-through rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to OpenMedia.ca supporters.</p>
