# Opera's Privacy Statement

The Opera browser offers you excellent features for the protection of your privacy and security when using Opera in the internet environment. Opera Software has also created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This document refers to three distinct areas. Please note that personally-identifying information that is collected directly by Opera Software is not shared with any other parties.

  * Privacy in the Opera 5 and Opera 6 desktop browsers
  * Privacy on our web sites
  * Privacy of customer data



## Privacy in the Opera 5 and Opera 6 desktop browsers

Introduced in Opera 5 was an advertising banner window in the program interface. Opera 6 contains the same technology. Opera Software has taken much care in the development so that user privacy and security are not compromised. No personally-identifying information is collected or shared, and providing ad profile information in the browser is strictly optional. The Opera user's web usage is not tracked. What is recorded and shared with the advertising service provider is the user's interaction with the relative banner advertising. The company which provides advertising services is [Cydoor](http://www.cydoor.com/). For more information see the links below.

  * Technical details: [Advertising Implementation in Opera 5 and 6](http://www.opera.com/opera5/ads.html)



Also introduced in Opera 5, and present in Opera 6 is a built-in web search feature. This gives the user the option to utilize external web search engines directly from the browser interface. Opera relies on third parties for this service. Follow the link below for more information about Opera's search feature.
