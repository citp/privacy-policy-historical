###  Privacy in the Opera web browser

Opera has taken much care in the development process so that user privacy and security are not compromised. No personal information is collected or shared. The Opera user’s web usage is not tracked.

Opera browser for computers: Your installation of Opera browser for desktop contains a unique ID that can not be linked to you as an individual person. This unique ID is required for auto-updates of the software and any installed extensions. Data about the features (not websites) used in Opera browser is collected with the purpose to improve the software and associated services. The software also creates a unique ID that is linked to your computer. This unique ID is processed with the sole purpose to measure marketing campaigns and distribution partners. Any crash logs sent by Opera browser will include the version number of the software and information about the operating system. This information is collected with the sole purpose to improve the software. Crash logs are automatically sent by default. To disable this feature select Opera > Preferences and untick “Automatically send crash reports to Opera”.

Opera for Android uses Google Analytics on Android to track referred installations to measure effects of marketing campaigns. No personal identifiable information is collected.

#### Opera’s built-in web search

Opera has a built-in web-search feature. This gives the user the option to utilize external web search engines directly from the browser interface. Opera relies on third parties for this service. The Opera web browser sends the user’s search requests (in a specially designed URL string) directly to third-party websites that handle the actual search queries. What is sent to the third-party site is only the information needed to perform the particular search query. No personal information is sent.

Some third-party sites may monitor data traffic from copies of the Opera web browser, such as numbers of hits and the search terms used. No personally identifiable information is made available to these services by the Opera Mini browser nor by Opera.

Please note: Opera does not control the privacy and security practices and policies of these third parties and their sites. Check the particular site and/or business for more information. It is the responsibility of the browser user to use caution before sharing personal information via forms and other methods used by third parties and their websites.

###  Login using social services

Opera allows you to enable synchronization of browser data such as your Speed Dial entries between Opera browsers on the devices you are using, by logging in using Facebook, Google, Twitter or by creating an Opera account. Opera collects data submitted by you, and your name, username, email address and language if provided by the social service you use to log in. The data is processed with the sole purpose to enable synchronization of browser data, including debugging, improvements and optimization. Data received for a social service may be retained for up to six months after you stopped using the synchronization feature.

###  Privacy in Opera Link/synchronization

Opera Link allows registered users to synchronize some data, such as bookmarks, among their Opera web browser and Opera Mini web browsers. Opera will never disclose, share, or distribute an individual’s linked data to any third party except where required by law or regulation, or in cases where you have chosen to grant access to your data to an Opera or third party application or service using Opera Link API. Opera restricts internal access to this information exclusively to those who need it for the operation of the Link service. Information user synchronizes may be stored outside of the country in which the user resides, and user hereby consents to such storage and transfer of information between jurisdictions.

Opera may retain IP addresses, user ID, and anonymous traffic data as may be useful in the debugging, optimization, and ongoing improvement of this service.

###  Privacy in Opera Turbo

When Opera Turbo is enabled, the service will compress network traffic, thereby increasing download speed and reducing data volume. The service requests normal Web content through an Opera proxy server. Opera Turbo will exclude Web pages located on an intranet or by using secure connections (HTTPS). Opera collects IP addresses, usage patterns, and the point in time at which the service is used for the purpose debugging, maintenance, optimization of the service, or maintaining the customer relationship. Analysis of service usage is conducted by aggregating data, anonymizing individual identities.

###  Opera’s geolocation support

Opera browsers with support for [geolocation](http://help.opera.com/Mac/12.10/en/geolocation.html) enable users to share their geographic location with websites. If the user chooses to share their location with a web service, they have to enable geolocation support. The location service is provided by Google and is governed by [Google’s privacy policy](http://m.google.com/privacy). The requesting websites’ use of your location is governed by the respective websites’ privacy policies. Opera encourages users only to share their location with websites they trust.

If you use those services, Google receives information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Opera does not receive or store any location information. Google returns your location (longitude, latitude and accuracy) and your location is made available to the website by the Opera browser through the W3C Geolocation API.
