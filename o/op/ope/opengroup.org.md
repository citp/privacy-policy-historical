# About The Open Group: Boundaryless Information Flow through interoperability

  
Privacy Statement   
At The Open Group, we know how important personal privacy is to you. Because of our interest in protecting your privacy, we have adopted the following privacy principles: 

Your Expectation of Privacy   
We recognize that you expect privacy and security for your personal and company affairs. We understand the need to safeguard your sensitive information that you have entrusted to us. We maintain standards and procedures designed to prevent misuse of this information. 

Collection, Retention, and Use of Information about You   
We collect, retain, and use information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business, communicate with you or provide products, services, and other information to you. We collect and retain information about you only for specific business purposes – and we will tell you why we are collecting and retaining it upon request. We use that information to protect and administer your records, to comply with certain laws and regulations; to help us design or improve our products and services; so that we can provide you with quality products and superior service. 

Maintenance of Accurate Information   
We have procedures to help assure that your information is accurate, current, and complete in accordance with commercial standards. We also have procedures to respond to your requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner. Whilst some of these procedures are required by law, we have implemented additional procedures to maintain accurate, current, and complete information, including processes to update information and remove old information. 

Limiting Employee Access to Information   
We have procedures that limit employee access to personally identifiable information to those employees with a business reason to know such information about you. We educate our employees about the importance of confidentiality privacy through standard operating procedures, and our policies on ethics. 

Security Procedures to Protect Information 

We maintain security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information about you. We update and test our technology to improve the protection of our information about you and to ensure the integrity of our information. 

Disclosing Information Outside The Open Group   
We do not reveal specific information about your company or personally identifiable data to parties outside our business associates unless it is lawfully permitted or required. We do not provide account or personal information outside The Open Group and its associates for the purpose of independent telemarketing or direct mail marketing of any products or services. 

Maintaining Your Privacy in Business Relationships   
Sometimes it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about you to a party outside our company, such as to a vendor or service company that we use to provide support or services for one or more of our products. These vendors and service companies agree to safeguard our confidential information about you and your company with us and must abide by applicable. 

Our Privacy Commitment to You   
We want you to understand our commitment to personal privacy and our use of information. These materials will answer most of the important questions that you may have about how we gather, protect, and use information. If you still have questions please email us  [email](https://web.archive.org/nospam?webemail-legal)

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time.
