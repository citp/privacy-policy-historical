<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>


<p>The Opera browser offers you excellent features for the protection of your 
privacy and security when using Opera in the internet environment. Opera 
Software has also created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our 
firm commitment to privacy. This document refers to three distinct areas. 
Please note that personally-identifying information that is collected directly 
by Opera Software is not shared with any other parties.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#opera5">Privacy in the Opera 5 browser</a></li>
<li><a href="#websites">Privacy on our web sites</a></li>
<li><a href="#internal">Privacy of customer data</a></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="opera5">Privacy in the Opera 5 browser</h2>

<p>See the following documents for privacy information regarding advertising 
in the Opera 5 browser:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overview: <a href="adinfo.html">Privacy, Security, and Advertising in 
    Opera 5</a></li>
<li>Technical details: <a href="../opera5/ads.html">Advertising Implementation 
    in Opera 5</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With Opera 5 is the introduction of an advertising banner window in the 
program interface. Opera Software has taken much care in the development so 
that user privacy and security are not compromised. No personally-identifying 
information is collected or shared, and providing ad profile information in 
the browser is strictly optional. The Opera user's web usage is not tracked. 
What is recorded and shared with the advertising service provider is the 
user's interaction with the relative banner advertising. The company which 
provides advertising services is <a href="http://www.cydoor.com">Cydoor</a>. 
For more information see the above links.</p>

<h3>Collection of Data</h3>

<h4>IP Addresses</h4>
<p>Opera Software will on occasion collect visitors' IP addresses to help 
diagnose problems with servers and to administer Web sites. IP addresses will 
not be used for any purposes other than these.</p>

<h4>Information Collected from Purchase and Information Request Forms</h4>
<p>Opera.com, Opera.no, and OperaSoftware.com use forms for visitors to request 
information, products, and services. Depending on the the service, product, or 
information visitors request, visitors' contact information (e.g. e-mail addresses 
or telephone numbers) or financial information (e.g. credit card numbers) may 
be collected. Contact information from these forms is used to send orders and 
information about Opera Software to customers. Visitors' contact information 
is also used to get in touch with them when necessary. Visitors may opt-out 
of receiving future mailings; see the <a href="#optout">choice/opt-out</a> 
section. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user 
for products and services.</p>

<h4>Survey Data</h4>
<p>Opera Software's online surveys ask visitors for demographic information 
(e.g. age, internet usage, or income level). This is not personally-identifying 
information and is used to tailor visitors' experience at Opera.com, Opera.no, 
and OperaSoftware.com. This non-personally-identifying information is also 
shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</p>

<h4>Contests</h4>
<p>Opera Software runs contests on Opera.com, Opera.no, and OperaSoftware.com 
in which visitors are requested to provide contact information (e.g. e-mail 
addresses). Visitors' contact information is used to contact the visitor when 
necessary. This information will not be shared with or sold to other parties. 
Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the 
<a href="#optout">choice/opt-out</a> section.</p>

<h4>Advertisement on our web sites</h4>
<p>Opera Software uses an outside ad company to display ads on its web sites. 
These ads may contain cookies that appear to be coming from Opera Software's 
sites, but in reality the cookies are coming from partner sites. Opera.com, 
Opera.no, and OperaSoftware.com do not use cookies. Opera Software does not 
have access to any information about visitors from cookies received while 
visiting Opera Software's sites.</p>

<h4>Public Forums</h4>

visitors. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas 
becomes public information and visitors should exercise caution when deciding 
to disclose personal information.</p>

<h3>Unsubscribing from Mailings</h3>

<a href="#optout">choice/opt-out section</a>.</p>
