Privacy and Security Information

Privacy and Security

Open Text is committed to protecting your personal information. This statement explains our practices for this Web site. 

What Personal Information We Gather

We gather personal information that we need to know when you ask us to do something for you. For example, if you ask us to send you NewsLink, our monthly newsletter, we need to know and store your e-mail address. We will always ask for your permission and tell you how we're going to use your personal information first. You can always choose not to provide it. 

How We Use It

We only use the personal information we gather for the purposes to which you have agreed, for example, to send you a newsletter. We do not collect personal information about any of our site's visitors unless the visitor authorizes us to do so. 

Who Has Access to It

Only people who need to access your personal information can access it; for example, the people who send a newsletter need to know your e-mail address. 

How We Share It

We do not sell or provide your personal information to any third parties. 

We might share your personal information under the following circumstances: 

How You Change or Remove It

You have access to your personal information that we retain. We try to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. If you'd like to change, correct or remove your personal information, please [contact us.](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact_us.html)

Security

We use current security measures to safeguard your personal information. 

Credit Cards

We do accept credit card payments for registrations. If someone uses your credit card to make an unauthorized purchase, check with the institution that issued your card to find out what the exact liability is. 

E-mail

If you send us an e-mail, we may save it if we think we'll need it to communicate back with you. We never sell or share e-mail addresses. 

Remember, e-mail is not a secure way to send personal information because e-mail is not encrypted. Please don't send any personal information to us over e-mail; use our secure forms

Cookies

A "cookie" is a small text file that may be created on your PC when you visit a Web site (if your computer accepts cookies). If a cookie exists, it may be read when you return to the site for a subsequent visit. 

We use cookies in these situations. 

You will still be able to use this Web site if you have cookies disabled but some functionality may not be available. 

Java and Javascript

Java is a programming language that allows different kinds of computers to talk to each other. We use Java technology to provide functionality such as navigation menus, forms and so on. You will still be able to use this Web site if you have Java or Javascript disabled but some functionality may not be available. 

Changes to this Statement

We may amend this privacy and security statement from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on this Web site.
