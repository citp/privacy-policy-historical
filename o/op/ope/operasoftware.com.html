<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>
The Opera browser offers you excellent features for the protection of your 
privacy and security when using Opera in the internet environment. Opera 
Software has also created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our 
firm commitment to privacy. This document refers to three distinct areas. 
Please note that  personal information 
that is collected directly by Opera Software is not shared with any other 
parties.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#opera">Privacy in the Opera desktop browser</a></li>
<li><a href="#websites">Privacy on our Web sites</a></li>
<li><a href="#internal">Privacy of customer data</a></li>
</ul>




<h2 id="opera">Privacy in the opera desktop browser</h2>

<p>
The advertising banner in Opera was first introduced with the launch 
of Opera 5 in December 2000. All of Opera's desktop browsers now 
include this technology. Opera Software has taken much care in the 
development so that user privacy and security are not compromised. No 
personal information is collected or shared, and providing ad profile 
information in the browser is strictly optional. The Opera user's Web 
usage is not tracked. What is recorded and shared with the advertising 
service provider (Advertising.com) is the user's interaction with the 
relative banner advertising. Please see links below for more 
information about the company that provides the advertising in Opera.
</p>


<h3>Opera's built-in Web search</h3>

<p>
Opera has a built-in Web search feature introduced in Opera 5. This 
gives the user the option to utilize external Web search engines 
directly from the browser interface. Opera relies on third parties for 
this service. Follow the link below for more information about Opera's 
search feature.
</p>
