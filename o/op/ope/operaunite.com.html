  <p>Some third-party sites may monitor data traffic from copies of the Opera Web browser, such as numbers of hits and the search terms used. No personally identifiable information is made available to these services by the Opera Mini browser nor by Opera Software.</p>

What is sent to the third-party site is the special Opera Mini search string along with the text terms needed to perform the particular search query. No personal information is sent.</p>

  <p>When using the built-in, search-related features, Opera Mini will receive cookies, including third-party cookies, from third- party sites. These can be removed using <em>Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy</em> from the menu in Opera Mini.</p>

  <p>Some third-party sites may monitor data traffic from copies of the Opera Mini browser, such as numbers of hits and the search terms used. No personally identifiable information is made available to these services by the Opera Mini browser nor by Opera Software.</p>

  <p><a href="#top" class="top">Top</a></p>

  <h3 class="separator" id="operaturbo">Privacy in Opera Turbo</h3>

  <p>When Opera Turbo is enabled, the service will compress network traffic, thereby increasing download speed and reducing data volume.
