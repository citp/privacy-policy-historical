<a name="email"></a>
<h3>Your Choices About Receiving E-Mail</h3>

<p>Red Hat makes every effort to provide you with the ability to opt-in and opt-out of receiving communications from Red Hat and/or its partners.</p>

<p>Red Hat may send you e-mail about your account, about the products you have purchased, to remind you about a webcast for which you have registered or a service you have purchased, or in response to your questions.  Red Hat may also send you e-mail with information and/or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you, unless you indicate that you do not want to receive them.  In addition, with your assent, our business partners may send you such information.</p>

<p>You may let us know whether or not you would like to receive information, special offers, and promotional materials from Red Hat or our business partners when you create a redhat.com account, when you register for a service, when you provide us with your personal information, or when we send you e-mail.  Please note that if you choose not to accept promotional e-mails, you may not receive special offers that may be of value to you.</p>

<p>Red Hat will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of any of our direct marketing communications at any time.  All promotional e-mail sent from Red Hat will contain a provision allowing you the option to decline receiving future promotional e-mail.  You may unsubscribe to an e-mail communication by contacting Red Hat at either of the addresses provided below and requesting that you be unsubscribed from that specific communication:</p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3>

<p>Red Hat trains its employees on our privacy policy guidelines and makes our privacy policy available to our business partners.  Our website uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal information when you send your personal information on our website.

Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information.  Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.  Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, Red Hat reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the forum's integrity, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate.</p>

<a name="sprogs"></a>
<h3>Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy</h3>

<p>Out of special concern for children's privacy, Red Hat does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13.

Red Hat does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.</p>

In addition, Red Hat will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.</p>
