<p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect through the Openbucks Service, how we use such information and to whom and under what circumstances we may disclose it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and made a part of, the Openbucks Terms of Use, and capitalized terms used and not defined in this policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms. By using the Openbucks Service, you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Openbucks Service.</p>
<h1>Information Collection</h1>
<h2>Information You Provide To Us</h2>
<p>We collect personal information and non-public personal information from you when you affirmatively provide it to us, such as when you provide information on an Openbucks Merchant interface, register at the Openbucks Site or contact us. “Nonpublic personal information” is generally information about you that we may obtain in connection with providing you the Openbucks Service and that is not available in public records. You may provide us with both publically accessible and non-public personal information including your name, address, email address, telephone number, cell phone number, payment information including credit card and/or Gift Card details, and/or Openbucks login and password information. We may combine the information you provide us with information we receive about you from other online and offline sources.</p>
<h2>Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
<p>When you use the Openbucks Service, we collect certain information from you, including but not limited to your browser type, operating system, IP address, device ID, Internet service provider, search query you may have used to find Openbucks through a search engine, and the web site access immediately before and after the Openbucks Service. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you access the Openbucks Service, the amount of time you spend using the Openbucks Service, the number of times you return to the Openbucks Service and other clickstream information. We may combine this information with the personal information you provide to us.</p>
<p>We (or service providers working on our behalf) may use cookies and web beacons (also called “pixel tags” or “clear gifs”) to collect the non-personal information described above. A cookie is a small text file that may be stored on the hard drive of your computer when you access the Openbucks Service. A web beacon is a tiny graphic image that we place on the Openbucks Service, in our emails and in the advertisements we place on other websites. We or our service providers may also use cookies and web beacons: (1) to recognize you when you return to the Openbucks Service; (2) to provide you with customized content and information; (3) to measure the effectiveness of the Openbucks Service; (4) to monitor Openbucks Service usage; (5) monitor aggregate metrics such as traffic and demographic patterns; (6) to conduct research to improve our content and services; and (7) for other internal business purposes. You are free to decline or delete cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Openbucks Service or take full advantage of all of our offerings. Check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Blocking certain cookies will also block the use of certain web beacons.</p>
<p>We may also use third-party advertising service providers, who may use cookies and web beacons to track your behavior on the Openbucks Service. These service providers may use this information, together with anonymous information about you that they receive from us, to deliver targeted advertisements to you when you are on this Openbucks Service or one or more of the other websites where they deliver targeted advertisements.</p>
<h2>Information Collected by Third Parties</h2>
<p>We may collect information from you when you use our services through the Openbucks Merchant Interface or on another company’s website or on a co-branded website. All information that we collect through such websites is subject to this Privacy Policy. All of the information collected is owned and controlled by Openbucks. We may share some of your transactional information and your name and email address in order for our partner to fulfill all or part of your order. Please note that the information you submit on such a website may alternatively be subject to the privacy policy applicable to that site.</p>

Choosing to withhold or remove certain information may interfere with your ability to utilize the Openbucks Service to its fullest potential.

<h1>Our Commitment to Data Security</h1>
<p>We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
