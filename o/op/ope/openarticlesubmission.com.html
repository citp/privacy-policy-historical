The extreme end of fashion designing seems to be the most outrageous out of all the forms of art that exist in the world today. Imagine walking down a ramp with a whole bunch of fruit stuck to your head. Where is the sense in that? You better refrain from making such a statement in front of the fashion freaks because they’ll just give you the look and say this poor non-liberated soul doesn’t know anything about fashion. The only fashion that is always going to be in is orderly fashion. Orderly fashion is that which works within the boundaries of comfort, modesty and elegance">Fashion</a>

The importance of keeping yourself healthy cannot be overstressed. This is because if you have everything in the world and lack good health it is as if you have nothing. And if despite losing everything you have good health it is as if you have everything. Because with your health in tact you will be able to work your way back to normal if you persevere. But if you are rich and unhealthy then remember that money can buy you medication but it cant buy you health">Health and Fitness</a>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-2125"><a href="http://openarticlesubmission.com/category/oas/home-family/" title="The importance of family life cannot be overstressed for the development of a humane society. The family system forms the core of human civilization. The situation today is very saddening as the term family has lost its meaning. The evils that have taken over our social life can all be traced back to the lack of proper family socialization. People from good homes and decent families are supposed to maintain a certain standard of moral conduct. But when the family system is shaken to the floor you have no such discipline in society. Man by nature is weak and tends to succumb to evil if he is not constantly encouraged to do good deeds">Home and Family</a>

The real question is who are they? And what gives them the right to say all these things and why do we have to accept them anyways? I heard “they” are all those old wise men that have gone down over the ages and these sayings that we have are their golden thoughts put into golden words. They then are dead and gone and times have changed and most of what they say doesn’t even apply to our lives anymore. But I guess their supporters are in majority and since the world is hit by the worst democratic fever ever we have no choice but to accept what they say">Humour off beat News</a>

I used to observe the world around me and saw that everybody was busy doing something. Then I realized that there must be something I can do well but the real issue is identifying what it is that you are good at. Once you hit the spot within yourself then you must do all you can to polish your skills and present yourself in the appropriate job. Remember you are not asking the employer for a favor rather you are offering them your service for which you should be paid. If you have the skills and lack the confidence there are chances that you won’t get the job. On the other hand if you have the right confidence then you can get a job even with limited skill provided that you are willing to learn">Jobs</a>

It is no secret that the cost of rendering the services of a reputable lawyer to fight your case can be quite high and may not even make your case worth fighting for. This is because most good lawyers work in the biggest firms, which charge a lot. To counter this trend law firms have started operating with a small set up but the same quality services that you would get in the more established law firms. This enables them to reduce their charges as their overhead charges are minimal compared to the huge agencies">Legal</a>

Most of the decent and reliable news channels that you see on the TV also operate on the Internet. The Internet however gives you an added benefit of searching for your particular news item of concern. This comes in very handy because on the TV you would be bound to the telecasting schedule of the news channel. For example if you were looking for the weather news you would have to wait until the TV showed that segment whereas you can go straight at it on the Internet">News</a>

I mean who could’ve thought of taming an elephant for personal use. When you consider the size difference and the brute strength of the various creatures that man has managed to tame it comes across as nothing short of a miracle. From buffaloes for tilling the land, camels for riding and dolphins for giving exuberant water shows man has managed to develop quite a few relationships with the animal worlds.

Jobless youth, effortless labor and worthless conduct mark our society. Our relationships are loveless and attitude careless with feelings that are heartless. Our shameless politics and brainless bosses have made us sick of authority. It all comes down to the fact that the education we get out of our system is void of any value whatsoever. In my school of thought an M.B.A student who does not have the decency to throw the garbage in the dustbin and would rather litter the ground he walks on is a failure">Reference and Education</a>

For centuries man has been trying to explore the mysteries of nature. Over time man has realized that many things in nature have been made subservient to him. Man benefits from the sun that gives him warmth. Had it been any closer it would have burnt all that is on the Earth. Similarly the rain that falls from the sky helps the crops to grow. The crops of varied colors and tastes are themselves miracles of nature that man benefits from. What force is there that regulates the affairs of the universe and who is it that sustains and protects all that exists. Much to the disgust of the atheist we have modern scientific knowledge also attesting to the fact that the there is indeed a creator, sustainer and protector with a conscious will behind the functioning of the universe">Science</a>

This is still true to a very great extent especially in the more rural areas in the world but the effect of the intermingling that has taken place as a result of the improvements in means of mass communication can also be seen. The result has been cultures crossing boundaries and merging into alien cultures to form something completely new.

This is why the tourism industry has been blossoming ever since the improvements in modes of transport. The most beneficial and virtuous kind of traveling however is the one that is done with the intention of seeking knowledge. Knowledge itself can be divided into two categories; one that is beneficial and one that is not. For example knowing the history of the world without learning lessons from it is not valuable. Whereas traveling to seek just a word of wisdom from the people of true knowledge is not only beneficial in practical terms it is spiritually uplifting as well">Travel and Leisure</a>
