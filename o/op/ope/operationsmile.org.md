### NOTE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN

Operation Smile is concerned about the protection of online privacy for all our website users. We are particularly respectful of the privacy of our young users. We encourage parents to monitor their children's use of the Internet and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without permission. We will never attempt to extract unnecessary information from our users, regardless of age.

### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

Like most website owners, Operation Smile receives and records information from your browser in our website server logs, including your IP or referral address and the page you requested. Aside from this standard tracking data, the only other personal information our site collects about you is such data as you knowingly provide in one of our on-line forms. Operation Smile is the sole owner of any information collected on this site. This information is used solely for our own statistical and donor relation purposes. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We will only release personal information to another person or company with your consent, or to the extent required by law. 

Keeping this personal information secure is a top priority for Operation Smile. Personal information is private and confidential; accordingly, the information provided is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated employees, trained in the proper handling of customer information, and is used only for the purpose for which the information is collected. Whenever Operation Smile should hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and allow us to audit them for compliance.

#### Credit Card Information Security

We care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use high grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. Companies we work with to process credit card transactions also use high grade encryption and security protocols. Contributions may also be made by calling 1-888-OPSMILE (1- 888-677-6453). 

#### Personal Information Security

In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls over information you share with us, Operation Smile works to accurately process your contribution and volunteer information. Operation Smile employs error checking procedures to make certain transactions are processed completely and accurately. As necessary, changes are made to improve our systems. And, independent external and internal audits are conducted to ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site. During business hours, staff is available to answer questions about your financial donation or personal information at 1-888-OPSMILE (1- 888-677-6453).

#### Email Privacy

We are committed to keeping your email address confidential. Operation Smile complies fully with the federal [CAN-SPAM Act of 2003](http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). We will not share, sell, rent, lease, swap or authorize any third party to use your email address for any purpose without your permission. We will use your email address solely to communicate information related to Operation Smile and will maintain any information you send via email to us in accordance with applicable federal law.

If you received an email from us, your email address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving email communications from us, or you have donated to us, purchased from us or otherwise have an existing relationship with us.

We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our emails. However, you may modify your email preferences at any time. Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to change your expressed interests, or to cease receiving email from us altogether. If you would like to modify your preferences, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email you receive from us.

#### Communications Preferences

We strive for accurate, respectful and relevant communications with our donors. We occasionally exchange mailing addresses with select non-profit groups. We will not sell, rent or share your email address or telephone number. If you would like to correct or update your personal information, modify your mailing preferences, or if you do not wish to participate in mailing address exchange activities, please call 1-888-OPSMILE (1-888-667-6453) or email [drelations@operationsmile.org](mailto:drelations@operationsmile.org). A gift made through this appeal represents a gift to the entire Operation Smile mission. To help the most children, we use your gift where it can do the most good by pooling it with the gifts of others.
