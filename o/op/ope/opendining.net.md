We may update this policy to reflect changes to our privacy practices, or for other operational or legal reasons.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will give you notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on this Website, and where appropriate, by other means.  By continuing to use this Website, Open Dining system services, or our Support Services after changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.

## Collection of Information

We collect names, phone numbers, postal/delivery addresses, email addresses, payment information, and special ordering instructions, during the ordering processes and account registration / access.

We collect data about the Open Dining services that you visit and utilize, including orders in progress and abandoned orders.  We collect data about how and when you access your account and the Open Dining system, such as IP addresses, the device and browser you use, your network connection, your location (as provided by your device, with consent), and information about how you navigate and use the Services.

We use this information to give you access to and improve our Services, including processing orders. We also use this information to personalize the Services for you, and we may use this information to provide you with advertising or marketing.  Finally, this information is used for fraud and risk monitoring, to detect fraudulent activity within the Services and provide honest customers with a good experience.

If you are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), you have certain rights with respect to your personal data. If you are a merchant, a partner, or a customer of Open Dining's Services and wish to exercise these rights, please reach out to us using the contact information below. If you are a customer of a merchant who uses Open Dining's services and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the merchants you interacted with directly, as we serve as a processor on their behalf, and can only forward your request to them to allow them to respond.

Additionally, if you are located in the EEA, we are generally processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you, such as an order through the Services for a merchant restaurant, or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above, unless we are required by law to obtain your consent for a particular processing operation. Specifically. we process your personal data to pursue the following legitimate interests, either for ourselves, our merchants, our partners, or other third parties (including our merchants’ customers):

  * To prevent risk and fraud on our platform;
  * To provide communications, marketing, and advertising;
  * To provide reporting and analytics;
  * To help merchants find and integrate with apps through our app store;
  * To provide troubleshooting, support services, or to answer questions;
  * To test out features or additional services; and
  * To improve our services, applications, and websites.



When we process personal information to pursue these legitimate interests, we do so where we believe the nature of the processing, the information being processed, and the technical and organizational measures employed to protect that information can help mitigate the risks to the data subject.
