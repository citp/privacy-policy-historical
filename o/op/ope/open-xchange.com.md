# Privacy Policy | open-xchange.com

(Last Updated: January 2007)

Open-Xchange is committed to protecting your privacy. Please read the Open-Xchange Privacy Policy below.

This Open-Xchange Privacy Policy applies to data collected by Open-Xchange through the majority of its Web sites and services. It does not apply to those Open-Xchange sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own Privacy Policy.

**Collection of Your Personal Information**  
In order to access some Open-Xchange services, you will be asked to sign in with an email address and/or password, which we refer to as your credentials.

As part of creating your credentials, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password.

At some Open-Xchange sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your email address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, preferences and favorites.

We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with Open-Xchange sites. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.  
When you receive newsletters or promotional email from Open-Xchange, we may use customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information.

**Use of Your Personal Information**  
Open-Xchange collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and to carry out the transactions you have requested.

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters and technical service issues. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Open-Xchange and its affiliates.

Personal information collected on Open-Xchange sites may be stored and processed in the European Union, United States or any other country in which Open-Xchange or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. 

**Sharing of Your Personal Information**  
Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Open-Xchange and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent.

Some Open-Xchange services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Open-Xchange and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.

We hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites or processing transactions. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (I) comply with the law or legal process served on Open-Xchange; (II) protect and defend the rights or property of Open-Xchange (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (III) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Open-Xchange services or members of the public.

**Communication Preferences**  
You can stop the delivery of future promotional email and Newsletter from Open-Xchange by following the specific instructions in the email you receive.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Open-Xchange will use your personal information, we will notify you by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change.
