# Privacy Policy

We guarantee your privacy and on-line shopping safety.

We do not store any credit card information. All billing information is processed by the payment processer (Bank or PayPal.com). Paypal is an online bank owned by eBay and considered trustworthy today. PayPal is secured by multiple industrial security technologies including solutions from VeriSign.

We may occasionally send out email promotions and newsletters to our customers. These e-mail are sent very sparingly (approximately 1 per month). You can opt-in and opt-out at any time by checking the newsletter checkbox in your account settings.

We will never share your personal and private information with anyone, and any personal information collected by us is only used to properly process and deliver your order.
