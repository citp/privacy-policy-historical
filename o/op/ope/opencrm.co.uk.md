### Statistics Collected as You Browse Our Web Site

As you browse the site, our Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

* How many people visit our Web site.  
* Which pages people visit on our Web site.  
* From which domains our visitors come (e.g. "google.co.uk", "aol.com").  
* Which browsers people use to visit our Web site.

### Organisational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us

Within our Web site, you may be asked to give us personal or organisational information in order to receive information about a product or service. This information may range from your postcode to a specific phone number, email address, mailing address, organisation URL, product serial numbers and control codes, account number or credit card number.

### Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

### Your IP Address and Host Name

Our Web site logs Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analysed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content.

### Registration Forms

We encourage all visitors to register on our Web site, though registration is only required to access premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications, please contact us.

### Order Forms

Our order forms securely collect contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfilment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfil your order. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product.

During the purchasing process, additional information may be added to your profile to make it easier for you to purchase products/services from us in the future. This may include order history and billing information. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing your profile or cancelling an on-line account.
