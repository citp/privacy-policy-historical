### Third Party Service Providers working on our behalf:

We may pass your information to our third party service providers, agents subcontractors and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf. However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes. Please be reassured that we will not release your information to third parties beyond the Ac6 Network for them to use for their own direct marketing purposes, unless you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.

We work closely with various third party service or product providers to bring you a range of quality and reliable products and services designed to meet the needs of the Embedded Systems designers and manufacturers. When you enquire about or purchase one or more of these products or services, the relevant third party product or service provider will use your details to provide you with information and carry out their obligations arising from any contracts you have entered into with them. In some cases, they will be acting as a data controller of your information and therefore we advise you to read their Privacy Policy.

## How you can access and update your information

The accuracy of your information is important to us. You can access all information retained about you by editing your profile on the OpenSTM32.org website. 

Should you want to delete this information, just delete your account on OpenSTM32.org and this will automatically delete all personal information we retain about you. Note however that posts you have done on the OpenSTM32 forums will still be available and labeled by the pseudo (login name) you have used when creating your account, so you should not use a sensible information for this. 

## Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information

When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely. However we do not retain sensitive information so all information is currently saved and displayed in clear form, at the exception of your password for which we only store a secure hash allowing to verify your password but not to retrieve it. 

Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are transmitted normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 

## Profiling

We may analyse your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information relevant to you. We may make use of additional information about you when it is available from external sources to help us do this effectively. 

We may also use your personal information to detect and reduce the risk of abuse of our web site facilities (spamming the forums for example). In case we detect such abuse we reserve the right to immediately close your account; However in this case we may retain some personal information (like your email or IP address) to help us prevent further such attempts of abusing uour website facilities.

## Links to other websites

By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If we transfer your information outside of the EU in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Policy.
