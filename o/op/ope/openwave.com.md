# Openwave Privacy Policy | Openwave

This Privacy Policy statement describes our practices regarding how personal information we collect on the Openwave Systems Inc. ("Openwave") website ([www.openwave.com](http://www.openwave.com/ "www.openwave.com")) is used and shared with third parties. By visiting the Openwave website or otherwise submitting your personal information to us, you accept the practices described in this statement. The information that we receive through our web site depends on what you do during your visit, and what service(s) you request. 

## European Union Users

YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO OPENWAVE'S PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY OPENWAVE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AND IN THE UNITED STATES. UNITED STATES LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. 

IF YOU REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION, YOU WILL ENSURE THAT EACH MEMBER OF YOUR ORGANIZATION (INCLUDING EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS) ABOUT WHOM PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROVIDED TO OPENWAVE HAS GIVEN HIS OR HER EXPRESS CONSENT TO OPENWAVE'S PROCESSING OF SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION.

Please see the [Safe Harbor Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/safe_harbor_privacy_policy.html) in addition to this Privacy Policy. 

## Personal Information

We may ask you to submit personal information at various places on our web site, including on pages for requesting a service or information such as a white paper, subscribing to a newsletter, submitting feedback, or participating in a forum or survey. This personal information, which you voluntarily submit, include your name, address, email address and telephone number, as well as other information about, for example, your interest in Openwave products and services, your employer, and your employment position. 

We use this personal information to contact you or send you information you have requested or that we feel will be of interest to you. We may contact you via phone, email, or postal mail. We generally provide an option for you to choose not to receive these types of communications. If we send you a promotional or marketing based email, we will include an option to unsubscribe in the footer of the email. However, even if you request not to be contacted by us, we reserve the right to use your contact information if we consider it necessary to send you crucial information about, for example, the product or services you have purchased from us or information about changes to our privacy policy.

## Non-Personally Identifying Information

We may also collect information automatically about the use of our web site, through, for example, "cookies" or "IP addresses." This information is not collected and stored in a personally identifiable manner, however. This information helps us evaluate and improve our site and is also used for marketing and investment analysis. Additionally, third parties place cookies and other tracking technologies on our website, but only in aggregate statistical form that includes no personal information.

"Cookies" are small files web sites place on your hard drive that allow sites to identify you. The use of cookies is a common practice on many web sites. For example, if you allow a site to remember your login name or password, the site places a cookie on your computer. Cookies cannot read any other information on your hard drive. We may place cookies on your computer to allow us to identify you. We may use cookies to measure web site traffic, to offer you certain services, or to customize your visit. However, if you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your browser may permit you to do so. An "IP address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address may vary from session to session.

## Use of Contractors and Service Providers

Openwave uses third parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of its operations, which may require disclosure of your personal information to them. For example, Openwave may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or regular mail) about our products or services, to send information to you through an email service provider, to host our website and related databases, to collect your job application on our website, and to perform other work that we may need to outsource. Openwave requires these third parties to use your personal information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform. 

## Public Forums

If you use a blog, developer forum or other public forum on this website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

## Corporate Family

We may share some or all of your personal information with any current or future "affiliate" (which means a parent company, a subsidiary, joint venture, or other company under a common control with Openwave), in which case we will require the affiliate to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires Openwave (or a business unit of Openwave that uses your personal information), that company will possess the personal information collected by Openwave and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this privacy policy. We will notify you of these changes as described below in “Changes to the Privacy Policy.”

## Security

We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, you should know that no company, including Openwave, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.

Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, however, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to other third parties. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served to us. Additionally, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. 

## Linked Sites

Our site may link to other websites and widgets not controlled by Openwave. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any other websites. We therefore encourage you to read the privacy policies on those other websites. These widgets may have a feature where your email is collected to send information to another third party. Please refer to their privacy policy when you enter your personal information.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
