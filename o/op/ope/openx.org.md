2\. Information We Collect.

(a) Personal Information. We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, username, email address, credit card details, and such other information as we may from time to time request (“Personal Information”) only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, you may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information when you register with the OpenX Website, when you download and register OpenX Software and at other times. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or services available on or through the OpenX Website.

(b) Non-Personal Information. We automatically collect anonymous usage information that does not identify an individual user (“Non-Personal Information”) to help us understand how users use the OpenX Website. For example, each time you use the OpenX Website we automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the OpenX Website.

(c) Cookies and Web Beacons. We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser) and Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage). We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the OpenX Website. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the OpenX Website may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Service Providers (described below) may use cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.

Non-Personal Information and Personal Information may be combined with data collected from other sources so that we may further improve the relevance of products, services, and advertisements offered on or through the OpenX Website. We will not sell, share or rent Personal Information to third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose Personal Information to third parties, without your express permission or as expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

(b) Service Providers. From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (“Service Providers”). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as credit card processing, advertising, analytics tools, widget providers, DNS providers, data management services, Web hosting, and Web development. We provide our Service Providers with only the information necessary for them to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information for purposes other than as specified by OpenX.

(c) Standard Analytics Information. We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Non-Personal Information regarding the OpenX Website (e.g., number of visits, page views, number of registered members who reside in a particular geographic location, etc.). However, such information does not identify you individually.

(e) Other. In certain instances we may disclose Non-Personal Information or Personal Information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect OpenX or our users or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure.

5\. Public Forums.

Please be advised that, whenever you voluntarily post information to any OpenX community page or any other public forums, such information can and may be accessed by the public. This means that any person or entity with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.

6\. Security.

Information that we collect is stored on servers that OpenX solely manages, using standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information in an effort to protect information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
