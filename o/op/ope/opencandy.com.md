When utilizing third party sites or software products, you should read the relevant privacy policies of those third parties for information regarding their privacy practices.

### 1\. SUMMARY OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY

SweetLabs maintains or provides multiple sites, products and services. To better explain what information We collect, and how We use the information We collect, We have broken out our Privacy Policy into the following sections:

### 2\. WHAT WE COLLECT AND WHY

**a. USERS RECEIVING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OPENCANDY SOFTWARE NETWORK**

**If you are a user receiving recommendations through the OpenCandy Software Recommendation Network, We collect the following types of information:**

When you install third party software that has chosen to use the OpenCandy Software Recommendation Network, as part of the installation process a temporary file transmits anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your computer system, such as the geo-location, time zone, language setting, software installed on your system including the operating system and default browser, as well as information regarding whether recommended software has been accepted, downloaded, and installed. Much of the non-personally identifiable information We collect is similar to the types of information that websites often collect through a browser. 

We utilize this information to ensure compatibility of recommended software with your computer system, and to help us improve our ability to provide consumers the best product recommendations available. It is also SweetLabs’ policy to require our publisher partners to provide their customers (who receive recommendations from the OpenCandy Software Network) notice of SweetLabs’ end user license terms, including a link to our Privacy Policy.

Please see our FAQs for [detailed information about how the recommendation process works.](http://www.opencandy.com/faqs/network-sdk-faqs/)
