                <p>
                Cloudnine Weather LLC ("Cloudnine Weather", "we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and strives to earn and keep your trust.

                </p>
                <p>
                Questions regarding this policy and our practice should be directed to Cloudnine Weather, by email to hello@opensnow.com or hello@opensummit.com, or by postal mail to Cloudnine Weather, PO Box 1143, Boulder, CO 80306.

                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>


                <p>
                This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use ("Terms"). It tells you what information we collect, how we protect it and what choices you have about how that information is used. Most information collected is to enable us to best meet the needs of our users, as sports participants, in a highly customized and responsive manner, however we may also use collected information for business reasons, such as analytics, evaluation of the Services, improvement of the Services, and other uses set forth herein.
                </p>
                <p>
                Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning provided for such terms in the Terms.
                </p>
                <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>


                <p>
                Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Cloudnine Weather does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Cloudnine Weather learns that personal information of persons under 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Services, Cloudnine Weather will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a registered user or subscriber of Cloudnine Weather or any of the Services or otherwise set up an Account, then please contact Cloudnine Weather at hello@opensnow.com or hello@opensummit.com to have that child's account terminated and personal information deleted.
                </p>
                <h3>Public Forum Discussions and Comments</h3>

All such information may be disclosed, used, or reproduced by Cloudnine Weather in accordance with our Terms.
                </p>
                <h3>SECTION 1 - PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

                <p>
                The information we collect will vary based on your use of the Services and information, actions you elect to take, and based on such actions the information and data you elect to submit (for example, if you elect to create an Account certain information will be requested, some of which is required to create the Account and some of which is optional).

Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge for this information.
                </p>

                <p>
                We use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of personal information that you share with us. However, no data transmission over the internet (or, with respect to our mobile services, over cellular phone networks) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

                </p>
                <p>
                Except as set forth herein, we restrict access to your personal information such that those Cloudnine Weather employees, contractors, and agents who need to know such personal information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we will have no obligation for the security, privacy, or confidentiality of any information which:

                </p>
                <p>
                We have no obligation with respect to any User Content you submit, including without limitation user comments, photographs, videos, and other media, and all such User Content will be shared or publicly available in accordance with the functionality of the Services.

                <h3>California Residents -- Your California Privacy Rights</h3>


                <p>
                California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.
                </p>
                <p>
                As discussed above in Your Privacy Choices, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your personal Information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact Cloudnine Weather as described above.

                <p>
                To enhance your online experience, we use "cookies" or similar technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences.

                <p>
                We use cookies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize Cloudnine Weather content, offerings or advertisements. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience with Cloudnine Weather (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use products on our sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising on Cloudnine Weather or other websites you visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by Cloudnine Weather. This also helps us, our service providers, and partners provide more relevant advertising.

                </p>
                <p>
                We, our third party service providers, advertiser or our partners may also use "web beacons" (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins. Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.
                </p>
                <p>
                You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.

                <h3>SECTION 6 - COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES, AD SERVERS, SPONSORS</h3>


                <p>
                Some of our Services contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

                <p>
                Cloudnine Weather Services covered by this privacy statement sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The site will notify you (in its privacy policy or elsewhere) at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.
                </p>
                <p>
                We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting and web analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant content, marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement. We will have no obligation or responsibility with respect to any information collected by a third party.
