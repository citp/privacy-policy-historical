### Privacy Policy

The following Privacy Policy is applicable to all of the information collected during your use of opensourceCMS.com. Please read this information carefully before accessing any part of the site. 

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**  
OpensourceCMS.com recognizes and respects the privacy of users of its web site. To better protect your privacy, we are providing this Policy to explain our online information practices and the way that we may collect and use information from you.   
OpensourceCMS.com will not sell, lease, or rent its mailing list to third parties.  
OpensourceCMS.com will not use or share the personally-identifiable information provided to us online without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit unrelated uses. 

**The Information We Collect**  
Generally, OpensourceCMS.com may gather information about visitors to its web site when it aggregates information gathered by tracking the usage of certain features available on the web site. The collection of this information enables OpensourceCMS.com to tailor its content to your needs, keep you informed of information that you may find of interest, and to help better understand the demographics of its audience, which assists it in providing appropriate products and services to its customers. 

**Registration or Information Requests**  
Additionally, at certain sections of our web sites you may register or request to receive additional information or services. During these processes, you may be asked to provide the following personally-identifiable information: your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address. OpensourceCMS.com and/or its designee will use this information in responding to your request.   
When you register, you may also be given the opportunity to ask to be on OpensourceCMS.com's mailing list for future information. If you decide to be on our mailing list, OpensourceCMS.com will maintain your personally-identifiable information in secure on-line and off-line facilities. Your personally-identifiable information will only be disclosed to certain employees of OpensourceCMS.com or its designees with a business purpose to review your information. Except as set forth in this Policy, if you decide not to be on our mailing list or are not given the option to opt-in or out of the mailing list, OpensourceCMS.com will not maintain your personally-identifiable information for longer than is reasonably necessary to respond to your request and maintain its computer systems, except that OpensourceCMS.com may utilize your personal information in aggregated statistics.

 **Electronic Mail Messages**  
We will use return email addresses to answer, or have our designees answer electronic mail messages that we may receive. Unless you specifically request that we not keep your address and/or other information for our mailing list, we reserve the right to keep and disclose your address and other information as if you registered to be on our mailing list. 

**Data Security**  
OpensourceCMS.com uses industry standard efforts to safeguard your personally-identifiable information. However, it is impossible to absolutely guarantee the security of data transmission over the internet or any wireless network. Therefore, although we take reasonable measures to protect your information, OpensourceCMS.com cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or from online services and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will use industry standard efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

 **Other Disclosures**  
Finally, OpensourceCMS.com may store and disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the rights, safety or property of OpensourceCMS.com or others and (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements.

 **Correcting Your Information**  
If your personally-identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer want OpensourceCMS.com to maintain your information, this can be accomplished by sending us an email at admin @ opensourcecms.com.

 **Cookies and Log Files**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. OpensourceCMS.com may use cookies on its sites to provide better navigation on our site for you. Additionally, you may still use our site even if you reject the cookie. Cookies, however, may be used by some of the web sites to which we link. In addition, we may use your Internet Protocol (or IP) address to analyze trends, administer the site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order to improve our site. We will not link any IP addresses that we may collect to any personally-identifiable information. 

**Links**  
OpensourceCMS.com endeavors to only link to reputable organizations related to your areas of interest. Because these other sites may not be hosted or controlled by OpensourceCMS.com, however, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. Therefore, the privacy policies with respect to these areas may differ from those applicable to our site and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of each of those other web sites. This privacy policy only applies to information collected and maintained by OpensourceCMS.com. 

**Governing Law**  
The internal laws of the State of Virginia, without reference to any choice of law provisions, shall govern any claims relating to the materials on our web sites.
