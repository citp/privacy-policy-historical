<p>We (OpenCandy, Inc.) know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. By visiting our website at http://www.OpenCandy.com (”OpenCandy.com”), or using any of our services or products, including the OpenCandy recommendation network, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (”Personal Information”) and other information we gather when you are accessing OpenCandy.com or when you use our services. This policy does not apply to (and we are not responsible for) the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to individuals we do not employ or manage. When utilizing third party sites or software products, you should read the relevant privacy policies of those providers for information regarding their privacy practices.</p>
<p><strong>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY:</strong></p>
<p>Website Visitors</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> When you visit our site we will send your browser a cookie which is stored in your browser and allows us to uniquely identify it. We use cookies to help us better understand our users and our product which allows us to improve our service. This data may include storing user preferences and product utilization information such as number of visitors, average time spent on pages, features used, and other information which helps us determine which features are most important to you and working effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Logs.</strong> When you visit our site we capture and store the data that your browser sends us. This data may include your browser type, language, Internet Protocol address, the date and time of your request and the cookie that helps us identify your unique browser.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. We only use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of our site or services so that we can improve our services performance</p>
<p><strong>Communication.</strong> Anytime you send us a communication we may keep this communication so that we can respond to your requests or inquiries and help improve our services to you.</p>
<p><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> We also receive and store any information you enter on our site or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, user name and email address. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as improving the content of our site, customizing and improving our services, and communicating with you about specials and new features</p>
<p><strong>Developers and Publishers on the OpenCandy Network</strong></p>
<p>If you are a software developer or publisher utilizing the OpenCandy Network, we also collect the following types of information:</p>
<p>Account Information. We collect and maintain all information that you provide to us in connection with the account registration process in order to help us manage your account and communicate with you regarding our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics Information.</strong> In connection with the installation of publisher software that includes a recommendation from the OpenCandy Network, we collect certain types of statistical and analytics information through our software plug-in regarding the publishers end users (as described in the next paragraph) and the performance of recommendations and our overall service, in order to help us optimize that performance.</p>
<p><strong><a name="recommendation-privacy"></a>Consumers Receiving Product Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>With respect to consumers receiving recommendations through the OpenCandy Network, we collect information through our software plug-in that is needed to provide relevant recommendations as well as information that helps us understand whether or not our service made a good recommendation. This information is not personally identifiable and may include information regarding your geo-location, operating system, language setting and aggregate statistics that tell us whether or not you already have a product installed that we might recommend to you, as well as information regarding whether a recommendation has been accepted, downloaded, and installed. We utilize this information to help us improve our ability to provide consumers the best product recommendations available. It is also OpenCandys policy to generally require our publisher partners to provide their customers (who receive OpenCandy Network recommendations) notice of OpenCandys privacy practices in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agents.</strong> We may share your Personal Information with third party agents for the purpose of approving and enabling your participation in our recommendation network. For example, processing and approving your payments, email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

<p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If OpenCandy or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that OpenCandy goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. Accordingly, we may transfer or assign all the information we have collected as part of a merger, acquisition, sale or other change of control. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror may continue to use your Personal Information and other information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information.</strong> We may share your non-personally identifiable information with partners and other third parties for the purpose of helping us improve our recommendations and the overall performance of our service. For example, utilizing data to determine the probability that a consumer will enjoy a specific product.</p>
