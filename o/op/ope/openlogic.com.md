# Privacy Policy | Rogue Wave

Rogue Wave Privacy Policy covers the collection, use and disclosure of information that may be collected by Rogue Wave whenever you interact with Rogue Wave, e.g., when you visit our websites, when you purchase Rogue Wave products or services, or when you call our sales or support associates (collectively, the "Service"). Please regularly review our Privacy Policy.

### Notice and Disclosure

In general, you can visit this website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. There are times, however, when we may gather information from you. We will not collect any personal information that you do not volunteer. We are the sole owner of all information on our websites.

We will not sell, share, or rent personal information to others. We may periodically send you email about new products and services, industry issues or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such emails, simply click the "unsubscribe" link in any email you receive from us. We also have a preference center to indicate your areas of interest and to control our outreach to you.

To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Rogue Wave group globally who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with this privacy policy.

There may also be times when it may be advantageous for Rogue Wave to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Rogue Wave has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Rogue Wave to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with Rogue Wave policies.

We will, at our discretion, disclose information if we believe that we are required to do so by law, that such disclosure is necessary to protect us from legal liability or that we should do so to protect the integrity of the Service.

### Information Gathering

Our web servers automatically recognize and collect the domain name and IP address of visitors to our website. In addition, we collect aggregate information on web page visits.

A cookie is a small amount of data transferred to your browser and read by the web server that placed it there. It works as a sort of identification card, recording your preferences and previously entered information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to accept or reject it.

### Your Personal Information
