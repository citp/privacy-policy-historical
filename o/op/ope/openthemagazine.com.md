We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Open under confidentiality agreements.

However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Open terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

We transfer information about you if Open is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Open will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
