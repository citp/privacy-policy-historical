# Privacy Policy | Op4G : Opinions 4 Good

Effective Date: 10/01/2013

This privacy policy applies to [op4g.com](http://www.op4g.com/) owned and operated by Op4G. This privacy policy describes how Op4G collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web sites: [op4g.com](http://www.op4g.com/) and [myop4g.com](http://www.myop4g.com/).  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

Op4G has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program, viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the Web sites and subdomains at [op4g.com](http://www.op4g.com/) and [myop4g.com](http://www.myop4g.com/).

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that Op4G have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe [here](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

Security is the key to our shared success. Each element of Op4G is designed to fiercely protect our Members’ privacy and information. We make no distinction between “personal” and “non-personal” information — we protect both equally. And we are 100% transparent with our Members about our policies, their data, and how to safely leave our programs.

Any information conveyed to our Clients is on an anonymous basis, unless specifically approved by a Member through a proactive, opt-in choice.

### Information Sharing

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as sending you newsletters. These companies are authorized to use your personal information _only as necessary to provide_ these services to us.

We may also disclose your personal information:

  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so



### Secure Databases

Op4G stores personal and survey data in two physically separate server environments. Our data architecture is designed to never allow any Client or third party access to individual member data, or to correlate any data that might identify a participant.

When you enter sensitive information (such as health information) on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Member Usernames

Members are assigned a non-traceable unique Op4G username that allows only Op4G to certify the authenticity of information we send to our Clients. Our system is built to prevent the revealing of any individual identity.

### User Access and Choice

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or amend it by making the change on your account information page or by emailing us at support@op4g.com.  We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

### One-Click Account Termination

Want to leave Op4G? A single step of clicking ‘Delete My Account’ on your Account Profile will remove all personal, demographic, and member information from our databases (except for information required by law).

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Opt-In Control

Members have total control over what information they receive from Non-Profits. When offered an opportunity to participate in a specific survey opportunity, Members always opt-in and will never be forced to answer or reveal information. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. The requested information typically includes information (such as name, age, gender, preferences) and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to __ provide insights into client funded studies associated with a variety of topics.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at support@op4g.com.

### Cookies and other Tracking Technologies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We [do/do not] link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  Session cookies enable Op4G to track your progress specific to studies you elect to participate in.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable Op4G to mark your progress in a specific study, should you decide to leave the study and return at a later time to finish.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

The use of cookies by our tracking service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our tracking service providers use both session ID and persistent cookies to provide accurate crediting of your survey taking efforts.

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personal information.

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.  [IP addresses are tied to personal information to prevent a single user from attempting to acquire multiple Op4G accounts _._
