## 13\. Cookies

 **What are cookies?**

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are sent to your browser and stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device when you visit a website. The cookies send information back to the originating website or another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies can be permanent (these are known as persistent cookies) where they remain on your computer until you delete them, or temporary (these are known as session cookies) where they last only until you close your browser. Cookies can also be first-party cookies which are set by the website which is being visited, or third-party cookies which are set by a website other than the one being visited.

 **What cookies do we use?**

 **Service functionality cookies.** We use these cookies for providing the full functionality of the Services, such as a “login & registration” cookie that saves your login credentials in protected areas to save the need to login to the Website on each visit, and a “block repeat voting” cookie that saves your vote in the cookie to block multiple voting. These cookies are first-party cookies, and can be either permanent or temporary. Without these cookies the Website and the Services won't work properly or won't be able to provide certain features and functionalities.

 **Advertising cookies.** These cookies can be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help manage the delivery of advertising campaigns. Advertising cookies are also used to customize the advertising across the Website and make it more relevant to you. Advertising cookies are placed by third parties such as advertisers, ad platforms and their agents, and can be permanent or temporary cookies. In short, they are related to advertising services provided by third parties on the Website.

 **Third-party cookies.** On some pages of the Website, we may have content from third-party services, such as YouTube or Facebook. Please note that we do not control any cookies which are used by these services and you should check the relevant third-party website for more information about these.

Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the Services and enjoying the full features of the Website.

## 14\. Google Analytics

The Website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics is used to analyze how the Services are used, diagnose service or technical problems and monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns. Google Analytics also uses cookies and the information generated by the cookie regarding your use of the Website (including your IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the U.S. and stored. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity, and providing other services relating to Website activity and Internet usage. Google may also pass this information on to third parties in so far as this is required by law or if third parties process the data on Google’s behalf. Google will not under any circumstances associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of the Website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the Website (including your IP address) being passed to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de>.

## 15\. Third party advertisements

We may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. We do not provide any personal data to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information. We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit the Website. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personal data (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
