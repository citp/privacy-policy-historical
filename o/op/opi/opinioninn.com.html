                  <h1>OpinionInn Privacy Policy</h1>              
                    <p>
                        OpinionInn is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. OpinionInn is a branded site owned and operated by Orchid Online Research Pvt Ltd.
                        Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website and services. By using this website and registering to our service you agree that your personal information will be shared with Orchid Online Research Pvt Ltd where a lower level of privacy protection may apply than in your own country. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website and services. By using this website and registering to our service you agree that your personal information will be shared with Orchid Online Research Pvt Ltd where a lower level of privacy protection may apply than in your own country. </p>
                    <p>As you can see by this example, SimpleModal can be easily configured to behave like an OSX dialog. With a handful options, 2 custom callbacks and some styling, you have a visually appealing dialog that is ready to use!</p>
                    <h3>What personally identifiable information does OpinionInn collect from me? </h3>
                    <p>OpinionInn collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of websites.</p>
                    <p>
                        Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, OpinionInn asks for your name, email 
                            address, zip code, household information and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to OpinionInn and you can access the various protected areas of the site.

                            Who is collecting information and for what purpose? 
                            OpinionInn collects valuable information, which assists in developing new products and services. When you are on OpinionInn site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with OpinionInn or with any other third party with whom you elect to share such information, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than OpinionInn, the use of your data and personal information will be governed by appropriate confidentiality and security agreements between OpinionInn and such third parties.

                    <h5>With whom does OpinionInn share my information?</h5>
                    <p>
                        As a general rule, OpinionInn will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or User Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.
                            <br>
                        Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: OpinionInn may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. If any personal data about you were ever to be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give OpinionInn permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.
                            <br>
                        Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, OpinionInn may match user information with third party data. Also, OpinionInn discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
                            <br>
                        Other: OpinionInn may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating OpinionInn’s Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) OpinionInn’s rights or property, other OpinionInn users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. OpinionInn may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
                            <br>
                        Finally, if there is a sale of a majority of the shares or assets of the legal entities owning and operating OpinionInn, you agree that your personal information and data may be transferred or assigned to such new owners.
                            <br>
