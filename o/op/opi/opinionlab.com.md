We use this information to help ensure that our Site functions properly.

Some ways we use the usage data include operating, improving and personalizing the services and our offerings, as well as other Verint products and services.
  * IP Address: Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.

### **Third Party Advertising**

Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting. Our goal at Verint is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. We use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, as well as to assist with the delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.

Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across Verint’s websites.

For example, if you often visit content on the Verint network about Workforce Optimization (WFO), we or our service providers may use “web beacons” to infer your possible interest in WFO and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest when you are on the Site or on a third-party site. It’s important to understand that these technologies use anonymous identifiers within the “cookies” stored in your browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our [AdChoices page](https://www.verint.com/our-company/legal-documents/ad-choices/).

Verint adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance. To learn more about the Principles and your choices when it comes to the use of online behavioral advertising data by advertisers and ad servers across the Internet, visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ and <http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/> .
