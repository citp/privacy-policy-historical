## Data security

We have taken extensive technical and organisational measures to secure your data against potential risks, such as unauthorised login or access, unauthorised perusal, amendment or distribution, as well as against loss, deletion or misuse.

## Cookies

Cookies are small files that your browser stores on your PC in a directory designated specifically for this purpose. These cookies can be used e.g. to find out whether you have already visited a website. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. Nevertheless, you can change the settings in your browser, so that no cookies can be stored or so that your explicit agreement is required before any cookies are stored. You can also delete previously set cookies at any time. Please note that disabling cookies may result in your use of our website being restricted. 

We need cookies for the following purposes: 

### Web analysis

Like almost all website operators, we use analytical tools in the form of tracking software to ascertain the number of users using our website and how frequently they visit. 

To enable us to optimise our website and our service, we use Google Analytics, which is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses what are known as "cookies": these are text files stored on your computer and used to analyse your website usage. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymisation is enabled on this website, within member states of the European Union, or in other states that are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area Google first abbreviates your IP address. The full IP address will only be transmitted in exceptional circumstances to one of Google's servers in the USA, where it will then be abbreviated. Google will use this information on behalf of our website operator to analyse your use of the website in order to compile reports about website activities for the website operator and to perform other services connected with the use of the website and of the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged or combined with other data by Google. You can prevent cookies from being stored by applying the appropriate settings in your browser software; please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their full extent. 

You may also prevent Google from collecting data generated by the cookie referring to your website usage (including your IP address), and from processing these data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available from the following link tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de . As an alternative to the browser add-on or within browsers on mobile devices, please click on this link to prevent Google Analytics from collecting data in this website in future (the opt-out only works in this browser, and only for this domain). This stores an opt-out cookie on your device. If you delete your cookies in this browser, you need to click on this link again. Further information is available at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de or at www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html(general information on Google Analytics and data protection). 

This website uses Jetpack (formerly WordPress.com-Stats), a tool for statistically analysing visitor access, run by Automattic Inc. (132 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, CA, 94107, USA), using tracking technology from Quantcast Inc. (201 3rd St, Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103-3153, USA). Jetpack uses what are known as "cookies". These are text files stored on your computer that are used to analyse your website usage. The information on your use of this Internet service generated by the cookie is stored on a server in the USA. The IP address is anonymised immediately after processing and prior to being saved. You can prevent the installation of cookies by applying the appropriate settings in your browser software. Please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their full extent. You can opt out of Quantcast collecting and using your data in the future by setting an opt-out cookie on your browser. To do this, follow this link and click on "Click here to opt-out": www.quantcast.com/opt-out. If you delete all cookies on your computer, you will need to reinstall the opt-out cookie. 

## Google Fonts

This site uses web fonts provided by Google to uniformly display fonts. When you open a page, your browser loads the required Google Fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. 

To do this, your browser must connect to Google's servers. This gives Google knowledge that our website has been accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Fonts is in the interest of a consistent and user-friendly presentation of our website. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. 

If your browser does not support Google Fonts, your computer uses a standard font. Further information about Google Fonts can be found at <https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq> and in Google's privacy policy: <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/>

### Facebook

Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA and is available online at www.facebook.de . Individual social media plugins feature one of the Facebook logos or the extension 'Facebook Social Plugin'. A list of the visuals and functions of the individual plugins can be seen here: developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins. Whenever you visit a page on our website which contains one of these social media plugins, your browser will establish a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the social media plugins are transferred from Facebook to your browser, which incorporates them into the website. We therefore have no influence over the scope of the data which Facebook collects using its social media plugins, and are able to provide information to you about this only to the best of our knowledge: Because the social media plugin is embedded, Facebook is informed that you have visited the page of our website in question, even if you are not a registered user of Facebook or are not logged into Facebook at the time. This information is transferred from your browser along with your IP address to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there. According to information provided by Facebook, only an anonymised IP address is stored for non-registered users in Germany. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can directly attribute it to your Facebook account whenever you visit our website. Facebook receives information about your visit to our website, regardless of whether you interact with the social media plugins. If you interact with the social media plugins (for example, click the 'Like' button or leave a comment), the relevant information is transferred by your browser directly to Facebook and stored there. Additionally, the information is published on Facebook and displayed to your Facebook friends. To find out about the purpose and scope of this data gathering, further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as your rights and options for protecting your privacy, please review the Facebook privacy policy www.facebook.com/about/privacy . If you are a registered Facebook user, and prefer Facebook not to collect data about you via our website and connect it with your membership data stored at Facebook, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website.
