Survey Sampling International, LLC and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies (collectively “SSI”) provide sampling solutions and technology for survey research, providing clients with access to consumer and business-to-business respondents via internet, telephone (both fixed/landline and wireless/mobile), postal and multi-mode methodologies. SSI serves a vast array of for-profit and not-for profit businesses, universities and governmental agencies and departments. This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information (“PII”) and other information by SSI in connection with SSI’s Services (as defined herein). SSI’s Services provide you with the opportunity to join a Panel (as defined herein), participate in surveys (whether as a Panel member or a non-Panel member), use the websites associated with the Panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with Panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively “Services”). Registration with, use of, and access to SSI’s Services is subject to [SSI’s Terms and Conditions](http://opinionworld.com/en/policies/terms/general).  Your use of SSI’s Services is completely voluntary and therefore SSI’s processing of your PII in connection with the Services and this Privacy Policy is with your consent. SSI strives to conform its privacy practices to applicable laws, codes, and regulations, and the codes of standards of applicable market and opinion survey research associations, including, without limitation, CASRO and ESOMAR. For clarification, except for Panels that have a separate privacy policy, this Privacy Policy applies to all of SSI’s survey research panels, including, without limitation, SurveySpot, Opinion Outpost, OpinionWorld, Choozz and YourVoice (each a “Panel” and collectively the “Panels”). All references in this Privacy Policy to SSI include SSI and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. All references to “us” or “we” refer to SSI. 

All PII is stored on servers located in the United States, which servers are owned and maintained by SSI. SSI complies with the United States (“US”) - European Union (“EU”) and US – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from EU member countries and Switzerland. SSI has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.

User Content should only include audio, video, images, or the likeness of the individual submitting the User Content and should not contain copyrighted or trademarked content or material of any third party. User Content should not include audio, video, images, or the likeness of anyone other than the user and should not contain any PII of or about anyone other than the user.

## 2. **Information Collected Through Automated Means.** ****

SSI may also collect certain information automatically, such as information about: (i) your device or computer and its capabilities, including, without limitation, the operating system, the applications or programs on your device or computer, IP address, device carrier, device type, time zone, network status, browser type, browser identifier, unique device identification number, carrier user ID (a number uniquely allocated to you by your network provider), media access control address, international mobile equipment identity, locale and other information that alone or in combination may be used to uniquely identify your device or computer; and (ii) your activities in connection with SSI’s Services, including, without limitation, survey data and responses, and reward, incentive, and/or sweepstakes information.  Specific examples of this information, and the technology that collects it, are below:

_SSI’s Use of Cookies Generally._

Cookies are small files that store certain data on a device or computer. SSI may use session and persistent cookies for several purposes including, without limitation, to provide a better survey experience, quality control, validation, to enable or facilitate survey participation, tracking of completed surveys or other completed actions, and for fraud detection and/or prevention. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device or computer indefinitely until deleted.   

_Use of Cookies by Subcontractors Generally._

SSI uses third parties to provide services and certain functionality to SSI, including, without limitation, fraud detection services. SSI uses contracts with such third parties to control their use of cookies and to limit their use of cookies to the limited purposes set forth in the contracts.

_SSI’s Online Ad Effectiveness Program._

In connection with SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that SSI is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, SSI’s clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a “ **Third Party Technology** ” and collectively the “ **Third Party Technologies** ”). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, SSI’s servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and SSI’s client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, SSI’s client will send your UID and the specific survey to SSI and SSI will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. Additionally, if you participate, SSI may share your UID and data previously collected by SSI, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, (“ **Audience Measurement Data** ”), to third parties, including, without limitation, SSI’s subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).

**If you live outside of the EU and you have not previously agreed to participate in the Online Ad Effectiveness Program, as of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to participate.  If you wish to opt-out, please follow the opt-out process and procedures here.**

SSI’s Do Not Track Notice.

Do Not Track (“ **DNT** ”) is a preference in your browser that you can set to notify websites that you visit that you do not want the websites to collect certain information about you. SSI does not track individuals over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore SSI does not respond to DNT signals. If you object to SSI’s practice with regards to DNT signals, you may opt-out from participation or use of SSI’s services as described below.

In connection with SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, SSI permits SSI’s subcontractors, partners and/or clients to drop, set, and/or write Third Party Technologies for the purpose of facilitating audience measurement and ad recall survey activities; however, SSI’s online ad effectiveness program does not include, and does not facilitate, the targeting of advertisements to individuals. SSI is not responsible for any third party’s compliance with or response to DNT signals. To learn more about SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, please review the Cookies section of this Privacy Policy.
