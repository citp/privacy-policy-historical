<h1>Opscode Privacy Policy</h1>

<h4>Last Revised: November 23, 2009</h4>

<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected,
used, and disclosed by Opscode, Inc. ("Opscode, "we" or "us") with respect to
your use of the Web sites operated by Opscode that link to this Policy,
including without limitation www.opscode.com (collectively the "Sites") and any
services provided to you through the Sites (the "Services") so you can make an
informed decision about using the Sites.  We reserve the right to change the
provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been
made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you
to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any
personal information you provide will be used.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

<p>As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that
specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone
number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card or other account number);
information about that individual's location or activities, such as information
about his or her use of the Sites, when directly linked to personally
identifiable information; and demographic information such as date of birth,
gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other
personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include
"aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or
about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual
identities or other personal information has been removed. In other words,
information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with
information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us
understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new
features or otherwise tailor our Sites.  This policy in no way restricts or
limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

<h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>

<p><strong>Active Collection:</strong> Personal information may be collected in a number of ways
when you visit our Sites.  We may collect certain information you voluntarily
provide to us which may contain personal information.  For example, we may
collect your name, user name, address, email address, telephone number, other
contact and demographic information when you register and set up an account,
fill out a form, submit a comment or contact us by e-mail or other means.  We
may also collect billing information, such as your credit card number, when you
purchase Services or other items through the Sites.  Personal and demographic
information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection
with creating a profile, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or
message to another user or otherwise participating in any interactive forums or
community features on the Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Passive Collection:</strong> When you use the Site, some information is also
automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your
operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and
your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if
we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned
above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. We may automatically collect
certain information through the use of "cookies" or web beacons.  Cookies are
small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web
site to  enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and
retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. Among other
things, cookies help us improve our Sites and your experience. For example, we
use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to
our Sites.  If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we
will treat this information as personal information.  Web beacons (also know as
clear gifs) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Sites or
in emails relating to the Sites to collect certain information and monitor user
activity on the Sites. For example, we may use web beacons to deliver cookies,
count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an
email has been opened and acted upon We may also use third parties to help us
track and analyze aggregate usage and statistical data from individuals who use
the Sites.  These third parties may place cookies, web beacons or other devices
on your computer to collect nonpersonal information, and information provided by
these devices may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to determine the
popularity of certain content, and to better understand the usage and visitation
of our Sites and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This policy
does not apply to the use of third party cookies or web beacons.</p>

<p>If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your
browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.  However, if a browser is
set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the
Sites may not function properly.</p>

<h3>HOW DO WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h3>

<p>In general, we use personal information we collect to process your requests or
transactions; to provide you with information, products or Services you request;
to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services
we think will be of interest to you; to facilitate your use of, and our
administration and operation of, the Site; and for the purpose for which the
information was provided. For example, we may use the information we collect:</p>

<ul>
<li>to send you a welcoming email and to contact you about your use of the Site;</li>
<li>to provide the services, products or information you request and to complete
any transactions and process any payments in connection therewith;</li>
<li>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints;</li>
<li>to request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and improve the
Sites and our products and services;</li>
<li>to analyze data and trends and to personalize and improve site content and
features and your experience on the site, such as providing content or
features to match your profile and interests;</li>
<li>to contact you about our or our third party's services, products, activities,
special events or offers, and for other internal marketing, informational,
product development and promotional purposes</li>
</ul><p>Personal information provided online may be linked together or merged with other
personal information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you
about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition, if we
receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships,
we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain
about you.</p>

<p>Opscode may store and process personal information in the United States and
other countries.</p>

<h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h3>

<p>We will not share the personal information we collect from you through the Sites
with third parties except as described in this Policy, as it may be revised from
time to time.  We may share personal information with vendors, consultants and
other service providers ("Service Providers") who are engaged by or working with
us in connection with the operation of the Sites or the services we provide and
who need access to such information to carry out their work for us.  For
example, Opscode may use a third party to manage credit card processing.  In
some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the information from
you on our behalf.  We may also share personal information with other third
parties when you give us your consent to do so.  We are not responsible for the
actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for
any additional information you provide directly to these Service Providers or
other third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their
practices before disclosing information directly to them.  Nothing herein
restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared with third
parties without your consent.</p>

<p>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are
lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably
necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or
authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety
of Opscode, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation
to protect Opscode or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or
unlawful use of our Sites. If you send us a notification of claimed infringement
under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, any personal information in your
notification may be shared with the person or entity who you claim is infringing
your copyrighted material.  Information about our users, including personal
information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during
negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition or
in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of
the business assets of Opscode.</p>

<p>You understand that when you use the Sites, information you post in your
profile, recipe pages, blogs, bulletin boards, forums and other community areas
of the Sites (the "Community Areas"), as well as any information you share with
individuals through the Sites, will be available to other users and in some
cases may be publicly available.  We recommend you be cautious about giving out
personal information to others or sharing personal information in Community
Areas, whether designates as public or private.  We are not responsible for the
personal information you choose to share in these Community Areas or for the
actions of any third parties with whom you share personal information.</p>

<h3>WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE?</h3>

<p>Opscode takes reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an
effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration
and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security
measures are perfect or impenetrable. To help protect the confidentiality of
personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose
it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of our web site by any
person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your
password has been misused.</p>

<h3>WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Opscode by following any
instructions in those emails.  You may also send requests about your contact
preferences and changes to your information by emailing support@opscode.com.
However, if you opt out, this will not affect our ability to send you service
and account related emails, or other non-promotional emails, or to use your
personal information as otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

<h3>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</h3>

<p>Our web site may contain links to other web sites. Any personal information you
provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is
subject to that third party's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the
content or privacy and security practices and policies of web sites to which we
link. Links from our web site to third parties or to other sites are provided
for your convenience. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security
practices and policies before providing them with personal information.</p>
