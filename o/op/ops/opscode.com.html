<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This privacy policy
("Policy") explains how Personal Information is collected, used, and
disclosed by Chef Software, Inc. ("Chef, "we" or "us") with respect to
your use of the Web sites operated by Chef that link to this Policy,
including without limitation www.chef.io (collectively the
"Sites") and any services provided to you by Chef (the "Services"). We
reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.
We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the
Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this
Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any
Personal Information you provide will be used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please read this
policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding
your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with
our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Sites or
Services. By accessing or using the Sites or Services, you agree to
this privacy policy. Your continued use of the Sites or Services after
we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please
check the policy periodically for updates.</p>

<h4><em>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?</em></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used herein, the
term "Personal Information" means information that specifically
identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number,
mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card or other account
number); information about that individual's location or activities,
such as information about his or her use of the Sites and Services,
when directly linked to personally identifiable information; and
demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area
and preferences when such information is linked to other Personal
Information that identifies you. Personal information does not include
"aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the
Sites or about a group or category of products, services or users,
from which individual identities or other Personal Information has
been removed. In other words, information about how you use a Service
may be collected and combined with information about how others use
the same Service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our
users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise
tailor our Sites. This policy in no way restricts or limits our
collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

<h4><em>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</em></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Active Collection:</strong>
We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which
may contain Personal Information. For example, we may collect your
name, user name, address, email address, telephone number, other
contact and demographic information when you register and set up an
account, fill out a form, submit a comment or contact us by e-mail or
other means. We may also collect billing information, such as your
credit card number, when you purchase Services or other items through
the Sites. Personal and demographic information may also be collected
if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile,
leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to
another user or otherwise participating in any interactive forums or
community features on the Sites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Automatic
Collection:</strong> When you use the Sites, some information is also
automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address,
your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring
web site, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as
Personal Information if we combine it with or link it to any of the
identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the
aggregate only. We may automatically collect certain information
through the use of "cookies" or web beacons. Cookies are small data
files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web
site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited
them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and
history. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Sites and
your experience. For example, we use cookies to see which areas and
features are popular and to count visits to our Sites. If we link
cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this
information as Personal Information. Web beacons (also known as clear
gifs) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the
Sites or in emails relating to the Sites to collect certain
information and monitor user activity on the Sites. For example, we
may use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage
and campaign effectiveness and determine if an email has been opened
and acted upon. We may also use third parties to help us track and
analyze aggregate usage and statistical data from individuals who use
the Sites. These third parties may place cookies, web beacons or other
devices on your computer to collect nonpersonal Information, and
information provided by these devices may be used, among other things,
to analyze data, to determine the popularity of certain content, and
to better understand the usage and visitation of our Sites and the
other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply
to the use of third party cookies or web beacons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish to block,
erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser
manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if a browser is
set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions
of the Sites may not function properly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Information You
Provide to Us:</strong> You also may provide information in your profile,
recipe pages, blogs, bulletin boards, forums and other community areas
of the Sites (the "Community Areas"), to be transmitted to other users
of the Sites or third parties, as well as any information you share
with individuals through the Sites (collectively, "User
Contributions"). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted
to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other
users of the Sites with whom you may choose to share your User
Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your
User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You
understand that when you use the Community Areas, your User
Contributions will be available to other users and in some cases may
be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out
Personal Information to others or sharing Personal Information in
Community Areas, whether designated as public or private. We are not
responsible for the Personal Information you choose to share in these
Community Areas or for the actions of any third parties with whom you
share Personal Information.</p>

<h4><em>HOW DO WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</em></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, we use
Personal Information to process your requests or transactions; to
provide you with information, products or Services you request; to
inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or
services we think will be of interest to you; to facilitate your use
of, and our administration and operation of, the Site; and for the
purpose for which the information was provided. For example, we may
use the information we collect:</p>

<ul>
<li>to send you a welcoming email and to contact you about your use of
the Site;</li>
<li>to provide the services, products or information you request and to
complete any transactions and process any payments in connection
therewith;</li>
<li>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or
complaints;</li>
<li>to request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and
improve the Sites and our products and services;</li>
<li>to analyze data and trends and to personalize and improve site
content and features and your experience on the site, such as
providing content or features to match your profile and interests;</li>
<li>to contact you about our or our third party's services, products,
activities, special events or offers, and for other internal
marketing, informational, product development and promotional
purposes</li>
<li>To present our Sites and its contents to you</li>
<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you
request from us</li>
<li>To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it</li>
<li>To provide you with notices about your [account/subscription],
including expiration and renewal notices</li>
<li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any
contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and
collection</li>
<li>To notify you about changes to our Sites or any products or services
we offer or provide though it</li>
<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features on our Sites.</li>
<li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information</li>
<li>For any other purpose with your consent</li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Information
provided online may be linked together or merged with other Personal
Information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you
about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition,
if we receive information from third parties with whom we have
business relationships, we may combine this information with the other
Personal Information we maintain about you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chef may store and
process Personal Information in the United States and other countries.</p>

<h4><em>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH OTHER PARTIES?</em></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose
aggregated information about our users, and information that does not
identify any individual, without restriction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not share the
Personal Information we collect from you through the Sites with third
parties except as described in this Policy, as it may be revised from
time to time. We may share Personal Information with vendors,
consultants and other service providers ("Service Providers") who are
engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the
Sites or the services we provide and who need access to such
information to carry out their work for us. For example, Chef may use
a third party to manage credit card processing. In some cases, the
Service Provider may be directly collecting the information from you
on our behalf. We may also share Personal Information with other third
parties when you give us your consent to do so. We are not responsible
for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are
we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to
these Service Providers or other third parties, and we encourage you
to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information
directly to them. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregate
information, which may be shared with third parties without your
consent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose
Personal Information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully
authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably
necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process
or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights,
property or safety of Chef, our users, our employees or the public,
including without limitation to protect Chef or our users from
fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Sites. If
you send us a notification of claimed infringement under the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, any Personal Information in your
notification may be shared with the person or entity who you claim is
infringing your copyrighted material. Information about our users,
including Personal Information, may also be disclosed or transferred
as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
assets, financing or acquisition or in any other situation where
Personal Information may be transferred as one of the business assets
of Chef.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Example, we may
disclose Personal Information that we collect or you provide as
described in this privacy policy:</p>

<ul>
<li>To our subsidiaries and affiliates.</li>
<li>To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to
support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to
keep Personal Information confidential and use it only for the
purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
<li>To third parties we have engaged as partners to facilitate the sale
of our Services</li>
<li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture,
restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer
of some or all of Chef's assets, whether as a going concern or as
part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which
Personal Information held by Chef about our Sites users is among the
assets transferred.</li>
<li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.</li>
<li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the
information.</li>
<li>With your consent.</li>
</ul>


<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information:</p>

<ul>
<li>To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to
respond to any government or regulatory request.</li>
<li>To enforce or apply our <a href="/terms-of-service/">terms of
use</a>, <a href="/online-master-agreement/">terms of
sale</a>, <a href="/trademark-policy/">trademark
policy</a> and other agreements,
including for billing and collection purposes.</li>
<li>If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the
rights, property, or safety of Chef, our customers or others.</li>
</ul>


<h4><em>WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE?</em></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chef takes reasonable
measures to protect your Personal Information in an effort to prevent
loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and
destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no
security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To help protect the
confidentiality of Personal Information, you must keep your password
confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are
responsible for all uses of our Sites by any person using your
password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password
has been misused.</p>

<h4><em>WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION?</em></h4>

receiving promotional emails from Chef by following any instructions
in those emails. You may also send requests about your contact
preferences and changes to your information by emailing
<a href="mailto:support@chef.io">support@chef.io</a>. However, if
you opt out, this will not affect our ability to send you service and
account related emails, or other non-promotional emails, or to use
your Personal Information as otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

correct, update or delete any Personal Information we have collected,
you may do so by emailing
