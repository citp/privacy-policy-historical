You have the following rights regarding your Personal Data: 

1 Right of Access. 

You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge: 

  * information whether your Personal Data is retained, 

  * access to duplicates of the Personal Data retained, 




Upon your request, along with a duplicate of the data we retained, will provide you information related to – purpose of the processing, personal data we collect, entities to which we transferred them, time we keep your Personal Data, if possible and the criteria we used to decide the period, your rights as European Union Citizen, unless the data was collected directly from you, the source of the data, whether there is an automated decisional process, 

You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through your account. You may also request what other information we may hold. One request is free of charge, for the other we may charge a reasonable fee. If the effort of identifying data may be too much, or it may infringe with other people rights, we have the right to refuse it. 

2 Right to Rectification. 

When we process your Personal Data, we shall try to ensure that your Personal Data is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected. If your Personal Data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can change the information you provided by going to _<https://go.opswat.com/myuserright>_ and following the steps as described. 

  1. Right to suspend the processing 




You have the right to request the termination of the processing with or without deletion of the data we have collected where one of the following applies: 

  * the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data; 

  * the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead; 

  * the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; 

  * the data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. 



  1. Right to data portability 




You have the right to receive the Personal Data concerning you, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance us. 

  1. Right to delete. 




You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your User Account or by by going to _<https://go.opswat.com/myuserright>_ and following the steps as described. 

Because of deleting your User Account, you will lose access to services provided to you by OPSWAT.com 

We allow you to restore your User Account during a grace period of 30 (thirty) days from the moment you request deletion of your User Account. This functionality allows you not to lose your account by mistake, because of your loss of your account credentials or due to hacking. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the User Account deletion request. After the grace period, Personal Data associated with your account will be deleted. 

In some cases, deletion of your User Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if your account has a business relationship with US, you will only be able to delete your User Account after you have dissolved the business relationship. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months. 

5 Right to Object. 

When our processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you have the right to object to this processing. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing as described in Article 21 of the GDPR; in particular if the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal requirements. 

You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.

The third-party service providers identified above may use their own third-party subcontractors who have access to personal data (sub-processors). It is our policy to use only third-party providers that are bound to maintain appropriate levels of security and confidentiality, to process personal information only as instructed by us, and to flow those same obligations down to their sub-processors. 

IMPORTANT

We do not collect personally identifying information for sale to third parties. 

OPSWAT may disclose personal information to third parties under the following circumstances: 

  * When explicitly requested by you 

  * As otherwise set out in this OPSWAT.com Privacy Policy 




We may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement, regulatory and other government agencies, and to professional bodies and other third parties as required by and/or in accordance with applicable laws or regulations. This includes disclosures outside the country where you are located. 

Finally, we will disclose personal information if required in urgent circumstances, to protect the personal safety of individuals or the general public, or to maintain the uptime or stability of OPSWAT.com. 

Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing your personal information, we have implemented technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data. These measures also help us guard against accidental loss, destruction of, or damage to personal data. 

Only authorized persons are provided access to the personally identifiable information we have collected, and such individuals have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of this information. 

We safeguard the security of the personal information provided to us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Inside OPSWAT, data is stored in secure and controlled servers with limited access. 

Where we share your personal information with third-party providers, they may use subcontractors that have access to your personal data (sub-processors). It is our policy to use only third-party providers that are bound to maintain appropriate levels of security and confidentiality, to process personal information only as instructed by us, and to flow those same obligations down to their sub-processors. 

Note that your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where OPSWAT, its subsidiaries, or service providers are located. 

IMPORTANT

While we strive to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the personal information provided to us. Although we use appropriate security measures, once we have received your personal information, the transmission of data over the Internet (including via email) is never completely secure. We urge you to protect your personal information when using the Internet by, for example, changing passwords often, using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters (for example, % and $ and +) , and making sure to use a secure browser. 

If you create an account to use services associated with OPSWAT.com, we will retain your personal information while the account you’ve created remains active. We will also retain your information for as long as we have a legitimate business purpose to do so, and thereafter, for no longer than is required or permitted by law. This includes data you or others have provided to us, as well as data generated or inferred from your use of  OPSWAT.com  . 

Our privacy policy may be updated from time to time, and we will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy at OPSWAT.com privacy  policy  and revising the “Effective starting” date at the top of the policy.
