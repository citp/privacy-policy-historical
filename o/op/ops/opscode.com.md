**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR EUROPEAN USERS AND CUSTOMERS**

Please note that information covered by this Privacy Policy will be hosted and stored in the United States of America, which does not have similar data protection laws as the European Union and that, due to differing laws and legal practice, law enforcement agencies in the United States may have access to your Personal Information.

**WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

As used herein, the term “Personal Information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, personal website, account names on other services such as GitHub, Twitter and IRC, or credit card or other account number); information about that individual’s location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Sites and Services, when directly linked to personally identifiable information; and demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other Personal Information that identifies you. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or about a group or category of products, Services or users, from which individual identities or other Personal Information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a Service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same Service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Sites. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

**Active Collection:**  We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain Personal Information. For example, we may collect your name, user name, address, email address, telephone number, other contact and demographic information when you register and set up an account, fill out a form, submit a comment or contact us by e-mail or other means. We may also collect billing information, such as your credit card number, when you purchase Services or other items through the Sites. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or otherwise participating in any interactive forums or community features on the Sites.

**Automatic Collection:**  When you use the Sites, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the Sites.  Also, when packages are published in a package registry, the name and email address of the developer for the publish action is saved, along with the date and time of the publish. This information is shared on the Sites.  We treat this information as Personal Information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. When you use our Software, we will (if available) be able to see the relevant software license key. If the Software is licensed by us, we will be able to link that information with a specific license for the Software you are using. As for when you use our Sites, when you use our Software, we will automatically collect your IP address and operating system information. We also collect information on features used (such as API) and information on how frequently our Software is used.

**Information on Behalf of Our Clients:** Chef collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.

It is shared with employees and contractors of Chef, as needed to process information on Chef’s behalf.  Raw log data is not shared with third parties, but may be shared in aggregate.
