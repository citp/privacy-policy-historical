## How Do We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies?

When you visit the Site, we may collect, process and use informing about you which may not personally identify you but which may be helpful for improving the operation of the Site, such as “cookies.”

A cookie is a text file that stored on your computer. As text files, cookies cannot read information on your hard drive, run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies let our Site remember your preferences or recognize you when you return. You can delete cookies or configure your computer to reject them, although this may disable the Site’s ability to manage individual sessions.

As do many internet sites, we gather other information automatically, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

There are “do not track” or similar browser choices available to internet users with respect to online web activity, but given the present lack of consensus of what constitutes an informed election, appropriate trigger or breadth of scope of such choice, our Site will not operate any differently when a “do not track” signal is received.
