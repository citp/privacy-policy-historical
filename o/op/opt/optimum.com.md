### IV. Registration for Participation in Website Services

The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you to Cablevision or its affiliates.

Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). For each sweepstakes and/or special event, we will post on the website applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions.

### Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers

The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To process an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider. The operational provider may also share your personal information with us.

Cablevision respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen.

We have developed this site to appeal to adult visitors (visitors who are eighteen and older). Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we only collect personal information from adult visitors who have requested information about our cable or other services and who can verify credit and billing information. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable information from our records.

If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law. For example, we may collect personal information from a child to provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian; to respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information; to protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; to protect the security or integrity of the site, to take precautions against liability or to respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.
