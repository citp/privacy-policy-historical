Website Privacy Policy

Click below for specific information about: 

**To our website visitors** \- Cablevision respects your privacy rights. This website Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is designed to provide you with information about how Cablevision protects your privacy in connection with your use of this website. **By using any of our Cablevision websites that linked you to this policy, you accept this Privacy Policy.**.

**To our customers** \- If you are also a subscriber of any of Cablevision's cable television services (such as iO TV), our high-speed Internet services (such as Optimum Online), our voice services (such as Optimum Voice), other online services (such as interactive television channels including Optimum Autos and Optimum Homes), or any other Cablevision cable service or communication service, we encourage you to review the separate privacy policies and terms of use agreements for those services. Cablevision's other services are governed by those separate privacy policies and agreements. The use of [Optimum.com](http://www.optimum.com/), [Optimumrewards.com](http://www.optimumrewards.com/) and [Optimumstore.com](http://www.optimumstore.com/) is governed by this Privacy Policy. Your use of Optimum.net is not covered by this privacy policy, but is instead governed by the [Cablevision Customer Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/Privacy/Sub).

A. How we collect visitor information

CSC Holdings, Inc. ("Cablevision") operates this website. In this Privacy Policy, "we," "us," "Cablevision," and "our" refer to CSC Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates. We use the term "visitor" to refer to a person who accesses any part of the website for any amount of time.

We may collect, maintain, and access certain information you provide and information collected from your use of the website and services available through the website. This visitor information may include information that can be associated with you personally ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Visitor information may include, among other things, your first and last name, your home addresses, and your telephone number, your Cablevision account information, and your payment card information.

We will collect Personally Identifiable Information about you when you voluntarily provide it to us. When you use website features that ask you for certain information, for example, when you register for membership in Optimum Rewards, log in to the OptimumStore.com, or make a purchase at the OptimumStore.com, you provide Personally Identifiable Information. You can navigate through the website without giving us Personally Identifiable Information, but certain activities such as browsing prices and making purchases at the OptimumStore.com or obtaining offers and discounts through Optimumrewards.com is only available to our customers who log in.

We may also collect Personally Identifiable Information if we survey visitors about various topics, including their television viewing preferences and how we can improve our programming, website, and services. Responding to any such survey is entirely voluntary.

Personally Identifiable Information does not include aggregated data, anonymized information, or other information that does not identify a particular person. Your zip code and gender are examples of types of data we collect that are not Personally Identifiable Information. We may generate anonymized or aggregated information from the information we collect. This is information from which any Personally Identifiable Information has been removed. Anonymized or aggregated information does not identify you. Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymized and aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Policy. Anonymized or aggregated information may include, among other things, Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, duration of visit, and domain type. This aggregated information will not reveal any Personally Identifiable Information about any specific visitor.

We may also collect visitor information in the following ways: 

  * **Cookies**. Similar to most website operators, we use "cookies" to collect information about your visit to our website and to manage information concerning your preferences. A cookie is a small encrypted computer code added to a file on your computer as a record of its visit. It does not collect or provide your name or any other personal information about you. It can, however, be used by this website to note information about your visit, such as your type of web browser, operating system and Internet Protocol address, to better tailor the site for you. It can also be used to recognize you when you return as a repeat visitor to our website. We use cookies, for example, to monitor the times when visitors log-on to the website, to track the number of sweepstakes and promotions you enter, to estimate the audience size of the website for sponsors and advertisers, and to track visitor preferences. Cookies do not allow the website to access Personally Identifiable Information that you have not otherwise provided. You can control what cookies are accepted by your computer through the settings on your web browser or by deleting them from your computer. Doing so, however, may limit the personalization available to you. We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to help deliver, manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Cablevision or Optimum network of sites or other networks or sites. This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising. For more information regarding third-party ad servers, see "Service providers' and other third parties' collection and use of information" below.
  * **Clear GIFs.** Like many websites, we may use clear GIFs (also known as "web beacons," "Internet tags," or "pixel tags"). Clear GIFs are lines of code that allow websites to summarize overall visitor usage patterns and to provide personalized services. We may use clear GIFs, for instance, to track visitor preferences or to gather aggregated information about visitor usage patterns. We do not use clear GIFs to collect any Personally Identifiable Information about visitors.
  * **Passive Automatic Electronic Collection.** Like operators of most other websites, we collect and log information automatically, either directly or through a third party service provider. For example, we collect your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the name and location of your Internet Service Provider, the type and version of your browser, the length of time you visit the website, your search queries on the website, and the average number of pages you viewed. Logging your IP address does not by itself provide us with your name, email address, or home or work address. We use this log information for systems administration purposes and for technical troubleshooting. We may also use it to gather general demographic information about you, such as your general location.



B. How we use visitor information

We use Personally Identifiable Information collected from visitors, from Optimum Rewards members and from customers logged in at the OptimumStore.com for several important purposes, including: 

  * to help us fulfill service requests;
  * to notify you about sweepstakes and promotional events and to allow you to participate in those sweepstakes and events;
  * to protect the security of visitors and the website;
  * to facilitate e-commerce transactions, such as purchases of goods and services;
  * to help prevent fraud;
  * to provide you with a website and services of enhanced value to you; and
  * to market and promote our services and website.



Some of the sweepstakes and special events that we may notify you about may be produced with the support of non-affiliated sponsors or our promotional partners. We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected in conjunction with such events to market additional services and events by Cablevision, by its promotional partners, by sponsors, or by all of these entities. For each sweepstakes and special or promotional event, we will post applicable rules for the event on the website. We may also post on the website any supplemental terms, conditions, or privacy provisions for the specific event.

We use anonymized or aggregated information to improve website services, to gauge the effectiveness of the website, and to improve and enhance visitors' experiences on the website. In some cases we may combine information collected from customers logged in at the OptimumStore.com with demographic or other information (such as census records or customer information in our regular business records) for aggregated and anonymized studies. We use such studies to improve, market and promote our services and this website. We do not use these studies to identify your individual browsing or purchasing or to tailor advertising to individual visitors.

C. When we disclose visitor information

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose Personally Identifiable Information collected through the website to entities other than to Cablevision affiliates unless (a) it is necessary to enable us to provide services or to conduct legitimate business activities related to the website; or (b) you give your consent before we disclose your Personally Identifiable Information.

We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with persons or companies who help us operate the website by providing services, such as sweepstakes fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce contractors (collectively "service providers"). We may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to other third parties when you expressly consent, such as when you make a purchase from a third-party vendor using our website. If you use a payment card for goods or services on the website, our service providers may share your Personally Identifiable Information and payment card data with others, for example with a ticket agent, a payment card processing company, and a shipping or fulfillment company, to complete your purchases and orders. 

We contractually require our service providers to maintain at least the same level of confidentiality for the Personally Identifiable Information we provide to them as we maintain for such information. Additionally, we require that our service providers' use of such information not exceed that needed to provide the service. 

We currently conduct joint activities with Cablevision affiliates. We will not share visitors' Personally Identifiable Information collected through the website with our affiliates except as provided in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose the content of any e-mail visitors send to us to our affiliates or to other persons. Please see our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/Terms).

We may provide aggregated or anonymized information about visitors to our advertisers, to sponsors, to promotional partners, and to affiliates. Such information may include, for example, how many persons visited a particular page or activity and the preferences and dislikes of visitors. Such information does not include Personally Identifiable Information about any individual visitor. 

You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if we are required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary (a) to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process; (b) to investigate violations of this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or other contracts we have with you; (c) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) to respond to your requests for customer service; and (e) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the public, Cablevision, its agents, its users, or the website. 

We reserve the right to disclose and transfer your visitor information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all, or components, of our business. 

D. How long we will keep visitor information

Cablevision may retain Personally Identifiable Information and other information collected through the website for as long as is reasonable for the purposes for which it was collected. 

E. How we protect visitor information

We follow industry-standard practices to protect information collected through the website. Visitors' Personally Identifiable Information is stored in Cablevision databases in physically secure facilities. Visitors' financial and payment card information is transmitted via encrypted technology. If we share visitor information with Cablevision affiliates, the affiliate will follow similar practices to protect Personally Identifiable Information collected through the website.

Any information transmitted over the Internet may be subject to breaches of security. Although we follow commercially reasonable practices to securely store the information we collect and to work with responsible third parties, we cannot guarantee these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose such information.

F. Service providers' and other third parties' collection and use of information

Cablevision may provide opportunities for visitors to purchase certain goods and services through this website. Our service providers may handle some of these transactions. If you choose to use these services, our service providers may request that you provide your Personally Identifiable Information to them so that they can process your order or request. These service providers usually have their own privacy policies and terms of use. After you leave this website, information you disclose to a service provider and information the service provider collects from you will be subject to its privacy policy and terms of use. Cablevision is not responsible for its service providers' collection, use, or disclosure of information.

This website may include banner ads, other advertisements, and links to websites of Cablevision affiliates and non-Cablevision entities. These affiliates and other entities may solicit and collect Personally Identifiable Information and may store cookies on website visitors' computers. When you leave this website to visit the website of a Cablevision affiliate or of another entity, you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of use agreement of that website operator. Cablevision is not responsible for the ads, links, content, activities, or information practices of other websites.

We may use the services of third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies or web beacons to facilitate the delivery of ads to you. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or business partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of cookies or web beacons by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/Article/Optout) for a representative list of these third party advertising companies and links to more information about their practices and how to opt-out of.

G. How we protect children's online privacy

This website is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have received Personally Identifiable Information of a child under 13, we will delete the information from our records. We offer parents and guardians additional guidelines to help keep their children's personal information safe and your family's Internet participation enjoyable.
