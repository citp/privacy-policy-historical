We do collect certain personal information automatically, and, if you wish to communicate with us via email, you may need to supply us with information relating to the purpose of your communication in order to enable us to provide you with a useful reply.

If you choose to register for a seminar, the virtual trading system or other offered programs, or ask to request to receive materials, we may require certain information from you, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We may also provide your name and address to third parties for purposes of sending you the information requested. In addition, we may rely on third party vendors to collect certain transaction and user information required to process any payment due for the transaction. Unless you specifically request us not to do so (by sending an e-mail to [options@theocc.com](mailto:%20options@theocc.com)), your name, mailing address, and e-mail address will be included in a potential investor database. This database is not sold, but may be distributed to our members and participants including interested broker-dealers or the options exchanges, or in some cases, the database may be distributed to third parties to provide you with information regarding upcoming OIC seminars, events, or other OIC related marketing materials. OIC does not allow the use of the information provided for reasons unrelated to options and other investment products. OIC has no responsibility for or control over the use to which third parties may put the investor database.

If you communicate with us via e-mail, you may need to supply us with information relating to the purpose of your communication in order to enable us to provide you with a useful reply. In some cases, we might forward an e-mail sent to us to a third party to facilitate an appropriate response.
