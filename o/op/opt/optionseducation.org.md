# Privacy Policy

The Options Industry Council respects your expectations of privacy. This Policy describes the ways in which we use information provided by users of this website. 

## Collection and Use of Personal Information

In general, you can visit OIC's website without telling us who you are or revealing personal information about yourself. We do collect certain personal information automatically, and, if you wish to communicate with us via email, you may need to supply us with information relating to the purpose of your communication in order to enable us to provide you with a useful reply. 

## Automatically Collected Information

If you visit the OIC website, our web server collects and stores information with respect to: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software and operating system you are using; the date and time at which you access the OIC website; and the address of the Internet site from which you linked directly to the site.

The OIC website also uses "cookie" technology. A cookie is an element of data that a website sends to the browser of a user of the website.

OIC does not use cookies to aggregate information with respect to use of the Internet from a particular email address. 

## Voluntarily Provided Information

If you choose to register for a seminar, the virtual trading system or other offered programs, or ask to request to receive materials, we may require certain information from you, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We may also provide your name and address to third parties for purposes of sending you the information requested. In addition, we may rely on third party vendors to collect certain transaction and user information required to process any payment due for the transaction. Unless you specifically request us not to do so (by sending an e-mail to [options@theocc.com](mailto:options@theocc.com)), your name, mailing address, and e-mail address will be included in a potential investor database. This database is not sold, but may be distributed to interested broker-dealers or the options exchanges, or in some cases, the database may be distributed to third parties to provide you with information regarding upcoming OIC seminars, events, or other OIC related marketing materials. OIC has no responsibility for or control over the use to which third parties may put the investor database.

If you communicate with us via e-mail, you may need to supply us with information relating to the purpose of your communication in order to enable us to provide you with a useful reply. In some cases, we might forward an e-mail sent to us to a third party to facilitate an appropriate response.

You should note that e-mail is not necessarily secure from interception. The e-mail address or addresses identified in the OIC website do not have encryption capability. You should consider whether information of a particularly personal or sensitive nature is appropriate to include in an email.

OIC might use information provided to us by a user of this website to further inform and educate users about U.S. listed options, or to improve the website or the information that OIC makes publicly available. However, if we were to do so, we would not identify the source of the information provided to us.
