<p><strong>Internet privacy policy</strong></p>

Please note, these companies are independent third parties over which OPTIMIZERx exercises no control. Therefore, we are not liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.</p>


	<p><strong>Links to other sites</strong></p>


	<p>As a resource to our visitors, OPTIMIZERx provides links to other Web sites. We try to carefully choose Web sites we believe are useful and meet our high standards. However, because Web sites can change so quickly, we can’t guarantee the standards of every Web site link we provide or be responsible for the content of non-OPTIMIZERx sites.</p>

Our network access to the infrastructure is protected by a firewall protection system. Member information is backed up on a periodic basis to protect against accidental loss. However, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and OPTIMIZERx will not be intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access.
