## 6\. Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Optimizely does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete the information we have stored as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us as indicated in the "Contact Us" section below. 

## 7\. Storage and Processing

Your information may be stored and processed in – and we may transfer information to – the U.S. and other countries where Optimizely (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) and our advertising partners and service providers maintain systems and facilities. In addition, information that we collect about you (including personal information) may be transferred to our affiliated entities and/or to other third parties across borders and/or from your country to other countries around the world. 

You acknowledge that we may transfer information to the U.S., to any country in which Optimizely, its advertising partners, and its service providers maintain systems or facilities, and to other countries globally. 

If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, you acknowledge that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, consistent with our legal obligations governing the transfer of such data. 

## 8\. Data Security and Integrity

Optimizely is concerned about the security of your data. We have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods. 

Please be aware, though, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to Optimizely will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. 

If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on the Site or Optimizely Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. 

## 9\. Data Retention

How long we keep the personal information we collect depends on the type of information, the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and similar factors. In general, we will retain your personal information for the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy (including for as long as need to provide you or our customer with products and services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will also retain and use your information for as long as necessary to resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements. We retain your account information for the Optimizely Services for as long as your employer’s account is active and thereafter unless your employer requests deletion. Non-personally identifiable and aggregated information may be stored indefinitely.

Please remember that your browsing and interaction on any third-party website, service or application, including those that have a link or advertisement on our Site, are subject to that third party’s own rules, policies, and practices, and not our privacy policy.

  * **Notice to End Users of the Optimizely Services.** The Optimizely Services are primarily intended for use by organizations.

We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. 

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Optimizely is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

**Additional Disclosures for EEA Data Subjects:**

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Sites and Optimizely Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:

  * We need it to provide or operate the Sites and Optimizely Services, including to provide customer support and process your orders, requests, questions and concerns;

  * It satisfies another legitimate interest that is not overridden by your data protection interests, including our interest in:

    * collecting product usage, analytics and performance data relating to our Sites and the Optimizely Services, in order to maintain, analyze, develop, update, and improve our products and services;

    * maintaining records of bugs, customer support requests and similar requests you file, and our response to these requests; 

    * using information to personalize content and features on our Sites and the Optimizely Services; 

    * detecting, investigating and preventing activities that may violate our policies or applicable laws (such as fraud detection and prevention);

    * maintaining corporate or business records consistent with our retention policies and applicable laws;

    * protecting against activities that may threaten the security, integrity, or availability of our or another party’s products, systems, and services; and 

    * for marketing and selling our products and services, consistent with applicable laws.

  * We are processing your information to protect our legal rights;

  * You give us consent to process your personal data; 

  * We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation, such as a lawful subpoena or law-enforcement request or to fulfill the lawful instructions of our customers (when they are acting as the controller); and/or

  * We have another lawful basis for processing in accordance with applicable EU laws.




If an individual in the EEA has consented to our use of their personal information, and our processing is based on that consent, that individual has the right to withdraw their consent in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“ **GDPR** ”), but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, individuals in the EEA have the right to object to that use as specified in Article 21 of the GDPR, though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Sites or Optimizely Service. Optimizely further acknowledges that EEA data subjects have certain other rights under the GDPR, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to request from the controller access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data, restriction of processing concerning the data subject, and data portability (in each case, as specified under the GDPR). Where Optimizely is acting as a controller, you can initiate a request by contacting us as specified in the “Contacting Us” section below. Please note that if you object to or restrict processing, you may not be able to use the Sites and Optimizely Services or certain features any longer. 

EEA and Swiss data subjects can contact Optimizely’s data protection officer by emailing [dpo@optimizely.com](mailto:dpo@optimizely.com).
