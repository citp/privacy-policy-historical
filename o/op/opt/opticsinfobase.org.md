#### Information Collection

OSA is the sole owner of the information collected on www.osa.org and affiliated sites. OSA collects information at several different points on the Web site.

Periodically, a user must complete a registration form to register for OSA events. During registration a user is required to give contact information. This information is used to contact the user about the event for which the user has registered or related events, services and products. The attendee lists for OSA Topical Meetings are made available to attendees for networking purposes.

Authors and reviewers may provide personal information in the process of submitting a manuscript or review, or when establishing reviewer expertise profiles. We do not distribute personally identifiable information except as is consistent with the scholarly publishing peer-review process (e.g., for the purpose of introducing your submission to an editorial review board).

While placing an order, a user is asked to provide contact information and financial information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill the customer's order. If there is a problem processing an order, the information may be used to contact the user.

Information is collected through cookies, log files, link tracking, and/or third parties. Some of the collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user.

#### Cookies

OSA may use cookies to record session information such as items that visitors add to their shopping cart.

#### Database Confidentiality

OSA does not sell or share email addresses with other organizations without the express permission of the user. OSA does not sell contact information from the database to non-corporate members.

Contact information for OSA members is automatically included in the directory of members, which is available to members, unless an OSA member has opted out.

#### Log Files

Web site log files are used to store information such as: internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement within the site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. The log files are used by utility tracking software to analyze user movement.

Database download logs track which articles have been downloaded by which IP (for institutional subscriptions) or individual (for individual subscriptions). If downloads exceed a standard level, the individual or institution will receive a warning and service may be disconnected. This action is taken to ensure that the systems remain available to all subscribers. Individuals have access to a report that details the articles they have downloaded. Institutions have access to a report that details the articles downloaded by IP addresses at their institution.

#### Email tracking

Link tracking is used within HTML-based emails to track which links have been clicked by the recipients. This tracking provides a means to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

#### Legal Disclaimer

Though every effort is made to preserve user privacy, it may be necessary to disclose personal information when required by law, such as in compliance with a court order or other legal or governmental process.

#### Notifications

OSA may use your information to provide you with information on new products, services, or upcoming events. More and more OSA information is provided by email, so you may not receive notices on these subjects if you opt-out. If you wish not to receive email from OSA, you may use the "unsubscribe" link provided at the bottom of every email.

OSA may also use your contact information to reach you through phone, mail or fax. Please send an email to custserv@osa.org or call 202.416.1907 or 1.800.766.4672 if you wish to be removed from all contacts by these methods.

If you are an OSA member, you may not opt out of OSA business mailings such as the election mailing.

#### Ad Servers

OSA does not partner with nor have special relationships with ad server companies.

#### Links

This Web site may contain links to non-OSA sites. OSA is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by OSA-hosted and maintained Web sites.

#### Online Discussion Forums

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

#### Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect user information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

SSL encryption software is used on forms requesting financial information. Full credit card numbers are not stored in our databases.

User information is restricted within the OSA offices. Employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Servers that store personally identifiable information are in a locked facility.

#### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires the services provided, send an email to Customer Service at [custserv@osa.org](mailto:custserv@osa.org), or contact OSA by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.
