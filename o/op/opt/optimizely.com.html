  <h1>Optimizely, Inc.</h1>

  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

  <br>

  <h4>Effective Date: July 2, 2010.</h4>

    collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your
    information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy
    does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other
    sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning
    given them in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

    and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program
    requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection
    and use of your personal information.  TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party,

  </p><h3 class="margin">Information We Collect</h3>

  <p><b>Our Service:</b>
    We may collect personally identifiable information about you through our website when
    you register for an account, such as your email.  If you choose to purchase a product
    from us, we will collect your payment information also.  We also collect data
    through our partners (customers) who use our Service (including by embedding our code on their
    websites) to analyze usage of their websites. When you visit such websites, your
    browser may send us certain information about you as described below. We do not send any
    promotional emails, however we may send you service related emails related to your account. </p>

  <p><b>Cookies Information:</b>
    We may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
    characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets learn about
    your behavior and usage patterns when you are on our site. A cookie may also convey anonymous information about
    how you browse the a partner website to us. A cookie does not collect personal
    information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you
    close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on
    subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following
    your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears
    after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all
    cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>

  <p><b>Log File Information:</b>
    Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a
    web page on our site. When you access the Service, our servers automatically record certain
    information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These
    server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
    ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks,
    domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

  <p><b>Clear Gifs Information:</b>
    When you access the Service or are on our web site, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons)
    which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No
    personally identifiable information from your Optimizely account is collected
    using these clear gifs. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting,
    improve the effectiveness of our Service, and make Optimizely better for our users
    and partners.</p>

    <p>These technologies mentioned above do not  collect personal information about you and only
    collect data in the aggregate.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">How We Use Your Information</h3>

  <p>We use the information that we collect to operate and maintain our Service,
    and to help our partners improve their online offerings.</p>

  <p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) monitor the
    effectiveness of our Service and the offerings of our partners; (b) monitor
    aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic
    patterns; (c) diagnose or fix technology problems.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">How We Share Your Information</h3>

  <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b>
    Optimizely will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others.
    We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of
    Optimizely (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>

  <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.
    Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred
    business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign
    such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p>

  <p><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b>
    We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data,
    referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with
    interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain
    Optimizely services and those of our partners. Non-personally identifiable information
    may be stored indefinitely.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">How We Protect Your Information</h3>

  <p>Optimizely is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot
    ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Optimizely
    or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed,
    altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical, or managerial
    safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number ) on our registration
     or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  </p>

  <p>We use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase
  services.  These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for
  any other purposes.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">Compromise of Personal Information</h3>

  <p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach
    of security, Optimizely will promptly notify those persons whose personal
    information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures
    set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">Your Choices About Your Information</h3>

  <p>You can review and correct the information about you that Optimizely keeps on
    file by logging into your account to update your password and billing information. Alternately,
    you can contact us directly at
    <a href="mailto:support@optimizely.com">support@optimizely.com</a></p>

  <h3 class="margin">Children's Privacy</h3>

  <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Optimizely
    does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under
    the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself
    to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one
    under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to Optimizely. In
    the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a
    child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete
    that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any
    information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:support@optimizely.com">support@optimizely.com</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">Notification Procedures</h3>

  <p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law
    or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email
    notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such
    notice on the Service, as determined by Optimizely in its sole discretion. We
    reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to
    you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as
    described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">Features on our site.</h3>

  <p>If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any
    personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used
    by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
    We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.
    We also have testimonials on our site, for which users have given permission to have their
    personal information posted on our site with their testimonial.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

  <p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those
    of other sites. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information
    is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy
    statement of any Web site you visit.</p>


  <h3 class="margin">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>

  <p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures materially, we will post
    those changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect,
    how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to
    this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
