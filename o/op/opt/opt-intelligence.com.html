					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				</div>
				<div id="privacyBody">
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>This web site located at www.opt-intelligence.com (the "Web Site") is owned and operated by Opt-Intelligence, Inc. We recognize the importance of privacy to you and the other users of the Opt-Intelligence services (the "Services"). Opt-Intelligence is providing this notice to explain our online information practices. This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and collection of data collected by Us in the course of providing the Services and does not apply to any other data collected by Us online or offline.</p>
					<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, "we" includes Opt-Intelligence and any third-party vendors we hire to assist in the administration of the Web Site and/or the processing or handling of customer information. These vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the user information and are prohibited from using it for any purpose other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
					<h2>The Opt-Intelligence Services</h2>
					<p>Opt-Intelligence, Inc. provides easy to use Services to businesses with websites and to advertisers that are trying to reach the users of those websites. The Services link companies that are collecting consumer data on their websites ("Web Publisher Clients") and companies that want to collect consumer data ("Advertisers") by allowing consumers visiting and/or registering on websites of Web Publisher Clients to explicitly request that their registration data be sent to one or more specific Advertisers presenting offers using Opt-Intelligence's Services.</p>
					<h2>You may Opt-In to Advertiser Offers</h2>
					<p>The Opt-Intelligence Services allow You, as a visitor or a registrant on the Web Publisher Client website, the ability to view, request and receive special offers provided by Advertisers working with Opt-Intelligence. When You visit a website of a Web Publisher Client that is working with Opt-Intelligence, You may be presented with an Opt-Intelligence offer placement or web page each listing one or more special offers from certain Advertisers working with Opt-Intelligence. You may choose which offer(s) You would like to receive or hear more about by simply clicking on the box or "yes" radio button adjacent to the offer(s) or selecting a positive response in the manner indicated. You can choose some offers, all of them, or none of them—it's up to You.</p>
					<h2>How Opt-Intelligence Receives, Uses and Discloses Your Personal Information</h2>
					<p>The Web Publisher Client on whose website You just visited or registered (or previously registered) may transfer, subject to its own privacy policy, Your personal information and certain other non-personal information to Opt-Intelligence. By choosing an offer and clicking the Submit/Continue button, you authorize Opt-Intelligence to pass Your personal information on to the Advertiser(s) whose offer You selected to receive. If You do not opt-in to any offers presented, Your personal information transferred to Opt-Intelligence, if any, will be deleted from the Opt-Intelligence servers in accordance with its then current policies and procedures with no further action by You. Because neither Opt-Intelligence nor the Web Publisher Client have direct control over the content of the Advertisers' offer(s) or the quality of the goods or services offered via such offer(s), You acknowledge and agree that neither Opt-Intelligence nor the Web Publisher Client is responsible for and in no way guarantees or endorses: (1) the availability of the offer(s) offered by the Advertiser(s); or (2) the goods or services offered via such offer(s) by the Advertiser(s). Accordingly, You acknowledge and agree that neither Opt-Intelligence nor the Web Publisher Client shall be responsible or liable to You in any manner, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or allegedly caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on the content of any offer(s), any of the Advertiser(s) website(s) and/or the quality of any goods or services offered by or through any Advertiser offer(s) or website(s).</p>
					<p>From time to time, as You opt-in to certain offers via an offer placement or offer page, Opt-Intelligence may request additional personal information from You so that You may participate in optional surveys, contests or other promotional programs. You may choose to provide the additional contact information to Opt-Intelligence. The additional information may be shared with third parties.</p>
					<p>As further protection for You, upon submitting Your opt-in selections, Opt-Intelligence may send You an automated e-mail confirming each of Your offer selections. If You decide not to receive information from that Advertiser, simply opt-out of the offer by using the directions included in the email message. If You opt-out of the offer by using the directions included in the email message, Your personal information will be deleted from the Opt-Intelligence servers in accordance with our then current policies and procedures and will not be sent to the applicable Advertiser(s). However, if Your information has already been sent to the Advertiser(s), Opt-Intelligence will send a notice of Your opt-out to the applicable Advertiser(s). In every case where Opt-Intelligence sends out an automated e-mail, You will be shown how to contact the Advertiser directly. Since information about You will be provided to the Advertiser(s) of Your selected offer(s) and Opt-Intelligence has no control over the use or distribution of Your personal information once it is passed to an Advertiser, We strongly encourage You to review the privacy policy of the Web Publisher Client and each Advertiser which provides offers to which You opt-in before making a selection.</p>
					<p>In addition, Opt-Intelligence shall have the right to share Your personally identifying information with any third-party, (i) as required by law, (ii) to protect and defend the rights of Opt-Intelligence, a Web Publisher Client, an Advertiser or any other user of the Services, (iii) as incident to a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or similar event without Your consent or approval and without notice to You, (iv) under circumstances We believe reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety of users of the Opt-Intelligence Services or the public, or (v) as is otherwise described in this Privacy Policy and that of the Web Publisher Client.</p>
					<p>Opt-Intelligence may receive Your personal information and/or certain non-personal information from Web Publisher Clients, store that information on Opt-Intelligence servers as described in this Privacy Policy, and disclose Your personal information only to Advertisers selected by You. By opting-in to one or more offers via an offer placement or offer page, You consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Your personal and non-personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and that of the Web Publisher Client and Advertiser. Opt-Intelligence does not use Your personal information for purposes other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
					<h2>Opt-Intelligence Collects and Uses Non-Personal, Traffic or Click-Stream Data and Pixel Tags</h2>
					<p>Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information by Opt-Intelligence. Opt-Intelligence may share the non-personal, traffic or click-stream information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, We may tell an Advertiser that a certain number of people viewed its offer. Opt-Intelligence's servers collect non-personal information about the Web Publisher Client's website from which You were presented an offer page and may share that information with both Advertisers and Web Publisher Clients. In addition to the foregoing, Opt-Intelligence uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design and market the Services and to better target Advertiser(s) offer(s) on Web Publisher Client websites. Opt-Intelligence notes some of the Advertiser websites You visit in relation to the offer(s) You opted-in for through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). The information collected by Opt-Intelligence through the use of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable.</p>
					<h2>Security of Data Stored by Opt-Intelligence</h2>
					<p>Opt-Intelligence has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While We make reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-parties from illegally obtaining this information. You should consider any communication that You transmit to Opt-Intelligence (such as personally identifiable or other data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that neither Opt-Intelligence, the Web Publisher Client(s) nor the Advertiser(s) shall be liable or responsible if any information about You is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.</p>
					<h2>Collection of Personally Identifying Information from or about Children</h2>
					<p>Opt-Intelligence uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Neither the Services nor the offers presented on an offer page or via an offer placement are targeted at children.</p>
					<h2>International Users</h2>
					<p>Personal data that You have voluntarily entered electronically is delivered to servers located in the United States. By using this Web Site, any Web Publisher Client website or opting-in to any Advertiser's offer(s), You consent to the transfer of this personal and non-personal data, and to our use of such personal and non-personal data as outlined in this Privacy Policy and that of the Web Publisher Client and Advertiser.</p>
					<h2>Access or Correction of Your Personally Identifying Information</h2>
					<p>To request a copy of Your personally identifiable information stored by Opt-Intelligence, please send an e-mail containing Your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@opt-intelligence.com">privacy@opt-intelligence.com</a>. You must provide Your full name, e-mail address and any other information reasonably requested by Opt-Intelligence. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the e-mail message.</p>
					<h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>Opt-Intelligence and Web Publisher Client may, from time to time each in its sole discretion, change or modify this Privacy Policy. Any changes or modification will be effective upon posting of the revisions at www.opt-intelligence.com. Opt-Intelligence may post changes or modifications to referenced policies and guidelines without Your approval, and may determine whether and when any such changes apply to You. Opting-in to any offer(s) on the offer page or offer placement following Opt-Intelligence's posting of any changes or modifications will constitute Your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Should You not wish to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy of Opt-Intelligence, do not opt-in to any offer(s) on the offer page or offer placement page.</p>
