SECURITY & PRIVACY.
At Optimal Blue, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our website. When we collect
information from you, we want you to know how it is used. Because of the financial nature of our business, our
websites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit
or receive any information from children.
WEBSITE INFORMATION PRACTICES.
To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our websites. Here is a
description of the information we collect and how it is used:
     •   Tools, Applications and Registration: We provide a number of ways for you to explore your options for
         mortgage and lending practices, so you can determine which options may be the most desirable for you.
         You can engage a number of resources, without providing us your identity. We will not ask you for
         personally identifiable information to use these features, and do not attribute the information that you
         provide to you as an individual. However, if you opt into receiving services, we will ask you to register at
         the site and supply other identifying and supporting information needed to process your application. By
         registering, you can save information for later review and update. When you register, you select a member
         ID name by which we will know you, choose a password and provide us an Email address. You use the
         member ID name and password to gain access to your information. We use your contact information to
         provide you with alerts, information, and updates, which is part of the Optimal Blue service. We may use
         your information, to send you communications and special offers on other products or services offered by
         Optimal Blue. If you do not want to receive this information you may opt-out through the links provided in
         our email communications.
GENERAL INFORMATION PRACTICES.
     •   Mandatory and Optional Information: We identify what information is required to fulfill your request. If
         you chose not to provide mandatory information, we will not be able to provide you the service you are
         requesting.
     •   E-mail Message Formatting: When sending you Email we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF,
         that allows us to (1) format messages that best align with your computer's capabilities, and (2) determine
         whether you've opened an HTML Email. When you click on a link within an Email message, you will first
         pass through our server, and then are redirected onto the Internet. We use this data on an aggregate level to
         evaluate response rates to our Email messages and to determine which links are most useful to our client
         base.
     •   Within the Optimal Blue Family: Within Optimal Blue, our parent company and other unaffiliated
         partners we may exchange customer information.
     •   Service Providers: In some cases, we will employ or use service providers such as consultants, temporary
         workers, and third party software developers, to complete a business process or provide a service on our
         behalf. For example, we may use service providers to enhance our website technology, deliver products, or


         to send Emails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable
         information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information
         for purposes other than to act on our behalf.
    •    Service Alerts and Critical Notices: Although we respect and honor the privacy preferences you have
         expressed, we may need to contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to
         use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such as bug alerts. We may also contact you to
         respond to your specific requests, to clarify the order information you provided to us, or to notify you of
         upcoming subscription expiration dates.
    •    Change of Control: Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale,
         merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of
         a business of Optimal Blue.
    •    Changes to Our Privacy Policy: If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or
         practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to the
         Optimal Blue website 30 days before they take effect.
    •    Legal Disclosures: In some cases we may disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such
         as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.
We employ industry recognized security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you
have provided to us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. All data sent to Optimal Blue is protected with
technology that enables encryption of your data using methods such as:
    •    Secure Socket Layer (SSL): The Optimal Blue Web server supports the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
         transaction protocol originally developed by Netscape and now largely accepted as an industry standard.
         The purpose of this encryption protocol is to keep confidential the information passed back and forth
         between a Web server and its users.
    •    128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption: Optimal Blue uses a minimum of 128-Bit Domestic Grade
         Strong Encryption and will increase this standard as commercially available enhancements become widely
         supported on the Internet.
We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site's servers from unauthorized access using
industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures
and practices. All employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices which include limiting
access to sensitive information to only those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password
protocols for all employees. In addition, a username, member ID name and password are required for you to use,
view or change application or interview information. We use both internal and external resources to review the
adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.

         website activity to improve our site offerings, to reconstruct activity from a session or by a user, for
         troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes. We may also use this data to provide you a more
         personalized website experience, assistance with technical support questions, and to send you special


         offers, product and service updates, or other promotional materials that are relevant and tailored to your
         interests.
         We give you the opportunity to control the use of your personal information for purposes other than to
         fulfill your request. For example, on occasion we may use your contact information to send you
         promotional communications about Optimal Blue products. If you do not wish to receive such
         communications, you may send an Email to support@optimalblue.com.
