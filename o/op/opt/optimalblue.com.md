THIRD-PARTY USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are
served by thirdparties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content
providers, and application providers. While we generally do not allow them to
collect personally identifiable tracking information from consumers, these third
parties may use cookies (alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other
tracking technologies) to collect information about you when you use our
website. The information they collect may be associated with your personal
information or they may collect information, including personal information,
about your online activities over time and across different websites and other
online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based
(behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be
used nor are we responsible for those third parties’ practices. If you have any
questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should
contact the responsible provider directly. We encourage you to visit the third
parties’ websites to learn about their privacy practices. For information about
how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers,
see Technology Practices section.
E-MAIL COMMUNICATION PRACTICES
Our Anti-Spam practices tolerate only permission-based E-mail. You may
choose to opt-out or select your E-mail preferences when you sign-up for our
E-mail lists. You always have the opportunity to opt-out or change preferences
by following a link in the footer of all nontransactional E-mail messages sent by
us via E-mail. In addition, anyone receiving E-mails from us on behalf of our
Customers always has the opportunity to opt-out of E-mail messages from such
Customer by using the opt-out link included in the link in the footer of the
message.
• E-mail Message Formatting: We may use your E-mail address or other
information we collect to contact you for administrative purposes such as
customer service or to send communications, including marketing or
promotional communications relating to our Services. When sending you E-mail
we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to (i) format
messages that best align with your computer's capabilities, and (ii) determine
whether you have opened an HTML E-mail. When you click on a link within an
E-mail message, you will first pass through our server, and then are redirected
onto the Internet. We use this data on an aggregate level to evaluate response
rates to our E-mail messages and to determine which links are most useful to our
client base. Generally, you have the ability to opt out of receiving promotional
communications as described below.


SECURITY PRACTICES
Optimal Blue has commercially reasonable industry standard physical,
administrative and technical measures in place to maintain the security,
confidentiality and integrity of the information gathered through the Optimal
Blue Website, and to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of such
information. For example, Optimal Blue generally uses Transport Layer Security
(TLS) and uses server authentication when you connect to the Optimal Blue
Services. While we take reasonable steps to protect information and data
against security breaches and unauthorized access, no data transmission over
the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot
guarantee or warrant the security of any information you send to us.
All data sent to Optimal Blue through its Website is reasonably protected with
technology that enables encryption of your data using methods such as:
• Secure Socket Layer (SSL): The Optimal Blue Web server supports the Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) transaction protocol. The purpose of this encryption protocol
is to keep confidential the information passed back and forth between a Web
server and its users.
• 128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption: Optimal Blue uses a minimum of
128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption and will increase this standard as
commercially available enhancements become widely supported on the
Internet.
