In general, profile information and/or user data is used to deliver services or information to Optimise clients.

All profile information and user data is retained only for as long as is required in order for it to be used for its intended purpose.

Optimise takes all reasonable measures to ensure that profile information and user data are stored as securely as possible and not lost, misused or altered.

Our infrastructure is hosted in an enterprise-level, highly secure data centre with UPS, fire detection and suppression systems with a sophisticated environment management system. Fortigate Firewalls at all our sites provide site to site VPN tunnels. Strong encryption & DH group, short keylife and the latest VPN technologies (PFS,replay detection) ensure the highest level of security. Access to profile information and user data is restricted to those members of staff who must use it in order to carry out their responsibilities. When clients, affiliates or users have been provided with a password that is intended to protect access to their profile or account information, it is their responsibility to keep that password confidential.

Data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.

Optimise will not pass data to any third party for any reason, subject to the following exceptions.

  * Optimise may disclose personal profile information to any law enforcement agency who requests it in connection with the commission of an offence, or to comply with applicable laws and lawful government and/or regulatory requests.
  * Optimise may share profile information and/or user data with third-party suppliers engaged with us to assist in the provision of services to  
Optimise clients. Optimise suppliers are carefully managed to ensure that they comply with all the terms of this privacy policy when storing or processing the data covered by it.
  * In the event of a corporate transaction such as the purchase or sale of a business or assets, Optimise may disclose aggregate information on users or affiliates to the purchaser or seller involved.



Both profile information and user data may be transferred between the subsidiary group companies of Optimise Media Group, or between subsidiary companies and the holding company, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985 or section 1519 of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable.
