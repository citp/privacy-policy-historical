# Optionetics

Options involve risk. Prior to buying or selling an option, an investor must receive a copy of [Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options](http://www.cboe.com/Resources/Intro.asp). Investors need a broker to trade options, and must meet suitability requirements. Past results are not necessarily indicative of future performance.

All examples are exclusive of commissions, interest and dividends. You should consult your tax consultant and read the Options Disclosure Document (ODD) prior to investing in options. You can obtain a copy of the ODD from Optionetics, or from the Options Clearing Corporation (1888-options), One North Wacker Drive, Suite 500, Chicago IL 60606.
