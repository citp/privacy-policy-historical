			<h1>OptionsHouse Privacy Statement</h1>
<hr>
We want to make sure you are aware of our <a href="https://www.optionshouse.com/docs/privacy-policy.pdf" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. This Privacy Statement and our Privacy Policy disclose privacy practices for OptionsHouse on <a href="http://www.optionshouse.com" target="_parent">www.optionshouse.com</a>.  <br><p></p>
<p><strong>Purpose of this Privacy Statement &amp; Policy</strong><br>
We share your concerns about your privacy, and we are committed to protecting your privacy online. This Privacy Statement and Policy describe the type of information that we collect, how we collect that information, and why we collect it. It also details how you can update and correct the information we collect from you, the choices that you have on our collection of your information, cookies, the security measures we take, and how we update our privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Information We Collect</strong><br>
We collect two types of information about our users: personally identifiable information and nonpersonally identifiable information.  </p>
<p><em>Personally Identifiable Information:</em> The term “personally identifiable information” refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you open an account with us, you provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an account application.  That application includes personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, employer, job title, and other personal information.  </p>
<p><em>Nonpersonally Identifiable Information:</em> The term “nonpersonally identifiable information” refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather that information based upon where you visit on our site in several ways.  We then compile that information and analyze it on a personal and aggregate basis. The information may include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you go to next, which browser you may be using, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and your location information.  A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the web.  An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the web. Networks like the web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet. </p>
<p><strong>How We Collect Information</strong><br>
We collect personally identifiable information when you voluntarily provide it to us.  You provide personally identifiable information to us when you open an account, send email messages, submit forms or transmit other information by telephone, email, or letter, submit information to deposit or withdraw funds, or place orders to buy or sell securities.  We may also collect information from you at other points on our site.  </p>
<p>We use third parties to gather our customers’ data from financial institutions. By using our service, you grant the third-party provider the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution according to terms of the third party’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>We, or our third party ad server and/or content server, may also collect certain nonpersonally identifiable information. We automatically collect IP addresses and website usage information from you when you visit our website. This information helps us evaluate how our users navigate and use our website. Our third party ad servers may also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon. </p>
<p><strong>How We Use the Information</strong><br>
We will primarily use your personally identifiable information to provide our services to you. We also use that information to enhance the operation of our site, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our site’s content, layout, and services. We may use personally identifiable information to deliver information to you and to contact you, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you. We may also use information you have provided online with information we have obtained through third party sources to enhance our ability to market products or services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>How We Release the Information</strong><br>
We do not sell your personally identifiable information to others. We do provide some of our services through contracts with affiliates, service providers, partners, and other third parties. We and our service partners use your personally identifiable information to operate our sites and deliver services. The use of your personally identifiable information by those service partners is governed by their own privacy policies. Those policies are not subject to our control. </p>
<p>We may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals when: </p>
<ul>
<li>to fulfill your requests for specific products and services;</li>
<li>to improve the design and content of our site;</li>
<li>to contact you about special offers, products or services that may be of interest to you;</li>
<li>to provide you with customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
OptionsHouse may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals when: </p>
<ul>
<li>we have your consent to share the information;</li>
<li>we utilize third party service providers to provide products, services or functions on our behalf and require these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. For example, we provide information to companies that prepare and mail account statements and transaction confirmations.</li>
<li>we have entered into a business relationship with a third party company or an individual whom we believe will conform with our Privacy Statement and Policy;</li>
<li>we need to protect our legal rights;</li>
<li>we comply with applicable laws to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities. These parties include government/regulatory organizations, such as the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as any of the securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations and states we are registered with, and to parties under court order or subpoena requests; and </li>
<li>in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of our business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregate information is information that we (or third party service providers on our behalf) collect about OptionsHouse website users on an anonymous basis. We may share aggregate demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties. </p>
<p><strong>How to Update &amp; Correct Your Information</strong><br>
We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the personally identifiable information that you provide to us.  You may change any of your personally identifiable information in your account online. You may also access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences by contacting us at (877) 598-3190 or <a href="mailto:customerservice@optionshouse.com" target="_blank">customerservice@optionshouse.com</a>. We encourage you to update your personally identifiable information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed, but, because we are legally required to keep this information, we cannot delete it.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices on Collection &amp; Use of Information</strong><br>
We may send you emails regarding our products or services. We may also send you information regarding others’ products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. In addition, our affiliates may send you emails regarding their products or services. If you do not want to receive such information, simply let us know by contacting (877) 598-3190 or <a href="mailto:customerservice@optionshouse.com" target="_blank">customerservice@optionshouse.com</a>. We can edit your account information to no longer receive such offers. The marketing emails we send to you or those from our affiliates will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe, which is usually located at the bottom of the email message.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
When you use our site, we will store cookies on your computer to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies can note that your browser was used to visit certain sites, pages, or advertisements on a certain date. Our cookies may store randomly assigned user identification numbers and the country where you are located. Cookies do not contain personal information about you (unless you knowingly provide it). You can regularly delete or decline our cookies if your browser permits. That may affect the interaction with the web server. </p>
<p>We may use an outside ad serving company to display advertisements on our site. As part of their service, they may place a separate cookie on your computer. That third party may collect and use information about you, which may include your IP address, browser type, the server your computer logged into, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular ad. We may allow others to place banner ads on our site in the same manner. </p>
<p><strong>Online Behavioral Advertising &amp; Tracking</strong><br>
We use online behavior advertising that is directed to you based, in part, on your browsing behavior on the internet.  The information that we collect may include the name of the pages that you have viewed, your IP address, the time of your visit, information about your device, and other identifiers. We do not share this information with third parties, but third parties may also track such information when you visit our website. “Do-Not-Track” signals may allow a user to active browser software to notify websites that they do not wish to be tracked. Given these signals have not yet been standardized, most websites, including our website, does not alter its behavior when such a signal is received.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong><br>
You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use our site. Our website is not targeted to those under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information from individuals who are under the age of 13. If you believe we have accidentally received information from a child under age 13, please contact us at (877) 598-3190 or <a href="mailto:customerservice@optionshouse.com" target="_blank">customerservice@optionshouse.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that meet or exceed industry standards to guard your personally identifiable information. The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our customers is of utmost concern to us. We protect your personally identifiable information in a number of different ways. Access by you to personally identifiable information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. Your password is encrypted. In addition, your personally identifiable information resides on a secure server to which only selected personnel and contractors have access. And, we encrypt your personally identifiable information to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing that information when it is transmitted from us or to us.<br>
You can also take steps to maximize your security online and to protect your confidential information. First and foremost, do not choose a trivial password and do not post your password on your computer. Do not use a public computer unless you can verify that it is not capturing key strokes and that you can erase all of your information from it once you have finished. Make sure you are using the latest version of your browser software and have downloaded all browser security patches.</p>
<p><strong>This Privacy Statement &amp; Policy Applies to OptionsHouse</strong><br>
This policy applies to <a href="http://www.optionshouse.com" target="_parent">www.optionshouse.com</a> and services offered on it. It does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals or other companies’ websites, even if those products or sites may be displayed on our website and even if our site is displayed on their website. </p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Statement &amp; Policy </strong><br>
We may change this policy at any time. We will post those changes to this website, and they may be effective immediately. We encourage you to refer back to this policy each time that you visit. Your use of OptionsHouse’s website after any changes have been posted will constitute your agreement to the modified Privacy Statement &amp; Policy. We may also send updates to our Privacy Statement &amp; Policy by issuing an email to the email address you have provided us. By using this website, you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid email address with us and to update us if that email address changes.</p>
