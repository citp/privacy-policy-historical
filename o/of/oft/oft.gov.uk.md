#### Information we collect from visitors

We collect several kinds of information from visitors to oft.gov.uk depending on the part of the site being visited: email addresses, site usage information and, in a few cases, personal details such as your name and postal details if you order publications.

**Comments and questions**  
If you send an enquiry by email to a specific contact on the OFT website it may not always be possible for the OFT to provide the information requested directly. In such circumstances we may pass your enquiry to another government department so that they can respond to your information request.

**Email alerts
