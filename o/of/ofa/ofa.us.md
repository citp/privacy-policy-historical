**Our Site may contain links to other websites.  For example, we link to ActBlue to enable donations through ActBlue for our benefit, or we may link to sites of other organizations with whom we partner.  Any personal information you provide on such linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these websites or any other sites that are linked to from the Site.  We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.

**Social Sharing Features  
**The Site may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Site with other media, and vice versa.  The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.  For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.
