Privacy Policy
<br>
<span class="includes-slash"></span>
</h2>
<p>We at Of a Kind know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting or using the ofakind.com website, and any other features, content, or any other services we offer from time to time by in connection therewith (collectively, the "Site"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</p>
<h3>I. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Site. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. This policy also does not apply to information you choose to disclose publicly on the Site (i.e., information which is viewable to other Site users), which will not be considered Personal Information.</p>
<h3>II. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES OF A KIND COLLECT?</h3>
<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>
<p>A. Personal Information You Provide to Us:</p>
<p>We receive and store any information you provide to us whether by e-mail, registering to receive e-mail newsletters, placing a product order, or otherwise through the Site. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, zip code, address, age, and/or phone number. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of certain features. We use the Personal Information you provide to enhance your experience with Of a Kind.</p>
<p>We use a third party service provider to process payment transactions. We do not collect, store or otherwise have access to credit card information. Our payment processor is presently Braintree; http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com. You should review their Security and Reliability policy (http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/security) and Privacy Policy (http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/privacy) to ensure that you are comfortable with their use and disclosure of your information.</p>
<p>B. Information Collected Automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you interact with our Site, we may automatically receive and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested.</li>
<li>“Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of certain Site features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer, when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</li>
<li>When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often customers use parts of the Site, so that we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, so that they can understand how often people use their services, visit their Of a Kind stores, and our Site, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</li>
</ul>
<p>C. E-mail Communications:</p>
<p>You may sign up to receive periodic emails from us. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by sending us an email at newsletter@ofakind.com.</p>
<h3>III. WILL OF A KIND SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h3>
<p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form only as described below.</p>
<p>A. Designers: To improve your experience with Of a Kind and provide you with unique merchandise, we may make available certain Personal Information to our design partners. Please be aware that our design partners have no right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing new and improved merchandise.</p>
<p>B. Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: In certain situations, businesses we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Site (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction.</p>
<p>C. Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
<p>D. Communication About the Website: If a user voluntarily provides Of a Kind with Personal Information in an email, we will use that Personal Information only to contact such user to respond to such user’s inquiry.</p>
<p>E. Promotional Offers: We may send offers to certain users on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please send us an email at newsletter@ofakind.com.</p>
<p>F. Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>
<p>G. Protection of Of a Kind and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Of a Kind, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>H. With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
<h3>IV. IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</h3>
<p>All credit card information is processed by Braintree. We believe that they appropriately protect your information but you should review their practices at http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com.</p>
<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
<p>The Site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.</p>
<h3>V. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can always opt not to disclose information to use, but keep in mind some information may be needed to take advantage of some of our features.</li>
<li>You may be able to add or update certain information by sending us an email or using other updating features of the Site. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please contact us at newsletter@ofakind.com. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Site, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VII. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Site or sending you an email. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Site after such changes have been first posted.</p>
<h3>VIII. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to info@ofakind.com. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
<p>Effective Date: November 15, 2010</p>
