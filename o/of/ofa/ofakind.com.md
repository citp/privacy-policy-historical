This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. This policy also does not apply to information you choose to disclose publicly on the Site (i.e., information which is viewable to other Site users), which will not be considered Personal Information.

### II. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES OF A KIND COLLECT?

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

A. Personal Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you provide to us whether by e-mail, registering to receive e-mail newsletters, placing a product order, or otherwise through the Site. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, zip code, address, age, and/or phone number. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of certain features. We use the Personal Information you provide to enhance your experience with Of a Kind.

We use a third party service provider to process payment transactions. We do not collect, store or otherwise have access to credit card information. Our payment processor is presently Braintree; http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com. You should review their Security and Reliability policy (http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/security) and Privacy Policy (http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/privacy) to ensure that you are comfortable with their use and disclosure of your information.

B. Information Collected Automatically:

  * Whenever you interact with our Site, we may automatically receive and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested.
  * “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of certain Site features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer, when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
  * When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often customers use parts of the Site, so that we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, so that they can understand how often people use their services, visit their Of a Kind stores, and our Site, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

B. Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: In certain situations, businesses we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Site (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction.
