  * make sure you know why we need it
  * only ask for what we need, and not to collect too much or irrelevant information
  * protect it and make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t
  * let you know if we share it with other organisations to give you better public services - and if you can say no
  * make sure we don’t keep it longer than necessary
  * not make your personal information available for commercial use without your permission.



To help us to keep your information reliable and up to date, please:

  * provide us with accurate information

## Site usage information

### Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.



You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through [Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/SiteInformation/DG_197506?CID=Central&PLA=url_mon&CRE=managing_cookies "Opens in a new window")
