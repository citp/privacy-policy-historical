### This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from you

This statement describes our privacy practices for the websites where it is posted. This includes mobile websites, text programs and applications. It also applies to information we collect in our stores or other places offline.

### We collect information from you in many ways 

**We collect information directly from you.** For example, if you register for a promotion or apply for a job. We might collect information if you post a comment on one of our websites or request information. We also collect information when you apply for our credit card or buy something. 

**We collect information from you passively.** We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons. To learn more about these tools and how you can control them, [click here](https://web.archive.org/specialLinks.do?file=/customerservice/trackingtools.jsp&template=customerService). 

**We get information about you from third parties.** For example, social media platforms may give us information about you. We may combine the information we collect from you with the information we get from third parties. 

### We collect various information about you

We may collect your name, email address, postal address, phone number, cell phone number, or credit card number, for example. We may ask you for information to learn more about you, like your age or products you like.

### We use information as disclosed and described here

**To respond to your requests or questions.** For example, we might use your information to register you for promotions. 

**To improve our products and services.** We might use your information to customize your experience with us. 

**To look at site trends and customer interests.** We may use your information to make website or product improvements. We may also combine information we get from you with information we have gotten from third parties. 

**For security purposes.** We may use information to protect our company, our customers, or our websites. 

**To promote us and our various websites.** Unless we tell you otherwise, we might notify you about special promotions or offers. We might tell you about new website features or products. To manage this, follow the instructions in Your Choices, below. 

**To communicate with you about your account or our relationship:** We may contact you to tell you about changes to this Policy or our website Terms. We may also tell you about issues with your orders. 

### We may share information with third parties

Your information may be shared when legally permitted, including in the following situations:

**Within our company (including our affiliated companies).**

**With third parties who perform services on our behalf.** For example, we share information with vendors, or will authorize them to collect information on our behalf. Some vendors may be located outside of the United States. 

**With our business partners.** To opt out of having your information shared, see Your Choices below. To stop receiving information from a business partner, follow their opt out instructions. 

**If we think we have to in order to comply with the law.** For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests. We may also share information to protect us, our sites, or our users. We might share information with other companies for fraud and credit risk reduction. 

**With any successor to all or part of our business.** For example, if part of our business was sold we may sell our customer list as part of that transaction. 

### Our websites may link to third party sites or services we don't control

If you click on one of those links, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This policy does not apply to the information practices of that website. You should read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. 

### We use standard security measures to protect your information

The Internet is not 100% secure. We thus cannot promise that your information will be completely safe. Please use caution when using the Internet or providing personal information to others.
