**How We Use Cookies**

A cookie is a file containing a specific identifier of letters and numbers that are sent by web servers to web browsers and is stored by the browser. This information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.

Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies will remain valid until they are deleted or reached their expiration date. A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire when the web browser is closed.

We may use cookies to track and analyze traffic browsing data for each user; this helps us understand your needs and identify which pages you find the most useful to enhance our services and website.

Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies even though they automatically accept them. You can edit your browser settings to block them, but this will impact the usability of some websites.
