### Personal Information

We respect the privacy of our customers, partners, employees, job applicants, and other visitors to our websites who may provide personal information. We recognize the need for appropriate protections and management of personal information that you provide to us. Our policy is pretty simple, we do not share your personal information with anyone without your permission. 

OfficeTIMELINE only collects personal information when you contact us or provide feedback and only uses the information collected to provide those services for you. If you choose to make a purchase, you will be asked to provide contact information (such as your name and shipping address) and financial information (such as your credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to process your order. Credit card information is not stored in any shape or form by OfficeTIMELINE - some information may be stored by Authorize.net, our credit card processing merchant for compliance purposes. OfficeTIMELINE handles all of this data with the utmost confidentiality.

### Third Parties

Any personal information provided will not be traded, rented, sold or otherwise shared with anyone outside of OfficeTIMELINE or used for reasons beyond those contemplated in this statement. From time to time, we may engage third parties to process your information on our behalf; however, none of OfficeTIMELINE affiliates (such as our credit card company) have permission to retain, share, store or use personal information for any reason other than providing the requested service. 

### Security

To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure and improper use of your information, we have established appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect in accordance with our privacy policy. 

### Changes to This Statement

OfficeTIMELINE will update this Statement periodically.
