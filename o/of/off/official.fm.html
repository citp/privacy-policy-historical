Official.fm requires your true name and identifying information for registration via the Website. In instances where Official.fm does not require your true name or any identifying information, you agree not to choose a name that misleads or misidentifies you as another person, Official.fm or is confusingly similar to any products, services, trademarks or is indecent or otherwise offensive. If you choose to use your own name as your screen name, you consent to it being passed to others by certain functionality and uses of the Website. </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Protection of Minors</h2>

      <hr>

      <h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

      <p>PII is information that identifies you or can be used to identify, contact, or locate you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name (i.e., first name or initial and last name), home or business address, email address, telephone number, and debit or credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification value, or billing address. </p>

      <p>Official.fm respects your privacy. We only collect PII through optional, voluntary submissions, such as email, survey information, and online registration forms. The types and amount of personal information collected from these activities will vary depending on the activity, but in no event will we collect PII that is not voluntarily given by you. Official.fm may use PII to facilitate requests, to contact you if a problem arises or for other uses consistent with this statement and your requests.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

      <p>Official.fm collects statistical data about your use and third parties’ use of the Website and interest in the Content provided on the Website using Cookies, as described below.  This data does not identify you personally and is purely statistical data, such as the date a Viewer views Content, length of viewing, where Content is embedded, where the Viewer is geo-located and other similar anonymous data.  This Non-PII helps Official.fm maintain, administer and monitor the Website in order to analyze trends, improve the overall quality of the Website, enhance Official.fm’s services, tailor the Website to your needs and respond to your inquiries. Such analysis and information is aggregated across users, does not identify anyone as an individual and does not link to any personally identifiable information. Besides posting these statistics for you and other fans to enjoy, Official.fm may publish or share this statistical information in the aggregate with other companies.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Sharing with Third Parties</h2>

      <p>Official.fm may partner with other third parties to provide specific services.  When you sign up for such services, Official.fm may share names or other PII as necessary in order for the third party to provide such services. From time to time, Official.fm may need to share such PII with other trusted third parties who perform certain services and functions on Official.fm’s behalf (such as maintenance and support for the Website).  These parties only have access to the PII they need in order to perform their functions.  Official.fm may also share your personal information with users of the Website at your request, for example, you may be asked to provide your email address in exchange for a free download of song.  Except as outlined in this statement or on the Website, Official.fm does not provide your PII to third parties without your consent.</p>

      <p>Official.fm may share non-PII in the aggregate with you and other fans to enjoy, and may publish or share this statistical information in the aggregate with other companies.</p>

      <p><strong>Official.fm’s Privacy Statement does not apply to, and we cannot fully control how, third parties use your information.  Accordingly, we cannot be held responsible for third parties’ use of your PII or Non-PII.  </strong></p>

      <p>Should Official.fm merge with or be acquired by another company, or if the business unit providing your service were sold to another company, any information collected may be transferred to and used by the resulting combined company. If Official.fm were to cease operations, this customer data might be transferred to and used by another company, which offers similar or related products or services. While we cannot predict a great deal about such an unlikely event, we would hope this would provide you with continuity of service.</p>
