      <p>Your privacy is very important to us, and we will treat your data with care and respect. We know that you care how information and data about you is collected, used and shared.  This Privacy Statement describes our privacy policy and details how we collect, use, and/or disseminate the information you provide. We reserve the right change this Statement at any time and urge you to review our Statement regularly to familiarize yourself with any changes.
      </p><p><strong>
        By visiting our website, using our online products/services, and/or by voluntarily submitting information to us via online forms, advertisement responses, and/or electronic mail, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement.
      </strong>
      </p><p><strong>Who We Are</strong><br>
      OfficeVP, LLC. has developed and licenses a system software product called OfficeF5 which allows Independent Marketing Agents to promote a legal and ethical network marketing opportunity and/or Client program and/or opportunities or programs and/or products of their choice.  The OfficeF5  is designed to be used exclusively to promote the products and Services offered by the system. However, due to the fact that each OfficeF5 account is controlled by an independent representative, we cannot guarantee how the system and privacy information will be managed by these representatives.</p>
    <p>OfficeVP, LLC. operates and manages the OfficeF5 strictly as a back-bone technology provider. Individuals that subscribe to the OfficeF5 do so in one of two forms: prospects (sometimes referred to as Pre-Enrollees), and Members. Individual subscriptions to the OfficeF5 are referred to as a "Member" in the OfficeF5.</p>
    <p>To cater to both you (the Customer) and our Members, we may be required to collect, use, and share certain information.  The type of information we collect, together with a description of how we use and/or share it, is described below. </p>
    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use<br>
    </strong>Your personal information (and your customer information) will be kept strictly confidential. It is never sold, given away, or shared with anyone, unless we're required to by law. </p>
    <p>Your recipient lists are stored on the OfficeF5 server. We do not, under any circumstances, steal your list, sell your list, or share it with any other party, unless required to by law. Your recipient list is kept strictly confidential. </p>
    <p>Only carefully selected, authorized personnel have access (for customer service and abuse-monitoring purposes) to view system accounts and campaigns. </p>

    <p><strong>Security</strong> <br>
      We take every precaution to protect the   confidentiality and security of your personal information by using   industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with   carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss,   misuse or unauthorized alteration. When we ask for sensitive information, such   as credit card numbers, we protect it through the use of encryption during   transmission, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
