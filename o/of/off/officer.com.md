LAST UPDATED: May 30, 2018

Endeavor Business Media, LLC, its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively  
“Endeavor Business Media” or “we”) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information  
provided to us by those who use our products and services. Our goal is to provide you with an experience  
that delivers the information, resources and services that are helpful to you. In order to achieve this  
goal, we may collect information from you. This policy describes how personally identifiable and anonymous  
information about our publication subscribers, online media product users and event registrants may be  
collected and shared.

Please be sure to read this Privacy Policy before using any Endeavor Business Media  
Web Site or submitting information through a Site. By using any of our Web Sites, you consent to our use of  
your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy and accept the terms and conditions herein.

This Privacy Policy is current as of the date written above. If we change our  
privacy practices, we will also update this Privacy Policy. Users should review this policy periodically to  
monitor any changes. Your continued use of our sites and services constitutes your acceptance of this  
entire Privacy Policy, as updated from time to time. Endeavor Business Media reserves the right to access  
and disclose personally identifiable information as necessary to comply with applicable laws, lawful  
government requests and any orders of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  


## How does Endeavor Business Media collect your information?

Endeavor Business Media uses cookies and other internet technologies in the  
management of our Web Site and email programs in an effort to enrich your online experience. We may also  
use IP addresses to gather broad geographic information for aggregate use. Our cookies do not contain any  
information that is personally identifiable. Like many Web Sites, Endeavor Business Media may use pixel  
tags, also known as web beacons, clear gifs, or web bugs. Pixel tags help us improve our understanding of  
our web traffic and visitor behavior, as well as gauge the response to our promotional efforts. If you  
wish, you may disable pixel tags by setting your browser to omit images and disable JavaScript.

We use industry-standard, third party advertising service companies to serve  
advertisements when you visit our Sites or open our emails. These companies may use cookies, pixel tags,  
and other methods to collect information about your visit to our Web Site, and others, in order to provide  
you with relevant advertisements about products, services, and events. These collection methods do not  
typically include your name, address, or telephone number. These elements also provide us with aggregate  
pictures of traffic patterns, which help us to improve your site experience and monitor advertising effort

  


## When is personally identifiable information collected? How is  
your information used?

Endeavor Business Media collects personally identifiable information that you choose  
to provide us when you subscribe to our magazines, sign up for e-newsletters, enter a contest, participate  
in surveys, login into our Web Sites using a third party login system (including, but not limited to,  
Facebook Connect, Twitter, etc.), register for a Web Site, webcast, or trade show, or otherwise communicate  
with us. When you provide this information to us, you are no longer anonymous. Endeavor Business Media does  
not take any steps to protect the privacy of information you volunteer about yourself in public forums or  
other publicly accessible sections of our Web Sites.

  


We may use your contact information to send notices for subscription renewal or  
provide you with information about products or services you have ordered with us. We may also use your  
contact information to send you e-newsletters or other promotional e-mails that contain targeted, relevant  
content that may be useful to your business. All promotional e-mails you receive from us will include an  
option to opt out of similar e-mail communications in the future.

  


We may include personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be  
uniquely identified with you) such as your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address, as  
well as “demographic” information such as the type of business you work for, your job responsibilities and  
certain information about your company. We will tell you at the time we collect information whether the  
information requested is necessary for you to participate in a particular feature. The information we  
collect is used to respond to your specific requests, to send you periodic information and special offers  
from Endeavor Business Media and our sponsors, to provide you with updates on Endeavor Business Media  
offerings and features, to provide you with product information from manufacturers in our database, and to  
provide our sponsors and business partners with data about our users. 

  


We may disclose aggregated information about users and information that does not  
identify any individual, without restriction. We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal  
Information if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the  
information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or  
advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the  
public. In the unlikely event that all of Endeavor Business Media’s assets or substantially all of its  
assets are acquired, then customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one of the  
transferred assets.

  
  


## How does Endeavor Business Media secure and store your  
information?

We use reasonable precautions, including appropriate technical, administrative, and  
physical procedures, to try to protect collected personal information from loss, misuse, or alteration.

Many of our Web Sites contain links to Web Sites owned and operated by unaffiliated  
third parties. These links are provided as a service to you, and do not constitute Endeavor Business  
Media's endorsement or support of those third parties or their Web Sites. Each third party Web Site has its  
own information collection and use practices, and we advise you to review their policies.

Endeavor Business Media is not responsible or liable for third party privacy  
practices or the content of third party sites. We are not responsible or liable for any breach of security  
or for the actions of these parties.

Due to the design of the Internet and other factors outside our control, we cannot  
guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third  
parties. Any information you provide may be stored and maintained in a Endeavor Business Media database,  
either housed at Endeavor Business Media or with a third party vendor. In the case of a sale, change of  
ownership or merger involving Endeavor Business Media or any parent, subsidiary or affiliated company, your  
information may be transferred to a third party.

  


Passwords may be used by a Site to protect your personal data. We recommend that you  
do not share your passwords with anyone, and notify us promptly if you believe your password security has  
been breached. Endeavor Business Media will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or  
in an unsolicited e-mail. Also, if you are using a computer that others have access to, such as one in a  
computer lab, Internet cafe or public library, always remember to log out and close your browser window  
when leaving any of our Sites. In addition, any personally identifiable information or sensitive data that  
you disclose through any discussion boards or other public online forums hosted on the Sites may be  
collected and used by others. We recommend caution when giving out personal information to others in these  
public online forums. When you provide information on these forums, you do so at your own risk. The  
information you share may be viewed by any other user of the Sites.

  


We will retain your personal information and any information collected from your  
use of our Web Sites for as long as you are a Subscriber or otherwise maintain a user account on our Web  
Sites and for a reasonable time thereafter.

  
  
  


## What options do you have about how Endeavor Business Media uses  
or shares your information?

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal  
information you provide us. To exercise control over your information, we have provided you with the  
following mechanisms:

If you no longer wish for us to share your mailing address or  
other contact information with our sponsors or other third parties, you may adjust your account preferences  
or you can send us an e-mail at [donotdisclose@endeavorb2b.com](mailto:donotdisclose@endeavorb2b.com). For us to be able to locate your record, your e-mail must include your name, mailing address,  
e-mail address, and must identify the Endeavor Business Media product, event, or service for which you are  
registered. We will strive to process your request within 10 days, and thereafter we will no longer share  
your contact information with third parties. Please note that we will not be able to stop third parties  
from sending you information about their products or services if your information was shared with them  
before we received your request. 

Regarding e-mail specifically, you have the opportunity to  
elect to stop receiving advertising messages from Endeavor Business Media about our products or services  
each time you receive such a communication from us. To unsubscribe from such advertising e-mail messages,  
please follow the directions included in that e-mail message. We will endeavor to process your request  
within 10 days. Please note that during that time, you may continue to receive e-mail messages from  
Endeavor Business Media about its products or services. Additionally, regardless of whether you have  
unsubscribed from receiving advertising and promotional material from Endeavor Business Media, you will  
continue to receive transactional information from us, such as information relating to your account or  
payment or bill information. If you receive broadcast e-mail messages that we may send about third party  
manufacturers in whose products or services we believe you may be interested, and no longer wish to receive  
such messages, you can do so by following the directions included in the e-mail message you receive. If you  
have further questions regarding your options with respect to your account information, please contact us  
at the e-mail or mailing address included at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.

  
  


## Your Consent

By using our Web Sites, you are consenting to our processing of your information as  
set forth in this Privacy Policy. “Processing” means using cookies on a computer or hand held device or  
using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting,  
using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States.  
If you reside outside the United States your information will be transferred, processed and stored there  
under United States privacy standards.

  


## How Can I Access, Correct, or Amend Information About Me?

We want to assure you that you have access to your Personal Information that we  
collect and store. Customers may correct or amend information that is inaccurate by reviewing and updating  
your account preferences or by contacting us by email at [DPO@Endeavorb2b.com](mailto:DPO@Endeavorb2b.com) or by mail at Endeavor Business Media, Attention: Data Privacy Officer, 1233 Janesville  
Avenue, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin 53538.

  


## Collection and Use of Information from Children

Our Web Sites are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age  
13 may provide any personal information to or on the Website. We do not knowingly collect personal  
information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this  
Website or on or through any of its features. If we learn we have collected or received personal  
information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that  
information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please send an  
email to: [DPO@Endeavorb2b.com](mailto:DPO@Endeavorb2b.com). You may also call 800-547-7377 and ask for the Data Privacy Officer, or mail your request to  
the attention of the Data Privacy Officer at 1233 Janesville Ave, Fort Atkinson, WI 53538.

  


## Regarding SSL

  


Our Site uses ‘SSL’ to protect personal information. By using a  
browser that supports security functions, when you access to our Site and enter personal information  
including your name and e-mail address, and this information is transferred to our server, the information  
is automatically encrypted when transmitted and received by servers. Therefore if the transmitted data is  
intercepted by a third party, there is no need to worry about the content being stolen.

If you use a  
browser that does not support SSL, you may not be able to access our Site or input information.

  
  


## Do Not Track Signals 

Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to  
operators of Web Sites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that  
you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different  
Web Sites. Our Web Sites do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect  
information about your online activity while you are using our Web Sites.

  


## California Privacy Rights   


California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 allows California residents to request  
certain information regarding disclosure of information to our affiliates and third parties for direct  
marketing purposes and providing contact information for any such affiliates and third parties. As outlined  
in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable information with any affiliate or third  
party for direct marketing purposes without your prior approval. If you are a California resident and would  
like us to confirm in writing that we have not provided any of your Personal Information (as defined in the  
California Civil Code Sections referenced immediately above) during your use of the Web Sites to any
