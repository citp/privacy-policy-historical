The reason why we receive User Information is to enable us to provide services through our website to our end users. Such information would contain inter alia information that enable us to identify our clients and be able to transact with them pursuant to applicable laws such as information pertaining to age which enables us to determine the capacity of our client to enter into a legally binding agreement, information required to enable our users to access our website repeatedly such as the user name and password as well as the email address which is used to manage the user account, especially, in those cases of forgotten log in names and passwords, information to enable us to transact with the client such as the preferred payment method, information required to provide the services to our clients such as the email address, physical address, mobile number which are used to send vouchers, billing and collection.
