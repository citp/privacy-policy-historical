                  <div class="newsListing">
                  	<div class="news">Our  Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the  highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in  dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy encompasses many of the internet's standards and is designed to assist you in  understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you  provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our  site and our products and services. This statement will be continuously assessed  against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</div>
                  	<div class="title">What Information Do We Collect?</div>
                    <div class="news">When  you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information:  personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an  individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis  as you and others browse our Web site.</div>
                  	<div style="margin-left:20px;">
                      <div class="title">1.  Personal Information You Choose to Provide</div>
                        <div class="news">If you choose  to correspond further with us through e-mail, we may retain the content of your  e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and our responses. We provide  the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the  maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</div>
                        <div class="title">2.  Web Site Use Information</div>
                        <div class="news">Similar  to other Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology  called "cookies" (see explanation below, "<a href="#cookies">What Are  Cookies?</a>") and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web  site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may  include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web  site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This  information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is  associated with you as an individual.</div>
                    </div>
                  	<div class="title">How  Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</div>
                    <div class="news">Broadly  speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our  business activities, providing customer service and making available other  products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally,  we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important  changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find  valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed  and managed under our traditional standards designed to safeguard the  security and privacy of our customers' personal information. As a customer, you  will be given the opportunity, at least once annually, to notify us of your  desire not to receive these offers.</div>
                  	<div class="title"><a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a>What  Are Cookies?</div>
                    <div class="news">Cookies  are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the  computer used to access a Web site. They are small pieces of data that are  stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember  what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent  interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to  streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier  for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial  transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience  easier and more personalized.</div>
                  	<div class="title">How  Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</div>
                    <div class="news">Aside from being used to maintain your online sessions (i.e. forum posting, account management, commenting), we  use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to  gather information about our Web site users' browsing activities in order to  constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. This  information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly  manner and to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our  customers and prospective customers.</div>
                  	<div class="news">Cookies  help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in  the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site as they  move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many  people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity. We do  not use these technologies to capture your individual e-mail address or any  personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send  focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.</div>
                    <div class="title">Sharing  Information with Affiliates</div>
                    <div class="news">From  time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on our Web  site. We take measures to select product or service providers that are  responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. However, we  cannot make any representations about the practices and policies of these  companies.</div>
                  	<div class="title">Sharing  Information with Strategic Partners</div>
                    <div class="news">We  may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third parties  who may be given access to personal information including your name, address,  telephone number and e-mail for the purpose of providing you information  regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In  connection with strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will retain  all ownership rights to the information, and we will not share information regarding  your social security number or other personal financial data that we may have.</div>
                  	<div class="title">Notice  of New Services and Changes</div>
                    <div class="news">Occasionally,  we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important  changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find  valuable. As our client, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your  desire not to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you  receive such an offer, updating your mailing preferences in your account, or by sending us an e-mail request from our <a href="/contact.php">contact page</a>.</div>
                  	<div class="title">How  Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</div>
                    <div class="news">E-mail that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that  security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information.  For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as  Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured e-mail.</div>
                  	<div class="title">Do  We Disclose Information to Outside Parties?</div>
                    <div class="news">We  may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, Web site traffic  patterns and related Web site information to our affiliates or reputable third  parties, but this information will not include personally identifying data,  except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</div>
                    <div class="title">What  About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</div>
                    <div class="news">We  may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when  we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of  our legal rights.</div>
                    <div class="title">What  About Other Web Sites Linked to or from Our Web Site?</div>
                    <div class="news">We  are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from  our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to  other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that  may be useful to the users of our Web site.</div>
                    <div class="news">Please  remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site,  our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any  other Web site, including Web sites which have a link to our Web site, is  subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules  and policies before proceeding.</div>
                    <div class="title">Your  Consent</div>
                    <div class="news">By  using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal  information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy  policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you  aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what  circumstances we may disclose it.</div>
