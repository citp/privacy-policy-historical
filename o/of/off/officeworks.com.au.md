# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

  1. This Privacy Policy is the official privacy policy of Officeworks Ltd and its subsidiaries and other related bodies corporate (“ **Officeworks** ”). It applies to all personal information collected by Officeworks, including via [www.officeworks.com.au](http://www.officeworks.com.au/) and any related Officeworks website, social media page, internal website or intranet (each a **Website** ); any Officeworks mobile or tablet application (each an **Application** ); and from an individual via any other means, including physically or electronically (together, the **Collection Channels** ).
  2. In this policy we explain how and why we collect your personal information, how we use it and disclose it, and what controls you have over our use of it. We appreciate that you may have certain concerns about how your personal information is collected, used and shared. We can assure you that we will always handle your personal information securely and carefully. Among other things, we comply with all applicable Australian privacy laws including the Australian Privacy Principles.
  3. In addition to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, there may also be specific and additional privacy and consent provisions that apply to certain Collection Channels. Because those specific and additional provisions also relate to your privacy protection, we recommend that you review them wherever they appear. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and those other specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail.



## Anonymity and Pseudonymity

  4. You have the option of dealing with Officeworks anonymously. However, this only applies where it is practicable for Officeworks to deal with you acting anonymously or under a pseudonym, such as a general enquiry.



## Collection of Information

  5. Throughout this privacy policy we refer to “personal information”, which means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not. Your first and last name, date of birth, gender, home address, contact telephone number, mobile telephone number, email address and employment details are examples of information which may constitute personal information. Personal information may also include information we may collect about your individual preferences.
  6. Some information provided to us by customers, contractors and other third parties might be considered to be personal information. We will only collect such personal information if it is necessary for one of our functions or activities. The kinds of personal information that Officeworks collects are set out below.

## How Officeworks collects, uses and discloses personal information

  11. At or before the time the personal information is collected by us via a particular Collection Channel, we will take reasonable steps to provide you with a collection statement to ensure that you are made aware of who we are, the fact that you are able to gain access to the information held about you, the purpose of the collection, the type(s) of organisations to which we usually disclose the information collected about you, any laws requiring the collection of the information and the main consequences for you if all or part of the information is not collected. We will not collect or monitor any personal information about you without your consent, included as provided in this privacy policy.



### Active information collection

  12. In particular, Officeworks will collect your personal information from you in the following situations:
    1. If you contact Officeworks, we may keep a record of that correspondence;
    2. When you participate in any offers, promotions or marketing activities.
    3. When you apply for and/or establish and/or access an account or order a product;
    4. When you conduct certain types of transactions such as cheque purchases or refunds;
    5. When you submit your e-mail address via a Website or Application or provide us with personal information via any medium, including a Website or Application;

    7. When you interact with a Website or Application for a specific purpose; and
    8. When you use or browse a Website or Application generally.



### Cookies and Passive Information Collection

  13. As you navigate through our Websites and access our Applications, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, and clickstream data). For example, we may collect information about matters including but not limited to the date, time and duration of visits and which pages of a Website or Application are most commonly accessed. This information is generally not linked to the identity of visitors, except where a Website or Application is accessed via links in an email or another electronic message we have sent or where we are able to uniquely identify the device or user accessing a Website or Application, such as when you are logged into an account.
  14. We may combine your anonymous or personal visitor session information or other information collected through tracking technologies with other personal information collected from you from time to time via our Collection Channels, in order to understand and measure your online experiences and to determine what products, promotions and services are likely to be of interest to you. By accessing a Website or Application via links in an email we have sent and/or by accessing a Website or Application where you have identified yourself, you consent to the collection of such information where it is personal information.



### Platform and Browser Permissions

  15. You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser.
  16. Mobile platforms such as iOS and Android generally define certain types of information or data that applications cannot access without your consent. Each platform has its own permissions system for obtaining your consent. For example, the iOS platform generally alerts you the first time an Officeworks Application wants permission to access certain types of data, such as location services, and will let you choose whether or not to consent to that request. Android devices will generally notify you of the permissions that an Officeworks Application seeks before you first use the Application, and your use of the Application constitutes your consent. For iOS devices, you can generally manage your platform level permissions via the Settings section on your device. For Android devices, you can generally manage your platform level permissions.



## Use of information collected and disclosure of personal information to others

  17. We collect such personal information so that we can provide you with a great service.
