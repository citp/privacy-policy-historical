<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
The following Privacy Policy governs the online information
collection practices of this website (the "Site"). Specifically,
it outlines the types of information that OfficeSpace.com, Inc.
("OSI", "we" or "us") gathers about you while you are using the
Site and the ways in which this information is used or shared.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting the Site,
you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Because the Internet is an evolving medium, we may need to change
our Privacy Policy at some point in the future. We reserve the
right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please
review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy,
we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our
home page so that you are aware of what information we collect,
how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose
it.
</p>
<p>
By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you
accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
</p>
<h2>
What Information is Collected About Visitors?
</h2>
<p>
The information that is collected about you while you are using
the Site falls into two general categories:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>
Information You Provide to Us.
</span>
<p>
The Site may collect and store information, personal or otherwise,
that you voluntarily supply while on the Site. For example, we
collect personal information such as your name, address, phone
number, email address, and other information relevant to
particular products or services that you choose to enter into one
of the Site's forms. If you decline to supply or provide the Site
with certain information while using the Site, you may not be able
to use or participate in some or all of the features offered
through the Site.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<span>
Information that is Automatically Collected.
</span>
<p>
The Site also collects and stores information that is generated
automatically as you navigate through the Site and use the Site.
For example, to enhance your experience on the Site, the Site uses
a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie."
Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard
drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when
visitors use the Site, cookies help us track user trends and
patterns. Other examples of information that the Site may collect
as you navigate it include, but are not limited to, date and time
of visit, referring URL address (location from which a visitor
comes to the Site), type of Internet browser, and visitor's IP
address. This information allows us, among other things, to
improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure
traffic on the Site.
</p>
<p>
Cookie data is linked to personally identifiable information for
the purposes of data analysis and quality control. However, data
from individual cookies will never be shared with or sold to third
parties without your permission.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<span>
Merging of Information.
</span>
<p>
Information collected through the Site may be merged with
information collected from other sources, including offline
sources. Similarly, information collected through the Site may be
stored with information collected from other sources, including
offline sources.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>With Whom Will Your Information Be Shared?</h2>
<p>
We may share information about you with other people or
unaffiliated companies or for various purposes including, without
limitation, the purposes described below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Products or Site Requests: If you submit a request for
information about a product or service on the Site, we
will share information about you contained in the
request form with third-parties regarding whose products
or services you seek information. Alternatively, we may
directly fulfill your request for the information you
seek. Third parties who provide products or services
regarding which you seek information may contact you by
telephone, e-mail, or postal mail based on the
information you provided, even if you have opted into
the National Do Not Call List administered by the
Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not
Call List, or the Do Not Call List of a specific
company. If one of our business partners contacts you
and you wish not to be contacted again by that business
partner with respect to your inquiry, then you should
specifically make a request to that partner not to
contact you again. In some cases, a third party may be
involved in the process - for example, the Site may
share your information with a third party who will
fulfill your request on behalf of the third party
regarding whose products or services you seek
information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Site Providers: We may disclose information about you to
companies that provide certain services on behalf of the
Site, such as marketing or distribution services. Our
service providers use the information received via the
Site for the purposes of providing you with the products
or services you requested and may provide information
regarding other products in which you may be interested.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Related Companies: We may share information about you
with subsidiaries, parent companies, entities otherwise
controlled by us, with successors and assigns, or in
connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially
all of our assets or equity.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Marketing Partners: We may also share information with
marketing partners who may provide information (on their
own behalf or on behalf of third parties) regarding
products or services which may be of interest to you.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Data Providers: If you have submitted or given us permission
to display your listing(s), we will allow tenants who are
interested in your listing(s) to contact you.  You may also
receive emails from other commercial real estate companies
regarding new requirements they are seeking which you may
opt-out of should you no longer wish to receive these emails.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Required by Law: We reserve the right to disclose your
personally identifiable information as required by law
and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to
protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial
proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our
Web site. In addition to the information that you
provide to us or that we obtain about you, we may
augment the data we collect with other information from
other online or offline sources. Moreover, we reserve
the right to store information we collect from you in
connection with other online or offline information we
may possess or obtain about you.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and
organizational measures designed to secure your personal
information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access,
use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those
measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
Our Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do
not knowingly publish information for anyone under the age of 13
through our Services. If you know of anyone under the age of 13
whose information is published through our Services, or have other
concerns about children's privacy, please contact us at
feedback@officespace.com.
</p>
<h2>Cookies and Similar Tracking Mechanisms</h2>
<p>
From time to time we employ the services of a third party agent to
track and analyze aggregated statistical data about the site.
These third parties, our partners and advertisers may set cookies
and web beacons on the site. A web beacon is a one by one pixel
image embedded within a web page or email to monitor individual
page traffic.
