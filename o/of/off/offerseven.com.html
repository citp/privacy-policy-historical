          <h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>

          <p>
            We may use third party (processor, contractor, affiliate, partner, contractors, suppliers, vendors etc.) to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include, but are not limited to: data storage services, database maintenance services, and payment processing. When we use such third party to perform services on our behalf, we will only provide them with access to Personal Data that they need to perform their specific function. We will make sure that each third party will be required by contract to keep such Personal Data confidential, make necessary steps to protect such Personal Data and not to use it for any purpose other than providing services to us and other provisions as required by law and Regulation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before transferring any Personal Data to third party (processor, contractor, affiliate, partner, contractors, suppliers, vendors etc.) we shall make reasonable check of such third party regarding its compliance with law and Regulation. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to store Personal Data of individuals in the regions where they live or operate in cases if we are required by law or Regulation to do so (e.g. Personal Data of EU citizens in EU or countries acknowledged by relevant authority as having appropriate level of data protection). If storing of Personal Data in such way is not commercially reasonable, we will ensure that third party processors are bound by agreement which contains obligations of the processor to provide at least minimum necessary level of security and other provisions as required by law or Regulation (e.g. as required by approved model data processing agreements adopted by relevant data protection authority). As well, we will ensure that such agreement contains obligation of processor to adopt necessary provisions into his agreements with sub-processors (if any). Herein you give us your free unambiguous consent to store your Personal Data (and Non-Personal Data, if applicable) outside of your country of residence (registration, domicile, center of vital interests, economic region, etc.).
          </p>

          <p>
            We may disclose Personal Data if required to do so by law (Regulation) or to comply with a legal obligation, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (i) protect our rights or property and our customers or (ii) protect the property or safety of users of the Site or the Software and the accompanying services, legal owners of the Site or the Software; or any third party. If we will be required by law to disclose any of your Personal Data, we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of that disclosure requirement, unless we are prohibited from doing so by statute, court or administrative order.
          </p>

          <p>
            We reserve the right to sell, assign or transfer our business or assets. In any such event or similar event, including but not limiting to a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, etc., Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer or successor of ours may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
