The data that you provide to Marketing Punch is held by both Marketing Punch and the sponsors of the questionnaires that you answer. Marketing Punch holds your data in a central database and this database is only accessed by reference to interest or demographic categories in order to provide you with information about those interests you have selected. The process of supplying you with this information is at all times under the control of Marketing Punch although specialist third party suppliers may carry out the dispatch.

Marketing Punch has all reasonable precautions possible in place to ensure data is kept and processed fairly. Marketing Punch is not responsible for any loss or damage you or others may suffer as a result of the loss of confidentiality of such information. 

##  Sponsored Questionnaires and Co-branded sites

You give your consent that Marketing Punch or any third party it provides data to may contact you by post or telephone. Where your telephone number is not provided, Marketing Punch or a third party may seek to append your telephone number from a third party source. 

Your data may be provided to clients of Marketing Punch to be appended to information they already hold about you for the purpose of contacting you with information about their products and services. When first contacting you these clients will seek your appropriate consent. 

Marketing Punch may from time to time use third party suppliers to provide all or part of a service to you. Marketing Punch will only supply such of your personal information as is necessary to enable them to provide the relevant service to you. 

You should be aware that such outside service providers might be based in countries outside the European Union whose laws provide for a different standard of protection for your personal data than that provided under English law. In such circumstance Marketing Punch will have in place contractual arrangements which will require your data to be processed at least to a standard compliant with the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Except as provided above, Marketing Punch will not provide your personal information to any third party without your prior consent, however, under certain circumstances the force of law may require the provision of information to the legal authorities. In order to maintain the integrity of its website and safeguard the interests of its subscribers Marketing Punch will comply with any such legally binding request.
