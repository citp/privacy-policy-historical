## Our Purpose for Processing Your Personal Data

Advertising will be sent by these named third party companies, subject to explicit, active consent by the registered individual prior to signing up or registering to our websites. 

We will only minimize the data and process only where it is adequate relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes stated above, in accordance with Art. 5 (1), (c) of the GDPR); 

## Our Legitimization for Processing Your Personal Data

7\. Our legitimate interest basis for obtaining and processing of your data is to: 

7.1.manage your (as the registered individual) participation in our draws, promotions and/or device testing campaigns on our owned sites – such as maintaining your registration to our site; 

7.2. improve and personalise our site to you, and this could be where we may market directly to you, about other relevant offers that may be of interest to you; 

7.3. determine whether any of our trusted Partners we work with may have services, products and offers that may be of interest to you based on your preferences; and 

7.4. where appropriate, relevant (and with consent) communicate your data to our trusted Partners. You may object to this processing at any time by emailing us: [datacompliance@marketingpunch.co.uk](mailto:datacompliance@marketingpunch.co.uk)

## Collection and Use of Your personal data

8\. We collect your details when you register or visit on one of our websites; subscribe to our service; correspond with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. ‘personal data’ or ‘personal data’ means the information you provide during the registration process and any information you provide when entering prize draws, quizzes, surveys or competitions. Registration is required to participate in any of the branded surveys on the site, however merely browsing does not require registration.

9\. The categories of personal data we may collect from you upon registration of via visiting our website: 

  * Your name
  * Your title
  * Your date of birth
  * Your contact information, including email and phone numbers
  * Demographic information
  * Your address and postcode
  * Your IP address or other online identifiers such as Cookies



## Use of Your Personal Data

10\. We use your personal data collected via the Marketing Punch sites to: 

  * Provide you with information about the products and services we offer
  * Provide you with a more personalised service
  * Conduct market research
  * Run prize draws and promotions
  * Pass on your details to selected Companies and Trusted Partners which provide you with other offers and promotions of interest to you
  * For analysis purposes or to build data products. In these instances, the information is aggregated and wherever possible anonymised in line with the ICO’s code of practice. Again, these products are of a marketing nature.



11\. We may process your personal data ourselves or through data processors that will process data on our behalf (we retail full responsibility) for ensuring the data processor complies with this policy and all current data protection regulations). 

12\. Depending on the consents that you set up at the time of registration and what personal data we hold about you, we may pass your personal data to Site Sponsors, Brand Partners or Data Partners (collectively “third parties”) who may contact you by post, email and telephone for direct marketing purposes. 

13\. Email and Telephone data will only be released to third parties where you have given your positive consent (usually at the time of registration) allowing you to fully understand your registration preferences. 

14\. You can change or update your communication preferences at any time here <http://www.offerx.co.uk/communication-preferences-login>

15\. Telephone data will only be released to carefully selected partners where it has been TPS’d (see ‘Opting Out’ below). Note: if you request a call from one of our sponsors or brand partners this will override the TPS. 

16\. We will only store your data in accordance with our Data Retention Policy. To read our Policy, [click here](https://web.archive.org/documents/data-retention-policy). 

For more information on how your Data is passed on when participating in a Branded Survey, refer to 27-33. 

## Profile Matching (aka Profiling) 

17\. To enhance the services we provide, we aim to match your profile to third companies that we determine from analysis, that will have goods or services that would be of interest to you. It makes sense for us to ensure that you only receive offers that are relevant to you and fit within the context of your lifestyle and available purchasing power. For example, if you have provided your car insurance renewal data and have consented for third parties to contact you about one month before your renewal date, we will work with third party brand partners to send you a car insurance quote tailored to your needs – thus saving you time researching the entire market. 

The data that we provide our third parties may be added to the information that they already hold about you. So, a car insurance company will check whether you have been a customer of theirs before. This is to ensure that they provide the right types of products, services and pricing to you. 

When first contacting you, they always will seek your appropriate opt in and consent. 

18\. Data sharing in this way allows them to contact you in their own name about their products, services, promotions, offers and competitions, and/or to update their records for fraud prevention, debt tracing and anti-money laundering purposes. 

19\. We will share your data with the Marketing Services Providers listed below, who will use it to create products and services to help organisations better understand the likely characteristics of their customer’s characteristics and communicate with them more effectively, and enhan find others like them across a range of marketing channels. This may mean that you receive advertising that is more relevant to you via direct mail or when you visit a website. To understand more please visit through to the websites of the companies below; Experian Ltd- <http://www.experian.co.uk/marketing-services/about/marketing-data.html>
