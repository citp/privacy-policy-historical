<p>By  using the Offerpal Media Platform, you expressly consent to the information  handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with  our Privacy Policy, please do not use the Offerpal Media Platform. </p>
<p>This  Privacy Policy should be read in connection with the Offerpal Media Terms of  Use. Your use of the Offerpal Media Platform and any personal information you  provide through the Offerpal Media Platform are subject at all time to this  Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. </p>
<p class="sub_heading">1. The Information Offerpal Media Collects</p>
<p><strong>User-provided  Information: </strong>You  may provide to Offerpal Media what is generally called "personally  identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing  address, telephone number and billing information) if you upload or download  certain content or products from the Offerpal Media Platform, enter contests or  sweepstakes, take advantage of promotions, respond to surveys, register and  subscribe for certain services, or otherwise use the features and functionality  of the Offerpal Media Platform. You may also provide to Offerpal Media  demographic information and information related to your favorite social  networking site such as the name, address and description. </p>
<p><strong>"Cookies"  Information: </strong>When  you access the Offerpal Media Platform, we may send one or more cookies - small  text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Offerpal  Media may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie  disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you  close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Offerpal  Media Platform. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web  browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie  settings. Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) use cookies on our  site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy  covers the use of cookies by Offerpal Media only and does not cover the use of  cookies by any advertisers. </p>
<p><strong>"Automatically Collected" Information: </strong>When you access the Offerpal Media Platform or  open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information  from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This  "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol  address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software  installed, system type, screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins,  language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, JavaScript  enablement, the content and pages that you access on the Offerpal Media  Platform, and the dates and times that you visit the Offerpal Media Platform,  paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages.
</p><p class="sub_heading">2. Web Beacons </p>
<p>Our  web pages may contain electronic image requests (called a "single-pixel  gif" or "web beacon" request) that allow us to count page views  and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page,  including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically  1-by-1 pixel files, but their presence can usually be seen within a browser by  clicking on "View" and then on "Source." We may also  include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in  subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. Offerpal  Media web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personally  identifiable information about our web site visitors, they are just the  technique we use to compile anonymous information about web site usage. </p>
