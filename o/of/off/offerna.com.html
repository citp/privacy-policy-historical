		<p class="terms-p">The present privacy policy (the "Policy") represents
				our internal guidelines for the management, employees and
				contractors of Offerna LLC in the context of the operation of the
				website www.offerna.com which entails the fact that users will be
				submitting and sharing certain information some of which are
				considered as personal while other are considered as public domain
				information (collectively the "User Information").</p>

<p class="terms-p">It would be helpful to start by identifying what this
				policy is and what it is not. This Policy is a code of conduct and
				an internal regulation that we circulate to the principals,
				employees, directors, service providers and shareholders of Offerna
				LLC so as to inform them of what we deem acceptable or unacceptable
				actions when it comes to handling the User Information. This Policy
				also aims at letting you know how we operate certain aspects of our
				website that store User Information and the fact that you may,
				through our website interact with third parties who may come to
				contact with User Information.</p>

<p class="terms-p">
				This Policy <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> is not </span>
				a legally binding agreement, a unilateral undertaking a
				representation or a warranty of any type to be given to users,
				government agencies, natural or juristic persons of any type or
				capacity.
</p>

<p class="terms-p">We have the full right and discretion to decide on
				the appropriate consequence for our stakeholders' commitment or
				breach of this Policy we also reserve the right to maintain such
				consequences as a confidential matter or to make it public
				information.</p>

<p class="terms-p">The reason why we receive User Information is to
				enable us to provide services through our website to our end users.
				Such information would contain inter alia information that enable us
				to identify our clients and be able to transact with them pursuant
				to applicable laws such as information pertaining to age which
				enables us to determine the capacity of our client to enter into a
				legally binding agreement, information required to enable our users
				to access our website repeatedly such as the user name and password
				as well as the email address which is used to manage the user
				account, especially, in those cases of forgotten log in names and
				passwords, information to enable us to transact with the client such
				as the preferred payment method, information required to provide the
				services to our clients such as the email address, physical address,
				mobile number which are used to send vouchers, billing and
				collection. Other information relate to user preferences and general
				interests which is a key element in our strategy to enable us to
				find the best possible promotions to match our clients' expectations
				and communicate those as effectively as possible.</p>

<p class="terms-p">
				User Information generally excludes the information that we deduce,
				compile or extract whether by ourselves or through the use of third
				party service providers, such information is generally based on
				analysis of the data that we collect from various sources as well as
				statistics and deductions. <br> We are bound by the rules of
				applicable laws with respect to handling private and personal data
				of Internet users.
</p>

<p class="terms-p">As a general rule, User Information are handled
				electronically and are not accessible to stakeholders in the context
				of day to day operation in our company. We do not share User
				Information whether with our stakeholders or with third parties. We,
				however, cooperate with law enforcement agencies and all the
				authorities that have proper jurisdiction to request User
				Information in the context of law enforcement operations and
				investigations that pertain to public interest, criminal or civil
				actions, public safety and crime prevention and fighting.</p>

<p class="terms-p">We will use User Information to tailor offers that
				best match our users' interests, habits and demographics and we will
				use our analysis to approach existing and new providers with our
				findings so that we would increase offers presented through our
				website and solicit new ones. In approaching providers, we shall use
				statistics and information derived from User Information, however
				User Information will not be conveyed to providers.</p>

<p class="terms-p">The security of User Information is important to us.
				We ensure that the providers of payment services encrypt credit card
				information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Other
				service providers that we use for collection services other than
				online credit card usage are either bound by a confidentiality
				undertaking not to use or dispose of User Information or are bound
				by other industry standard documents that ensure user privacy and
				the security of User Information.</p>

<p class="terms-p">We will follow generally accepted industry standards
				to protect User Information. No method of transmission over the
				Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure, however,
				we will continuously try to use and implement commercially
				acceptable means to protect User Information in order to ensure the
				continuity of our service and the privacy of our users.</p>

<p class="terms-p">User Information is considered as a key asset in most
				Internet based businesses, as a company, we may always be subject to
				transactions involving our assets and our equity including mergers,
				subdivisions or acquisition by third party; User Information is key
				in valuations that take place prior to such actions and are one of
				the key assets transferred once those transactions have taken place.
				We will ensure that our legal successors treat User Information in
				the same manner that we do and continue to develop and implement
				methods to better protect them.</p>

<p class="terms-p">
				Users of our service will be given the option either to alter User
				Information <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> provided
								always </span> that the alteration is lawful and does not entail
				any fraudulent behavior or request the deletion of same entirely and
				we will comply with such requests to the best of our ability
				observing solid commercial sense.
</p>

<p class="terms-p">
				Our website will likely contain advertisements or other methods
				which will link to other websites, our users are advised that we do
				not give any representation or warranty with respect to such other
				websites' policy regarding the protection and usage of personal
				information. We do not and will not recommend the security features
				or privacy policy of any third party unless we have conducted our
				due diligence on them <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and
								in those cases we shall make such recommendation explicitly. </span>

<p class="terms-p">We employ cookies, which are small text files stored
				on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We relate the
				information we store in cookies to User Information.</p>

<p class="terms-p">We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We
				use session cookies to make it easier for users to navigate our
				site. A session ID cookie expires when a browser session is
				terminated. A persistent cookie remains on the user's hard drive for
				an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by
				following directions provided in the browser's help file.</p>

<p class="terms-p">Persistent cookies are used to store log in and
				password information so that the users would not have to enter them
				every time they use our website. Persistent cookies are also used to
				track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
				experience on our site.</p>

<p class="terms-p">Our website is still usable even if cookies are
				rejected, however, the actual experience may vary depending on
				whether or not a user accepts cookies.</p>

<p class="terms-p">Some of our business partners such as advertisers and
				providers use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control
				over these cookies.</p>

<p class="terms-p">We also employ a software technology called clear
				gifs which is also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs, that help us
				better manage content on our site by informing us what content is
				effective. Clear gifs are minute graphics with a unique identifier,
				similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online
				movements of Internet users. In contrast to cookies, which are
				stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded
				almost invisibly on web pages. We relate the information gathered by
				clear gifs to User Information.</p>

<p class="terms-p">We wish to remind our users that we are only able to
				control our operation methods, however, you will directly interact
				with our providers who will have their own policies to handle your
				information. You should always exercise due care whenever you give
				out your information.</p>

<p>This Policy is implemented as of January 2011 and is accessible to
				our stakeholders. Meanwhile, as we reserve our right to substitute
				or amend this Policy without notice or consent from any party, we
				urge you to view it as often as you may.</p>	</div>
