Your privacy is important to us, so Ideal Technologies has created this Privacy Policy to explain how your information is protected, collected and used. This Privacy Policy applies to our web sites and mobile applications. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. You can always review the most current version here. By using the Sites, you consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policies may evolve in the future. If there is a conflict between our Terms of Use governing your use of the Sites and this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use control. 

### Protecting Your Privacy

In various places on the Sites, we collect "Personally Identifiable Information," such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other information that can be used to identify you or contact you. 

  * Ideal Technologies will not share any of your Personally Identifiable Information, except for the information you choose to publicly disclose in the listings you publish, with our advertisers or any third-parties for marketing purposes.
  * Ideal Technologies offers email anonymization and relay to protect your identity and reduce spam.
  * Account information is password protected. Keep your password safe.
  * Ideal Technologies does not knowingly collect any Personally Identifiable Information from persons under the age of 13, and Ideal Technologies does not permit persons under the age of 13 to register on the Sites. If Ideal Technologies learns that a listing is by a person under the age of 13, Ideal Technologies will remove that listing. Ideal Technologies, or people that place listings on Ideal Technologies, may provide links to third party web sites, which may have different privacy practices than Ideal Technologies. We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies on these third party web sites. We encourage all users to read the privacy policies of every web site you visit. 



### Registration

Registration is required to place a listing through our service or to use other types of functionality that require the service to recognize a user (e.g., Ideal Technologies Alerts). If you decide to register or sign up for certain services, you will need to give us certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as a valid e-mail address and zip code. You will also have the option to provide other Personally Identifiable Information such as your address. This Personally Identifiable Information will be used to personalize and improve your experience of our service. This information will not be disclosed to any third-party without your explicit consent. Registered users may choose to receive a copy of our newsletter or receive other mailings from us regarding our service or the Sites. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings as part of the registration process. You can review and change your Personally Identifiable Information or password at any time on the "Settings" page. 

### International Visitors

By visiting our web site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of Ideal Technologies Inc. services we may use the data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes identified in this policy or in our other communications with you, including the transmission of information outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, please understand that such data may be stored on servers located in the United States. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data. 

### Cookies

Like many web sites, Ideal Technologies uses a standard technology call "cookies." A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive that can be accessed by a specific web site to make your experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies allow our users to login without entering their ID and password each time they use Ideal Technologies. Cookies also help us understand how our users use the Sites, which allows us to improve the service. We do not use cookies to retrieve any information from your computer other than the information we provide, such as a user code. 

### Data We Collect

In addition to Personally Identifiable Information you provide at registration or by using the service, we collect the following information: 

  * Listings content. When you place a listing or a review on the Sites, we collect a variety of information related to that listing (e.g., price, model). The public will see any information that you include in your listing, and as such, Ideal Technologies has no control over how this information will be used. For that reason, please think carefully about what Personally Identifiable Information you disclose in your listing. You can always edit or deactivate any of your listings.
  * Correspondence. Correspondence between you and the other party initiated through our site, and correspondence to us.
  * "Anonymous Information" such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you visit, the search terms that you enter and the advertisements that you click. This information is used to help us diagnose problems, administer the site and otherwise improve our service to you. 
  * We may provide Badge programs from time to time. If you choose to participate in a Badge program, we may collect the information you've provided to us in connection with granting you a Badge (e.g., your age for a Badge intended for seniors).



### Data We Store

The following information is stored in our database, even after deletion, and may be archived: 

  * Registration information.
  * All listings, review and comment content.
  * Activity logs and other records.
  * Information collected in connection with the operation of our Badge programs. 



Although we make good faith efforts to store information in a secure environment that is not made available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security. 

### Use

We may use the information you disclosed to us to: 

  * Provide our services to you.
  * Provide customer service to you.
  * Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities.
  * Enforce our Terms of Use.
  * Review and use the information you provide to us in connection with our administration of any Badge program.



### Disclosure

Ideal Technologies may disclose information about its users if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: 

  * Respond to a legal process (e.g., subpoenas, court orders).
  * Respond to claims that a listing or content violates the rights of third parties.
  * Enforce our Terms of Use.
  * Protect the rights, property or personal safety of Ideal Technologies, its users or the general public.



Ideal Technologies may also disclose information with: 

  * Our partner web sites if you create an account on one of those sites.
  * Service providers under contract who help us with business operations such as fraud investigations.



If we merge with or are acquired by another company, the resulting combined company will use the information you have provided as described in this Privacy Policy.
