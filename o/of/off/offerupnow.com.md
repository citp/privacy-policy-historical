# Privacy Policy - OfferUp

LAST UPDATED: December 05, 2018

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by OfferUp, Inc. (hereafter “OfferUp”, “our,” “we,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website, mobile applications and other online services (collectively, the “OfferUp Service”) or when you otherwise interact with us. 

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with more prominent notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the OfferUp Service to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. 

Note: OfferUp is piloting a new electronic payments solution that is only available to certain users. As a result, some of the provisions of this privacy policy related to the payments solution may not apply to all users. 

#### Collection of Information

1\. **Information You Provide to Us.** OfferUp collects information that you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you register or update the details of your account, participate in identification badge programs such as TruYou, post information in order to sell any good through the OfferUp Service, enroll in any third-party operated payment processing services offered in connection with the OfferUp Service, communicate with other users, provide reviews or other comments, purchase any services from OfferUp, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, OfferUp account password, telephone number, postal address including city, state and zip code, photographs, written descriptions of your posted goods, any bids you make on offers through the OfferUp Service, any reviews or comments you make using the OfferUp Service, all correspondence or communications with other users or with us conducted via the OfferUp Service, government-issued identification documents (such as a driver’s license), and any other information you choose to provide. 

2\. **Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the OfferUp Service.** When you access or use the OfferUp Service, we automatically collect information about you, including: 

2.1. **Log Information:** We log information about your use of the OfferUp Service, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our OfferUp Service. 

2.2. **Device Information:** We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access the OfferUp Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information. 

2.3. **Location Information:** If you consent to the collection of location information from your computer or mobile device, we may collect this information when you access or use the OfferUpService, or when you otherwise consent to the collection of this information. We may also use your IP address to infer an approximate geographic location for your computer or device. For more details, please see “Your Information Choices” below. 

2.4. **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that helps us to improve the OfferUp Service and your experience, see which areas and features of the OfferUp Service are popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “gifs,” “pixel tags” and “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in the OfferUp Service or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see “Your Information Choices” below. 

3\. **Information from Third Parties.** OfferUp may, from time to time, obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the OfferUp Service in order to enhance our ability to serve you, prevent fraudulent transactions, tailor our content to you, offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for any other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site. We may also receive transaction information from Stripe Inc. when you purchase or sell a good using the OfferUp payment solution, including the date and time of sale and the amount of the sale. 

4\. **Payment Information Collected by Stripe.** OfferUp is integrated with Stripe Inc.’s (“Stripe”) services to allow sellers to accept credit card and other electronic payment methods for goods they list for sale on the OfferUp Service. Stripe provides these services directly to sellers pursuant to its own terms and privacy policy. When signing up to receive funds electronically, Stripe, and not OfferUp, collects some of the information provided by sellers via the OfferUp Service, including debit card numbers, Social Security numbers, government IDs, and bank account information.
