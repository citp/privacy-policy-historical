<h2>What information does OfficeMax collect?</h2>
<p>Through its Web Sites, OfficeMax collects "Personally Identifiable Information" which is any information that can be used to specifically identify an individual, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number or credit card number.  Users may provide us with Personally Identifiable Information and certain demographic information (such as gender, zip code, hometown or similar information) through Web Site features, including, surveys, online registration forms, sweepstakes entries and bulletin boards.  Additionally, when you visit our Web Sites our servers automatically collect certain information from you, such as the number of pages viewed and accessed, browser type and IP address.  Most of this information is non-personally identifiable information, but if we connect it or demographic information with Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat it as Personally Identifiable Information.
