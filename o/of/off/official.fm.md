From time to time, YeYo.me may need to share such PII with other trusted third parties who perform certain services and functions on YeYo.me’s behalf (such as maintenance and support for the Website). These parties only have access to the PII they need in order to perform their functions. YeYo.me may also share your personal information with users of the Website at your request, for example, you may be asked to provide your email address in exchange for a free download of song.
