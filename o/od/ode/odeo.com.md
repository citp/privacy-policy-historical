Odeo contains links to media and other websites that are not owned or controlled by Odeo. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites. Information Collection, Data Ownership and Use 

Registered users of Odeo own their personal information and data created as a result of using Odeo.com. Odeo.com and SonicMountain Inc. will retain a non-exclusive license for the duration of time the user maintains data at Odeo. In addition, for the duration of time users maintain data at Odeo, they grant all users a commercial, non-exclusive reuse license to their publicly accessible data, created through the use of Odeo, unless they choose options to limit the public distribution of their public data, such as "subscriptions", “favorites”, or "playlists". This data may be accessible by default via RSS feeds or search, as well as through other methods of public collection. 

Odeo will not share or sell your personal information, such as email addresses, to anyone without your authorization or consent, with the exception of those terms disclosed in this Privacy Statement. Users of Odeo can request at any time that their personal or public data be removed, and to the fullest extent possible, a user's data will be removed from the Odeo system. Exceptions might include data that has been depersonalized and aggregated (see following paragraph) or data that is contained in backup systems. 

Odeo will aggregate information about users of the site. "Aggregated Information" means information where personally identifying information is removed, and lots of visitor's and member's data is aggregated together to become statistical information for Odeo about how the site is used. Aggregated information that is not personally identifying for users is solely owned by Odeo and is used to improve our services. Statistical information may be shared with other parties.

This information will only be used internally to determine eligibility, notify contest winners, and to measure the success of our efforts. Publicly held contest winners may be labeled on the Odeo site in public ways through their usernames, ID's, aliases, or other representations.
