**If you fail to provide Personal Information**

16.        Where we need to collect Personal Information by law, or under the terms of a contract which we have with you (or we are intending on entering into with you), and you fail to provide that information when requested, then we may not be able to perform the contract we have, or are trying to enter into. In this case, we may not be able to provide you with the respective product or service, or we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

**Making a purchase or joining ODEON Première Club, Limitless or My ODEON**

17.        If you make a purchase, ODEON will collect the information which we need to fulfil your order and notify you of the status of your order. Where you pay by credit or debit card, we obtain a credit or debit card token relating to your credit or debit card as part of the payment authorisation process. ODEON will use credit or debit card tokens to link purchases to your account with ODEON if you have one.

18.        You generally need to be 16 or over to set up an account with us.  In the case of Limitless, it is possible to join aged 13 to 15 via a gift membership with parent or guardian consent.

19.        If you set up an account with us by joining My ODEON, ODEON Première Club or Limitless, ODEON will collect the information which we need to open, administer and run your account, and to deal with any enquiries which you may have about it. The joining process will set out the minimum information which you will need to provide (in the form of mandatory fields) and you may provide us with other relevant information if you chose.

20.        If you want to post content on the Website, or make an online booking using a CEA Card, you will need a My ODEON account.  You can get a My ODEON account using the “Sign Up” section of the Website.

21.        If you join ODEON Première Club or Limitless, we will automatically give you a My ODEON account, so that you can manage your memberships and use the Website though your My ODEON account.  If you purchase an ODEON Première Club card in cinema, you will need to set up an account with us, as an ODEON Première Club member before you can redeem or earn ODEON points. 

22.        When setting up an account with ODEON, we will collect information about your marketing preferences, and you can update your marketing preferences using your My ODEON;  however, we do not send marketing communications to Limitless members aged 13-15.

**Competitions, Surveys, Correspondence**

23.        ODEON will obtain the Personal Information which you submit, when you enter a competition or promotion on the Website, Mobile App or using ODEON Social Media.

24.        From time to time, we may contact you by email to ask you to participate in a user survey, where you have consented to such communications. Participation in surveys is completely voluntary, and we will collect such Personal Information as you provide in respect of any such surveys.

25.        If you contact us for any reason (e.g. to report a fault on the Website) we may keep a record of that correspondence.

Using our services and marketing communications from ODEON

26.        ODEON may collect information about your use of our services (including your purchases from us, and your use of My ODEON, ODEON Premiere Club, Limitless, the Website, Mobile Apps, ODEON Social Media and other ODEON Services). We may also collect information about marketing communications we send to you and how you respond to them. See Part F below, for more details about this.

**E.          Important information about cookies, mobile apps, ODEON social media, third party links and ODEON Wi-Fi**

**Cookies**

27.        ODEON uses information collected using cookies and web beacons to help us analyse, develop, manage, provide and market our goods, services and our communications to you. Certain third parties use cookies and web beacons for similar purposes for their benefit. Please read our Cookies Policy for more details in respect of the use of cookies and web beacons in respect of the ODEON Services.

28.        ODEON is the controller in respect of its own cookies only.

**Mobile Apps**

29.        If you are using Mobile Apps, then certain functionality requires location data from your device to work (e.g. find my nearest cinema). If you do not want the Mobile Apps to use your location data, please change your settings on your device; some Mobile Apps ask you if you want to do this when you download them (e.g. iPhone apps), or depending on your device, others may ask you when you access them (e.g. ODEON mobile website). If you change your mind and want to opt out later, you will need to change the settings on your Mobile App. Please see the relevant help sections for your device for more information in this regard.

**ODEON Social Media**

30.        If you are using ODEON Social Media, please remember that ODEON Social Media is provided via social media sites which have their own functionality, terms and privacy policies. You should be aware that these functions are part of the social media site, and are subject to the respective social media site’s terms and privacy policy. Please ensure that you have read these carefully, and that you have checked your personal settings to ensure that you are happy with how your information will be used by the social media site. ODEON Social Media may make use of these functions, but ODEON does not control them and is not responsible for them.

31.        ODEON Social Media may allow you to see your friend’s details and contact them. An example of this would be our Event Planner within Facebook. Where this is the case, this function is provided by the social media site provider and not ODEON. ODEON does not hold your friend’s details. Any messages which you send to friends via ODEON Social Media, use the relevant social media’s functionality and are not sent from ODEON.

**Third party links**

32.        The Website, Mobile Apps and ODEON Social Media may contain links to websites which are not controlled by ODEON. This might include a link in a third party advertisement. The fact that the Website, Mobile Apps and ODEON Social Media provide links to any such website, does not mean that ODEON endorses that website or any of the services or products it offers. We are not agents for any such websites or advertisers, and we are not authorised to make representations on their behalf (unless explicitly stated). ODEON is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such websites. You provide Personal Information to such websites at your own risk, and you should check their privacy policies accordingly.

**ODEON Wi-Fi**

33.        When you use ODEON Wi-Fi, we may collect information about:

33.1.     Your device and its location;

33.2.     The volume of data which you use;

33.3.     The websites and applications which you access; and

33.4.     Your usage by access time, frequency and location.  

However, such information is used only to provide you with access to the ODEON Wi-Fi, and is not used for any profiling, marketing or other purposes.

34.        If you do not want the ODEON Wi-Fi to use your location data, please change your settings on your device. Please see the relevant help section for your device. Disabling such access may result in loss of certain functionality accordingly.

**F.          How we use your information and the lawful bases for doing so**

**How we use your Personal Information and the lawful basis**

35.        We will only use your Personal Information in circumstances in which the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:

35.1.     Where we need to perform the contract, we are about to enter into, or have entered into, with you;

35.2.     Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests;

35.3.     Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation; or

35.4.     To protect your, or a third party’s, vital interests (i.e medical emergency situations).

**Consent as a lawful basis**

36.        Generally, we do not rely on consent as a lawful basis for processing your Personal Information, other than in relation to:

36.1.     Sending certain direct marketing communications to you;

36.2.     Using cookies on our Website or Mobile Apps (where such cookies are not of the strictly necessary type for functional purposes); or

You have the right to withdraw consent at any time by contacting us (contact details are shown in Part L below), or in respect of cookies, following the directions referred to in the Cookies Policy.

**Making a purchase, or joining ODEON Première Club, Limitless or My ODEON**

37.        If you make a purchase, ODEON will use your information to fulfil your order and notify you of the status of your order, which for online purchases will usually include sending you a booking or purchase confirmation email (this will be undertaken pursuant to our contractual performance obligations). Details of your purchases will be linked to you and your membership account, in order to provide any applicable loyalty points (in accordance with our contractual arrangements) or membership benefits (pursuant to our legitimate interests), as well as to generate a profile of the types of purchases which you prefer (again, pursuant to our legitimate interests), so that we can send you more targeted (and therefore relevant) advertising, information and offers. We may also use anonymised information derived from this, for statistical and trend analysis purposes.

38.        If you apply to join the ODEON Première Club, Limitless or My ODEON, ODEON will use your information to open, administer and run your account and to deal with any enquiries you may have about it (such activities will be undertaken in accordance with our contractual arrangements, to the extent that they relate to contractual performance, whilst other activities will be undertaken pursuant to our legitimate interests).

39.        When you make a purchase by credit or debit card, via the Website or Mobile Apps, Bookit will use the purchase information which you submit, to process your credit or debit card transaction on ODEON’s behalf.   If you join Limitless, Harlands Services Limited will process your payments on ODEON’s behalf. Such activities are undertaken pursuant to our legitimate interests to provide you with a cost effective service, whilst allowing our business to transact with you in a prudent commercial manner.

This is to safeguard our premises, business, goods and services, as well as our customers, visitors, business partners and service providers. Footage from CCTV may be used by: us; the third parties referred to in this paragraph; by our representatives or those of our third parties; the police; or health and safety investigators; in detecting, investigating and addressing any incidents.

**G.          How we may share your information with third parties**

51.        We may pass your Personal Information to the following third parties:

51.1.     Our advisers in order for them to provide us with advice;

51.2.     Other companies and individuals in order for them to perform functions on our behalf (e.g. developing, maintaining and analysing customer databases; creating, sending out and analysing customer communications; administering competitions; developing, maintaining and analysing the ODEON Services and providing customer services; and operating our ODEON membership schemes).

52.        Where we transfer your Personal Information to service providers which are acting as our processors, we will do so, on the basis that the respective third parties have agreed with us, that they with comply with the appropriate GDPR safeguards, including that they have in place adequate technical and organisational measures to protect the respective Personal Information, will not pass it on to any other party (without our explicit approval and only with valid grounds), and will not use it for any purpose other than to provide us with advice or perform the function specified on our behalf.

53.        We also reserve the right to release Personal Information without your consent, or without consulting you, when we believe that this is appropriate to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our terms and conditions or other legal rights, to protect the security of the ODEON Services, to prevent fraud, or otherwise to protect the legitimate interests of ODEON or its customers.

54.        From time to time, we may share statistical information about customers with third parties such as advertisers, business partners and sponsors, to help us and them analyse, develop, manage and market our goods and services. This information will be shared in a way that ensures that your identity is not revealed to them.

55.        Where you are a registered user of ODEON services, we may share the following information with third parties for the following marketing purposes:

55.1.     We may share your email address in an encrypted and de-identified form with third party social media platforms (such as Facebook), in order for these third parties to identify you as a registered user of their services. Such third parties then use other information that they hold about you and analyse it to identify other users of their services who share similar interests to you. You may then receive advertising and promotions about ODEON products and services on such third party social media platforms. The use of your information by such third party social media platforms is governed by their privacy policies, and any applicable consents that you have provided to such social media platforms, where such consents are required by applicable law;

55.2.     We may share a unique identifier with third parties and their partners, in order for these third parties and their partners to identify you as a registered user of their services. Such third parties and their partners then use this information to send you advertising and promotions about ODEON products and services on their websites and mobile services. The use of your information by such third party service providers is governed by their privacy policies, and any applicable consents that you have provided to such third party service providers, where such consents are required by applicable law.

56.        If ODEON or any part of ODEON's business is restructured, sold to, or integrated with, another business, we may transfer customer information (including your Personal Information) to other ODEON group companies or the new owners, as the case may be. Where ODEON operates a cinema business under a commercial arrangement with a third party, such as a cinema management agreement or a concession agreement (e.g. the BFI IMAX), we may at the end of that commercial arrangement, transfer customer information relevant to that cinema business (which may include your Personal Information) to that third party. In each case, the transferred information is to be used by the new holder of the information and its group of companies, in the same ways as set out in this Privacy Policy, including providing you with any information services you receive from ODEON.

**H.          How we protect your information, and your security responsibilities**

**Security**

57.        The nature of the Internet is such that we cannot guarantee the security of the information which you transmit to us via the Internet, and any transmission over the Internet is at your own risk. We follow strict security procedures, so that Personal Information is processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the Personal Information, including appropriate protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures. We store information which you provide to us, on secure servers, and payment transactions are encrypted using SSL technology.

58.        We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach. We will notify you, and any applicable supervisory authority, of a Personal Information breach, where we are legally required to do so.

User names and passwords

59.        If you choose, or are provided with, a user name, user identification code, password, security question and answer, verification number or any other piece of security information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential and not disclose it to any third party. If you become aware of any unauthorised use of your security information, you must inform us immediately. We have the right to disable any account and registration with us at any time, if in our opinion, you have failed to comply with your obligation to keep your security information secure.

**I.           How long we will keep your information**

**Retention arrangements – how long we will keep your Personal Information**

60.        We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary, to fulfil the purposes which we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

61.        To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

62.        For tax and legal claims purposes, we retain Transactional Information (with the associated Identity Information and Contact Information to the extent required for such purposes) for six years after an individual ceases being a customer.

63.        In some circumstances we may anonymise your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research, trend analysis, or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

**J.          Where your information may be processed**

**Transfer of Personal Information outside the European Economic Area**

64.        The Personal Information that we collect from you, may be transferred to, and processed at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, amongst other things, fulfilment of your order, provision of support or administration services, analysis of statistical data, or other functions as referred to in the Privacy & Cookies Policy. By submitting your Personal Information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

65.        Whenever we transfer your Personal Information outside the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of data protection safeguarding is afforded to it, by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

65.1.     We will only transfer your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information by the European Commission (further details in respect of such safeguards are available from: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en );

65.2.     Where we use certain service providers (including in the USA), we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Information the same protection it has in Europe (further details in respect of such safeguards are available from:  https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en); or

65.3.     Where we use providers based in the USA, we may transfer Personal Information to them, if they have agreed to comply with the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Information shared between Europe and the USA. (further details in respect of such safeguards are available from: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us, when transferring your Personal Information outside of the EEA.

**K.          Knowing your legal rights**

**Your legal rights**

66.        Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. If you wish to exercise these rights, in order to assist us with promptly dealing with them, we would request that you direct them to our Data Protection Officer, using the contact details shown in Paragraph 74 below.

67.        You have the right to:

67.1.     **Request access** to your Personal Information (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information which we hold about you, and to certain details in respect of the processing of such Personal Information.

67.2.    **  Request correction** of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have corrected, any incomplete or inaccurate data which we hold about you, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data which you provide to us.

67.3.     **Request erasure** of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

67.4.     **Object to processing** of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground, as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.

67.5.     **Request restriction** of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information, in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it, as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

67.6.     **Request the transfer** of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

67.7.     **Withdraw consent** at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

68.        You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights referred to in Paragraph 67 above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

69.        We may need to request specific information from you, to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you, to ask you for further information in relation to your request, to speed up our response.

70.        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month, if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**L.          Updating your information and contacting us or the supervisory authority**

**Updating and accessing your Personal Information and contacting us**

71.        It is important that the Personal Information which we hold about you, is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Personal Information changes during your relationship with us.

72.        If you want to modify or update your registered details at any time, you can do this by logging in to the Website. Alternatively, you may inform us by any of the methods set out at Paragraph 73 below, of any changes in your Personal Information or marketing message preferences, and we will update or modify your Personal Information accordingly.

73.        You can contact us with any queries or requests concerning your Personal Information or this Privacy Policy, by using the contact details shown on the Website "Contact Us" page (or you may choose to contact our Data Protection Officer in appropriate circumstances – contact details are shown in Paragraph 74 below). Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose information to you.

**The Data Protection Officer**

74.        We have appointed a data protection officer (“DPO”) who is responsible for overseeing enquiries, requests and complaints in relation to the Privacy & Cookies Policy, as well as your rights under the GDPR. If you wish to get in contact with our DPO, please do so using the details below:

•           Contact email: dpo@odeon.co.uk

•           Contact address: Data Protection Officer, ODEON Stoke Cinema, Marina Way, Festival Park, Stoke on Trent, ST1 5SN, UK.

Your right to contact the supervisory authority

75.        You also have the right to make a complaint at any time, to the Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so we would be grateful if you would please contact us in the first instance.
