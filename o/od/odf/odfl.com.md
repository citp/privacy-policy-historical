This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ("ODFL" or "we") collects information from users ("User" or "you") of ODFL's website (together with the websites we maintain at [www.odfl.com](http://www.odfl.com/), [www.odpromises.com](http://www.odpromises.com/), [www.ODFL4me](http://www.odfl4me/) the "Website"). We at ODFL respect your concerns about privacy and are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect about a User, how we may use the information and with whom we may share the information.

#### Terms and Conditions

By accessing or using this Website in any manner, you agree to be bound by ODFL's [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Content/termsAndConditions.faces) (the "Agreement"). Please read the Agreement carefully. If you do not accept all of the terms and conditions contained in or incorporated by reference into the Agreement, please do not use this Website.

## Information We Collect

#### Personal Identification Information

We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Website, register, submit or post information on our Website, request a service, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or participate in any of ODFL's events, promotions, activities, services, or other offers we make available on our Website. However, we collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us.

More specifically, Users may be asked for individual name and business contact information, company name, email address, postal mailing address, phone and fax number, ODFL account number, freight information, freight recipient's contact information, ODFL username and password to access ODFL's Website and resources, social media handles, payment information, and government identification numbers as required in certain circumstances.

Users may always refuse to supply personal identification information, though it may prevent them from participating in and accessing certain Website related events, promotions, activities, services, or other offers. For example, registering would give Users access to ODFL4me's enhanced tracing, customizable reports, document review, interactive bill of lading, customized rate estimates for the User's specific pricing program, and much more. 

#### Non-Personal Identification Information

We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Website. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users' means of connection to our Website, such as the operating system, the Internet service provider and other similar information. 

## Collection and Treatment of Information

#### Web Browser Cookies and Internet Tags

Our Website may automate the collection of User information by using "cookies" (a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser) and/or "internet tags" (these link web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server) to obtain "clickstream data" (User-generated data created while browsing a website). The User information we collect via these automated processes include IP address, browser characteristics, User's operating system, referring URLs, and information on User's actions taken on our Website. ODFL may also link certain data elements with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an account with us or contacted us before. We also may use third-party website analytics tools that collect information about User traffic at our Website. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict them. We believe that cookies and internet tags provide a safe and secure way to improve the usability of the Website.

In addition, ODFL uses information collected online through cookies, internet tags and other automated means for purposes such as diagnosing technical and service problems, administering our Website, identifying Users of our Website, and gathering demographic information about our Users. We use clickstream data to determine how much time Users spend on web pages of our Website, how users navigate through our Website, and how we may tailor our Website to better meet the needs of our Users. We also may use the information we obtain about Users in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection. 

#### Sharing User's Personal Information

We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others except as described in this Privacy Policy. To perform our services, we share shipping information with certain third parties. These third parties are authorized to use the information only as needed to perform services on ODFL's behalf or to comply with legal requirements.

We also may disclose information about User (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about the User in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).

#### How ODFL Protects User's Personal Information

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect User's personal information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. In addition, we also implement appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Website. If ODFL collects account information for payment or credit, ODFL will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered. ODFL will also take security measures to protect such information.

#### Third Party Links

ODFL's Website may contain links to websites operated by parties other than ODFL. Such links are provided for your reference and convenience only. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Website or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party's website. ODFL strongly recommends that User review the third party's terms and policies. 

#### Compliance With Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Website from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our Website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

ODFL has the discretion to update this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.
