### How we use your information to make automated decisions

We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on personal information we have about you or your business. These automated decisions can affect the products, services or features we may offer you now or in the future, or the price that we charge you for them.

Here are the types of automated decision we make:

 **Pricing**  
We may decide what to charge for some products and services based on what we know.

 **Tailoring products and services**  
We may place you in groups with similar customers. These are called customer segments. We use these to study and learn about our customers’ needs, and to make decisions based on what we learn. This helps us to design products and services for different customer segments, and to manage our relationships with them.

 **Detecting fraud**  
We use your personal information to help decide if your personal or business accounts may be being used for fraud or money-laundering. We may detect that an account is being used in ways that fraudsters work. Or we may notice that an account is being used in a way that is unusual for you or your business. If we think there is a risk of fraud, we may stop activity on the accounts or refuse access to them.

 **Opening accounts**  
When you open an account with us, we check that you or your business meets the conditions needed to open the account. This may include checking contact details and previous account records we hold for you.

 **Your rights  
** As a person you have rights over automated decisions.

  * You can ask that we do not make our decision based on the automation alone.
  * You can object to an automated decision, and ask that a person reviews it.



If you want to know more about these rights, please contact us.

### Sending data outside of the EEA

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

We will only send your data outside of the European Economic Area (‘EEA’) to:

  * Follow your instructions.
  * Comply with a legal duty.
  * Work with our agents and advisers who we use to help run your accounts and services.



If we do transfer information to our agents or advisers outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if it was being used in the EEA. We’ll use one of these safeguards:

  * Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA. Learn more [on the European Commission Justice website](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm).
  * Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA. Read more about this here [on the European Commission Justice website](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm),
  * Transfer it to organisations that are part of Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure those standards are similar to what is used within the EEA. You can find out more [about data protection on the European Commission Justice website](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/data-collection/data-transfer/index_en.htm).

### If you choose not to give personal information

We may need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you.

If you choose not to give us this personal information, it may delay or prevent us from meeting our obligations. It may also mean that we cannot perform services needed to run your account or comply with our policies. It could mean that we cancel a product or service you have with us.

Any data collection that is optional would be made clear at the point of collection.

* * *

### Marketing

We may use your personal information to tell you about relevant products and offers. This is what we mean when we talk about ‘marketing’.

The personal information we have for you is made up of what you tell us, and data we collect when you use our services, or from third parties we work with.

We study this to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.

We can only use your personal information to send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a ‘legitimate interest’. That is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. It must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you.

You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages by contacting us at any time.

Whatever you choose, you’ll still receive statements, and other important information such as changes to your existing products and services.

We may ask you to confirm or update your choices, if you take out any new products or services with us in future. We will also ask you to do this if there are changes in the law, regulation, or the structure of our business.

If you change your mind you can update your choices at any time by contacting us.
