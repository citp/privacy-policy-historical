# Privacy Policy | OVO New Energy

At OVO Energy, we're committed to providing you with unbeatable value and an excellent service. So, we collect the information that you give us when you contact us. Then we use it to provide you with any goods or services requested, to administer your accounts, for risk assessment, for marketing, to analyse your account histories and to generally improve our service to you. We may also contact credit reference agencies who will record the search. If we intend to use information for any other purposes we'll tell you when we collect it and you'll have at least 30 days to object. This privacy policy only covers OVO Energy's websites and the links within these sites to our half hourly online service. Links within these sites to other websites are not covered by this policy.

 **Data security protection**  
All OVO Energy companies comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. We only use personal data fairly and lawfully, and ensure that it is kept secure. Nothing is stored online and our systems are extremely well protected. And, we will not pass the information that you give us to any organisations beyond OVO Energy Limited, our associated and subsidiary companies and our agents and service providers, unless we inform you otherwise and you don't object.

 **What do we collect?**  
We collect the information requested by our contact forms, together with any comments or ideas that you may send us. And we monitor site traffic. Discovering the pages that are of most interest to you means that we can make them more accessible. We will (unless it's impractical) tell you, if we obtain and store information from any other source and also, how we intend to use it.

 **How can you find out what is stored about you?**  
Just ask us! You can email us at [enquiries@ovoenergy.com](mailto:enquiries@ovoenergy.com) or write OVO Energy, The OVO Barn, College Farm Buildings, Tetbury Road, Cirencester, Gloucestershire,GL7 6PY

The information that you request will be provided within a maximum of 40 calendar days. We try to ensure that the information we hold is accurate, up to date and relevant and we'll be happy to correct any inaccuracies.

 **What are cookies?**  
Cookies are files that are recorded in temporary Internet folders on your PC.

They're a useful tool because they enable us to get to know you better, by recording the way you use OVO Energy.com. We're able to identify your preferences and provide you with a more relevant customer experience.

Like most web sites, OVO Energy.com uses a Unique Visitor Cookie (which is supplied and managed by a carefully selected statistics provider) to identify your PC by a random number (eg #12489). It records no personal data.

Cookies also enable us to provide you with certain facilities, like the savings calculator and the wish list in the homemover section.

A credit checking cookie also enables businesses to take advantage of OVO Energy credit checking service offers.  
 **  
What about email?**  
If you've said you're happy for us to correspond with you by email - we will. But should you, for whatever reason, decide you no longer want to receive email from us, you'll be able to "unsubscribe" immediately.  
And if we update our privacy policy?

You'll be able to read about it on this page - as soon as it happens.  
 **  
External links**  
From time to time OVO Energy include hypertext links to sites which are created by individuals and companies outside OVO Energy. We do this when there is a particular relevance to the topic you're reading about. And whilst we endeavour to check that the content of these sites is suitable, we unfortunately cannot take any responsibility for the practices of the companies who publish the sites that we link to, nor the integrity of the content contained within them.
