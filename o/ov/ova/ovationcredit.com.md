##### WHY DO WE NEED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?

In order to provide the types of services we provide to you we must collect certain necessary information in order to perform those services.

Once you have retained Ovation, we use you personal information to correct inaccuracies, mistakes, and misleading items on your credit reports. Additionally, we use your personal information to provide you with superior customer service, and to communicate with you regarding your case. We also use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest service announcements, feature updates, special offers, and other information we think you would like to hear about.
