We request that you set a password for access to our download page. The password and your email identify you when you return to the download page so you do not have to enter your personal information again. When you login to our site to access a password protected areas, such as our download page, we set a security cookie that lasts as long as your browser is running. This keeps us from having to request your password for each protected page that you access.

Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. If you order a product that is to be electronically downloaded, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, and any other benefits that may be made available to registered users. 

## Registration Information

Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Registration Information resides on a secure server that only selected OverDrive personnel have access to via a password. In addition to the information you provide, we automatically record your IP address when you place an order to help us detect fraudulent activity. We may share this with the financial institution that issued the credit card with which an order was placed, or with law enforcement authorities, if we determine use of the credit card was fraudulent. 

## E-Mail/Online Forms

In various places on our site, you will find links for sending us an email message as well as online forms to contact us through. We use your email address to send you a reply and we will retain your message only for later referral should you ever decide to contact us again. Your message and email address remain confidential unless you specifically give us permission otherwise. 

## External Links

We have provided links to other sites, outside the control of OverDrive, that we think you may find useful. If you click these links, you will leave OverDrive and enter sites that may have different privacy policies than OverDrive.

## Sharing of Information and Unsolicited Communications

Aside from the previously mentioned third parties involved in the processing of your order, we do not share your personally identifiable information with any other entities.

For example, the only way for you to receive our email newsletter is if you choose to subscribe, either through the form on our home page or help desk page or by having the appropriate box checked during the ordering process. 

## Security

We utilize industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit card information during our online checkout process. In addition, we utilize the same encryption standard when transferring your credit card data to our internal fulfillment system. To further enhance our security measures, our fulfillment system is not accessible via the Internet and we delete from our web site database all credit card information within 24 hours of receipt. We have also taken the appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information after it has been transferred to our fulfillment system. For example, our computer network is password protected, and is inaccessible via the Internet. Paper copies, if any, are shredded before disposal.
