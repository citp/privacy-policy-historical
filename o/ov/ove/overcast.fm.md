# Overcast

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Overcast’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect

When creating an account, you will be asked to enter an optional email address and a password. Email addresses are **only** used for logging in and password resets. We don’t send promotional emails.

If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We use push notifications to initiate background downloads and notify you of new episodes. We **never** use notifications for marketing.

We store information about your podcasts, episodes, and listening progress to sync this information between the website and your devices. We also collect anonymous statistics about which podcasts are most popular to help inform our recommendation engine.

If you connect a Twitter account:

  * Episodes that you “recommend” may appear in Overcast to people who follow you on Twitter, identifying you as the recommender.
  * Any podcasts you add to Overcast may appear to people who follow you on Twitter. You will not be identified as the source, although people may be able to deduce which podcasts likely came from you.
  * To provide these recommendations, we store a Twitter login token to periodically look up your Twitter username, avatar, and list of people you follow. This is a read-only token that cannot post tweets or make any changes to your account, and no other information is read or stored.
  * At any time, you can revoke Overcast’s access to your Twitter account in our app, or in your account settings on Twitter’s website.



If you upload files to Overcast, we need to store them until you delete them.

We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in.

Like most websites and apps, we also store information through the use of software that may be transparent to users. For example, we may log your IP address and general information about your browser or device.

### **In-app analytics**

Overcast’s iOS app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app and prioritize future development efforts. Crash reports are also collected to help improve the app.

### **In-app ads**

Overcast’s iOS app includes ads for non-Premium subscribers. No personal data is used to target these ads except the directory categories of podcasts that you’re subscribed to (such as “Technology”, “Business”, etc.).

The only data collected by each ad is the number of times it has been viewed and tapped, and for podcast ads, the number of new subscriptions resulting from viewing it.

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share your personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Overcast’s functionality.

We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as:

  * How many people listen to a particular podcast with Overcast.
  * The number of views, taps, and subscriptions resulting from in-app ads.



We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.

For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS, and passwords are not stored: they are [hashed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) using advanced, well-researched methods. (At the time of writing, [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) is used, but that may be upgraded to a more advanced algorithm in the future such as [scrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) without notice.)

## Accessing your information

You may access or change your information or delete your account at any time from the app.

## Third-party links and content

Overcast displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds and sites, and downloads podcast files directly from each podcast’s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Information for European Union Customers

By using Overcast and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

## International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email [privacy@overcast.fm](mailto:privacy@overcast.fm).
