<li>Third parties for business reasons: In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the Site and the most popular features or Services accessed.
<p>Please note that our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling of your information once it is shared. Rather, the privacy policies of the various third parties will govern.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect.
<p><b>Choice/Opt Out</b></p>
We give our users the opportunity to &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask for the information, including the sharing of personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Please be aware that this may result in our not being able to provide certain services to you that require us to share information with third parties. If you choose to receive communications from us but later wish to discontinue receiving communications or our Services, you can opt-out by contacting us via email or mail using the contact information provided below.
<p>Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us.
