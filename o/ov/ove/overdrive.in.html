<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We collect your information that is personally identifiable to you, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. By accepting the User Agreement you expressly agree to receive this information.</p>
<p>We use your email address, your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site.</p>
<p>We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular on rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look for users using multiple User IDs or aliases.</p>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our services. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier and quicker.</p>
<p>To fully use our services, you will need to register using our online registration form, where you will be required to provide us with your contact information and other personal information as described in our electronic membership registration form.</p>
<p>The system automatically tracks certain information about you based upon your behavior on our site. This information is used to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve users. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.</p>
<p>In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our site. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. We use cookies since it will allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information, which is targeted, to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.</p>
<p>If you choose to buy or sell on our site, we collect information about your buying and selling behavior. We also collect other users' comments about you in our feedback area. If you choose to post messages in our bulletin board, chat rooms or other message areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect such information about you as you choose to disclose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government, or for that matter third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
<p>We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.</p>
<p>Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications would remain private. As a general proposition, we will not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party.</p>
<p>We may use third party Suppliers and Service Providers to facilitate our services. For example, we may outsource the operations of one or more aspects of our site to a Supplier or Service Provider who performs services according to our requirements. In some instances, the Service Provider may collect information directly from you (such as the situation where we ask a Service Provider to conduct a survey for us).</p>
<p>In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the Supplier or Service Provider, and all information disclosures you make will be strictly optional. In all cases, we restrict how these Suppliers and Other Service Providers may access, use and disclose your information. In general, we do not permit these Suppliers and Other Service Providers to sell your information to third parties.</p>
<p>We will share much of our data, including personally identifiable information about you, with our subsidiaries and other websites so that you gain greater value addition from the services and information provided by them. To the extent that these entities are getting access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. We usually require our subsidiaries and other web sites to follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document.</p>
<p>Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our chat rooms or other message areas or the feedback area. We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information would be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.</p>
<p>To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are buyers or sellers on our system or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them.</p>
<p>To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since "www.overdrive.in" does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
<p>"www.overdrive.in " uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.</p>
