In order to generate usage statistics to help us improve our web site, we automatically collect certain information on every visitor to the web site. However, this information does not disclose "personal identifiers" (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.).

Examples of this type of information includes the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the date and time you accessed this site, the Internet protocol address of the individual computer (or proxy server) making the request, and the Internet address of the site from which you may have linked to this site. 

All information collected by way of server log files is used in aggregate form only, and may be analyzed for trends and statistics.

You are free to provide or not to provide the requested information. If you choose not to provide this type of information, you can still visit most of the web site, but you may be unable to participate in certain online forums. Any personal information voluntarily provided by visitors, including personal information submitted on online forms and e-mail, will be used for the purposes stated on the web page and may also be shared with other agencies as required by law or pursuant to agency authority. Information submitted through this web site also may be subject to disclosure pursuant to a public records request.
