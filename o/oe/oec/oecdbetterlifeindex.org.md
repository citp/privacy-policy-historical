# Privacy Policy – OECD Better Life Initiative

## Privacy Protection

This policy establishes how we handle the information we learn about you when you visit the main OECD website ([www.oecd.org](http://www.oecd.org/)), any of its satellite website(s) or any of their pages (collectively “the OECD website(s)”). Protecting the privacy and personal data of our visitors is of utmost importance to us. Protecting your privacy and your personal data is an important aspect of the way we create, organise and implement our activities on-line and off-line. The OECD website(s) follow(s) the principles set out in the Recommendation of the Council concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (C(80)58/FINAL).

## Linkages Characteristics

The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to the OECD website(s), notably the OECDiLibrary ([www.OECD-iLibrary.org](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/)) and the OECD Online Bookshop ([www.oecd.org/bookshop](http://www.oecd.org/bookshop)). Other bodies/entities (such as, but not limited to, NEA, IEA, ITF, FATF, etc.) linked to the OECD may have slightly different practices, though the commitment to your privacy will always be the same. You are encouraged to review the privacy statements of other bodies/entities when visiting their websites. Our website(s) may include links to third party Web server(s) for online payments.

## Cookies and Other Technologies

As described above, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to our website(s) to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on the OECD website(s), but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. We use the information that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our website(s), and to help us make our website(s) more useful to visitors. This includes analysing these logs periodically to measure the traffic through our servers, the number of pages visited and the level of demand for pages and topics of interest. The logs may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the data on our servers.

We collect the anonymous information we mentioned above through the use of various technologies, one of which is called “cookies”. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. For example, OECD.Stat and the iLibrary record whether you are using the English or French interface so whenever you visit these sites, you are taken to the language you prefer. Other session information (marked lists, search terms) is recorded with an expiration date. On the OECD Online Bookshop and “MyOECD” (if users register for it), cookies are used to save the visitor’s password so that it does not have to be re-entered at each new visit. The following information is stored in the cookies:

  * IP address
  * Session number 
  * Customer ID (first name, last name, job function)
  * Identification number for online payments, when used.
  * If the user has chosen “remember login and password”, those two items are encoded and added to the cookie.
  * If a “registered” user to MyOECD returns to the site without logging in, the ID stored in the cookie are used to track the user (unless the user manually deleted the cookie, at which point the server will automatically regenerate another cookie).



Also, when we collect personal data from you in connection with a transaction we may extract some information about that transaction in an anonymous format and combine it with other anonymous information.

This anonymous information is used and analysed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patters. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner, you can either disable your cookies or opt-out at the order or request stage.

We collect the personal data that you volunteer on registration for “MyOECD”, order, survey, competition, or other forms, or by e-mail. For more details on these data and the reason why we process them, see Other personal data volunteered and processed.

We do not associate the information stored in a visitor’s cookie with any other personal data about that visitor.

All our employees and processors who have access to personal data and are associated with the processing of that data are obliged to respect the confidentiality of data.

## Individual Participation / Access

You can ask us whether we are keeping personal data about you, and you can also request to receive a copy of that personal data. Before sending you any personal data, we will ask you to provide proof of your identity. If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right to refuse to send you the personal data.

We will make a sincere effort to respond in a timely manner to your requests to the previous questions or to correct inaccuracies in your personal information.

## Security

We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personal information. The OECD has implemented technologies and security policies to protect the stored personal data of our users from unauthorised access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction and accidental loss. We will continue to enhance our security procedures, as new technology becomes available. OECD employees and processors who have access to personal data are obliged to respect the privacy of our visitors and the confidentiality of their personal data.

## Personalised URL

With the “MyOECD” function, the OECD provides a personalised URL (link) that brings the visitor to a personalised Web page. Such a personal URL is readily identifiable and by clicking on that link and going to a personal Web page you are agreeing to let OECD collect information about your session visits. We use this information to help us provide you with information that matches your interests. If you do not wish information to be used in this way, simply do not click on the “MyOECD” option.

## Links

Throughout the OECD website(s), you will find links to third party websites. For example, our Online Bookshop website includes a link to a third party Web server for online payments. Please note that the OECD is not responsible for the privacy policies or content on third party sites.

The OECD website enables you to communicate with other visitors and to post information accessible by others. You should be aware that when you use these services, your data may be collected by other visitors.

## Notifications of Changes

As the OECD creates new services that may generate a need to amend this privacy statement, the OECD will highlight such changes on the OECD website home page. You will also find available the Previous Privacy policy statement.
