<h1>OEMsTrade Privacy Policy</h1>

OEMsTrade is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information we learn about you while you visit our site. The information that we receive depends on what you do during your visit, and what service(s) you request
<br><br>
<b>Data Collected</b><br>
OEMsTrade collects two types of information: Personal and Demographic. Personal information is any information that you choose to submit to us and that is specific to your identification (i.e. name, address, phone number, email). Demographic information is information that cannot be associated with you personally (i.e. domain information, zip codes, areas of interest). We also keep track of your browsing patterns.
<br><br>
<b>Use of Data</b><br>
When you request a service, place an order, submit feedback, or participate in a seminar or survey, it is necessary for you to offer certain personal information about yourself so that we could serve your needs. We will not send you information unless you specifically request it, or we feel that the information would benefit your business needs. If you decide that you do not want to receive further information, simply contact us and request to be removed from the contact list. When you sign up for service(s), a customer representative may contact you to follow up. The demographic information that is collected through our site is used to evaluate how our site is used and how it can be improved. It may also be used for marketing and investment analysis.
<br><br>
<b>Security</b><br>
All data collected on our secure product order forms will be encrypted for your security and privacy
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
Some features of this site use cookies. Cookies are small files that the site places on your hard drive for identification purposes. Please note that cookies cannot read information on your hard drive. We may use cookies to measure our web trafficking processes, so that we may make our site more efficient. We also may use cookies to offer you certain services and to customize your visit. If you are a registered user, you can specifically request that our site remembers your login information. By doing so, you are allowing us to place a permanent cookie onto your computer. You may choose to turn off cookies completely, but you will not be able to use certain site services. 
<br><br>
<b>IP address</b><br>
When a visitor requests pages at OEMsTrade.com, our Web servers automatically recognize the browser's domain name and IP address as most Web sites do. This information is collected for statistical and diagnostic purposes only.
<br><br>
<b>Contact Us</b><br>
If you have any questions or comments regarding this privacy policy, please contact us and a legal representative will respond to your question/comment.
