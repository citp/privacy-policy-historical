                <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on April 15, 2013.</p>
                <p>SupplyFrame, Inc. (“<strong>SupplyFrame</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) takes the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. By visiting and using the SupplyFrame Offerings or registering for the SupplyFrame Offerings and creating an Account, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Frame-It Terms of Service that you can find at Frame-It Terms of Service and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.</p>
                <h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy describes SupplyFrame’s practices with respect to Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use the SupplyFrame Offerings. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information that is collected by third parties that SupplyFrame does not own or control or that do not support SupplyFrame in providing the SupplyFrame Offerings.</p>
                <p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.</p>
                <p>“<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.</p>
                <p>We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from users of the SupplyFrame Offerings (“<strong>Users</strong>”).</p>
                <p>BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
                <p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.</p>
                <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you register for the SupplyFrame Offerings and create an Account, we collect a username, your e-mail address, and a password for your Account.</li><br>
                    <li>When you register for the SupplyFrame Offerings we collect, on an optional basis, certain information to complete your profile, including your name, gender, birthday, phone number, address, city, state, country, and website.</li><br>
                    <li>If you participate in one of our surveys, we will collect any Personal Information contained in your responses to such survey and any additional profile information you provide. When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) your e-mail.</li><br>
                    <li>If you make a posting or comment on a posting on the SupplyFrame Offerings, we will collect any Personal Information contained in such posting.</li><br>
                    <li>If you sign up for a feature of the SupplyFrame Offerings for which we charge a fee, we will collect your first and last name, billing address, credit card or payment account number and any other information needed to complete the transaction.</li><br>
                    <li>We may also collect Personal Information, such as demographic information from you via the SupplyFrame Offerings or at other points in the Sites that state that Personal Information is being collected.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</h2>

We may use Cookies to improve your experience and a “reverse IP lookup” to determine the company associated with your IP address. </p>
                <p>Since the foregoing information may be collected when you are signed into the Supply Frame Offerings or after you click on a link contained in an email sent by us, this information may be associated by us with Personal Information that we have collected from you.</p>

If you have opted-in to receive e-mail communications from a Third Party Company and later wish to discontinue receipt of these e-mails, please contact the Third Party Company directly to update your preferences. The privacy policies of our Third Party Companies may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information that we collect and disclose to such Third Party Companies.

However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this information except to help us provide the SupplyFrame Offerings.</p>
                <p>We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “<strong>Affiliates</strong>”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>In the event SupplyFrame goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SupplyFrame or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to SupplyFrame sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.</p>
                <p>We may (and you authorize us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) to enforce any agreement we may have entered into with you and to enforce the Privacy Policy; or (c) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, other Users, or third parties.</p>

You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to terminate the Account you may have with us.

You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.</p>
                <h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
                <p>The SupplyFrame Offerings may contain links to other web sites that are not owned or controlled by SupplyFrame.

                <h2>Changes in this Privacy Policy</h2>
