# Privacy Policy - OBIECorp.com

    

    
    OBIE Corp.com has a **very simple** **straightforward** privacy policy **:** we do not offer your e-mail address, shipping & billing information, or your purchasing history to any outside individual or commercial agency (unless directly ordered to do so by a court of law). We understand the concerns and complaints of customers who are unwittingly giving their personal purchasing history and shipping information to commercial agencies through hardware registration, software registration and internet transactions. We find this to be an unethical business practice that is conducted for only one purpose **:** financial gain. Commercial agencies that "harvest" such information routinely pay the suppliers who retrieved the information from the unknowing customer. The commercial agency then sells the information to other businesses that use the information to solicit business from the customer through junk mail and internet spam-mail. 

    **This has _never_ been and _never_ will be a business practice that we engage in.**

    Sincerely, 
    Wayne Obie 
    President & C.E.O.
