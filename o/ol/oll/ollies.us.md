### Information You Submit **  **

As a visitor to our Sites you can be assured that at no time will we collect personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide that information to us as described in the next section.  We respect your privacy online and will never share any of your personal information with third parties.

The only exception to the collection of personal information is when you specifically and knowingly provide your contact information to us when communicating with us via our online form to request information, to update your Ollie’s Army member information, or to be contacted by Ollie’s.  Any information provided by you through our online form is used solely for the purpose provided.

While we are the sole owner of all information collected on our Sites, as we develop our business we may sell our business or buy another business.  In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets.  In the event that we or substantially all of our assets are acquired, personal information about our customers may be one of the transferred assets.

We will also disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) comply with a written request from a law enforcement agency if the information requested to assist that agency with the investigation/prosecution of a crime; or (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our Sites or the public.

We will not use your personal information in a way that is incompatible with these stated purposes, unless we obtain your prior consent.

### Security and Your Account

We will take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information that you transmit to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.  However, no Internet transmission is ever fully secure, and we cannot guarantee that information transmitted via our Sites will remain uncompromised and confidential at all times.  When we collect other information from our users, it is stored in an area to which the general public does not have access.  We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to ensure that personal information is stored and treated responsibly. No system of protection is perfect, however, and unauthorized third parties may attempt to gain access, or actually gain access to this area of our computer network.

In the event that any use of any aspect of our Sites involves log-in credentials, please bear in mind that anyone you provide with your log-in information will also have access to your account and personally identifiable information.  If you use our Sites you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any log-in credentials associated with the Sites.

### Children (Under the Age of 13)

We protect children's privacy seriously. We do not seek to collect personal information about children through our Sites. If we become aware that a person submitting information to us through any part of our Sites is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of information about their child before we have discovered and deleted the information, we will of course honor that request.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions on our Sites and you agree to any such changes upon your continued use of our Sites.  When changes are made, we will update the effective date of this Policy.
