**Online Privacy and Credit Card Protection Policy**

At Olive Tree Bible Software we want you to feel safe and secure when you provide us with your personal information online. For this reason we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your credit card and other sensitive information when you make product purchases or request technical assistance. The process of encryption prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing your information as it is securely transmitted over the internet. Once received, your credit card information is not transmitted over the internet again. Even with the very best protection policies and safeguard procedures in place, there is always the remote possibility of fraud. If you believe unauthorized use of your credit information has occurred, follow the [reporting procedures](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/atmcard.htm) defined by your credit card's issuing bank and contact us immediately. Most credit card companies cover all charges that result form unauthorized use of your credit card or may limit your liability to $50. 

Our store is very secure. At checkout you can see the little gold lock is closed and that indicates SSL is being used for the transaction.  
SSL is short for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents via the Internet. SSL works by using a public key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL connection. Both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer support SSL, and many Websites use the protocol to protect confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with https: instead of http:.
