# Privacy Policy | Oliver Bonas

### Data Protection

Oliver Bonas LTD is a registered data user under the Data Protection Act.

We will never pass on your details on to a third party for marketing purposes. We may contact you with promotions we think might interest you, as part of our market research, either by mail, telephone or email.

As with all retail websites, we collect personal information when opening your account and processing your orders. We will automatically collect information such as your browser IP address to make shopping with us easier, for example, remembering your log-in details.

The information we collect is:

  * Your name, so we know who you are
  * Email address, so we can email you order confirmations, delivery delays, offers etc.
  * Delivery address, an obvious one
  * Date of Birth - so we can send you a pressie!
  * Telephone number, we'll only call if we have a delivery problem.
  * Credit card details, we only ask for these when you place an order.



If you have questions about your personal data or our privacy policy, please contact us at orders@oliverbonas.com.

We use the latest secure server technology to ensure this information is protected to the highest standards. We use encryption to safeguard your credit card information and only accept orders from web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - this means you cannot inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection. Most web browsers above version three support this security. This encryption makes it virtually impossible for unauthorised parties to read any information that you send us. The encryption technique we use is the highest standard available for e-commerce.

  * Online customers will require a log-in and password to access their account.
  * Our courier service will have selected access to your details for delivery purposes only.
