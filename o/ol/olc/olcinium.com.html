                      protecting the information collected through its online 

                      products, online services and websites including, but not 

                      limited to Olcinium’s Angry Birds games (together 

                      “Services”). Olcinium has adopted this privacy policy 

                      (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how Olcinium collects, 

                      stores, and uses the information collected in connection 

                      with Olcinium’s Services.<br>

                      Should you have any questions relating to this Privacy 

                      Policy, please contact us at info@facebook-desktop.com.<br>

                      BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE 

                      ACCESSING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY 

                      AND GIVE AN EXPLICIT AND INFORMED CONSENT TO THE 

                      PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS 

                      PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY 

                      POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE, REGISTER TO OR 

                      OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES. Olcinium reserves the right 

                      to modify this Privacy Policy at reasonable times, so 

                      please review it frequently. If Olcinium makes material or 

                      significant changes to this Privacy Policy, Olcinium may 

                      post a notice on Olcinium’s website along with the updated

                      “non-personal data” means information that does not

                      is data Olcinium collects about the use of Olcinium 

                      Services, from which any personally identifiable data has 

                      been removed.<br>

                      Olcinium may use tools or third party analytical software 

                      to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data 

                      that does not directly enable Olcinium to identify you. 

                      The types of non-personal data Olcinium may collect and 

                      use include, but are not limited to: (i) device

                      other non-personal data as reasonably required by Olcinium 

                      to enhance the Services and other Olcinium products and 

                      services.<br>

                      Olcinium may use and disclose to Olcinium’s partners and 

                      contractors the collected non-personal data for purposes 

                      of analyzing usage of the Services, advertisement serving, 

                      managing and providing the Services and to further develop 

                      the Services and other Olcinium services and products.<br>

                      You recognize and agree that the analytics companies 

                      utilized by Olcinium may combine the information collected

                      from other services or products relating to your 

                      activities. These companies collect and use information

                      Ad Serving Technology<br>

&nbsp;</h3>

                      <p align="justify">Olcinium reserves the right to use and 

                      disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of 

                      advertisement by Olcinium or Olcinium’s partners and 

                      contractors. Olcinium may employ third party ad serving 

                      technologies that use certain methods to collect 

                      information as a result of ad serving through Services. 

                      Olcinium or third parties operating the ad serving 

                      technology may use demographic and location information as 

                      well as information logged from your hardware or device to 

                      ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within 

                      the Service. Olcinium or third parties may collect and use 

                      data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP 

                      address (including for purposes of determining your 

                      approximate geographic location), UDID, software, 

                      applications, hardware, browser information, internet and 

                      on-line usage information and in-game information. The 

                      foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance 

                      with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the 

                      company providing the ad serving technology.<br>

                      You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who 

                      deliver ads for Olcinium may combine the information 

                      collected with other information they have independently 

                      collected from other services or products. These companies 

                      collect and use information under their own privacy 

                      policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated 

                      into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this 

                      technology, do not use or access Services. Although 

                      Olcinium takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct 

                      such advertising companies to comply with the terms and 

                      conditions of this Privacy Policy, Olcinium does not have 

                      access to or control of third party technologies.<br>

                      Personal data may, however, occasionally be disclosed in 

                      accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy

                      with this Privacy Policy.<br>

                      Olcinium may hire agents and contractors to collect and

                      pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary 

                      to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy 

                      unless a longer retention period is required or permitted 

                      by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer 

                      needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, 

                      Olcinium deletes all aforementioned data in its 

                      possession. Olcinium does not verify the correctness of 

                      personal data.<br>

                      Even if data is changed or deleted, Olcinium may still 

                      retain some of the data to resolve disputes, enforce 

                      Olcinium user agreements, and comply with technical and

                      Olcinium follows generally accepted industry standards and

                      no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility

                      unauthorized access to your personal data. By using the
