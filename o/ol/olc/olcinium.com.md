Your continued use of Services will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.

###   
Non-personal data  
 

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you. Additionally, non-personal data means “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data Olcinium collects about the use of Olcinium Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.  
Olcinium may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable Olcinium to identify you. The types of non-personal data Olcinium may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique device identifier or other device identifier ("UDID"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and location; (v) game score and achievements; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by Olcinium to enhance the Services and other Olcinium products and services.  
Olcinium may use and disclose to Olcinium’s partners and contractors the collected non-personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Services and to further develop the Services and other Olcinium services and products.  
You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by Olcinium may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.

###   
Ad Serving Technology  
 

Olcinium reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Olcinium or Olcinium’s partners and contractors. Olcinium may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services. Olcinium or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. Olcinium or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), UDID, software, applications, hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.  
You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Olcinium may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Services. Although Olcinium takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Olcinium does not have access to or control of third party technologies.  
 

### Personal Data

Please note that certain features of the Services may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain additional information about you.

### Disclosure and Transfer of Personal Data  
 

Olcinium collects and processes personal data on a voluntary basis and it is not in the business of selling your personal data to third parties. Personal data may, however, occasionally be disclosed in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy. Additionally, Olcinium may disclose personal data to its parent companies and its subsidiaries in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  
Olcinium may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on Olcinium’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Olcinium. These agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes. Olcinium may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers. Olcinium has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for Olcinium. Olcinium is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by mandatory law.  
Olcinium may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or Olcinium to legal liability. Olcinium may also disclose your personal data to third parties when Olcinium has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with Olcinium’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or Olcinium believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect Olcinium’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Olcinium.  
 

### Data Retention and Correctness  
 

Olcinium retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, Olcinium deletes all aforementioned data in its possession. Olcinium does not verify the correctness of personal data.  
Even if data is changed or deleted, Olcinium may still retain some of the data to resolve disputes, enforce Olcinium user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of Services.  
 

### Cookies, beacons and tracking  
 

The Services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, clear GIFs and web beacons. Olcinium treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.  
E-mails and other electronic communications Olcinium sends to you may contain code that enables Olcinium to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed (if any). Olcinium may combine that information to other information Olcinium has about you and Olcinium may use that information to improve the Services and/or provide customized communications to you.  
 

### Third Party Terms and Conditions  
 

Please note that your access to and use of the Services may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and privacy policies, including but not limited to application stores, mobile software platforms, on-line gaming platforms, social networking services and payment providers. You recognize and agree that Olcinium is not liable for any such third party terms and conditions and their use of your personal data.  
Olcinium may in its discretion make available links through advertisements or otherwise enable you to access third party products or services. Please note that, while using such products or services, you are using products or services developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by Olcinium. Olcinium is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies, the content of their products or services, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. The fact that Olcinium is linking to those products or services does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.  
Please note that certain Services that Olcinium may offer, such as multiplayer gaming, social networking and gaming console services, may use third party services to provide authentication for the Services with a gaming console ID, social networking ID or gaming network account. When you register to join or use the Services from a third-party gaming or social networking system, certain personally identifiable user and/or membership data may be transferred automatically to and from Olcinium and you hereby consent to the processing, using, combining, disclosing and retaining of such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy by Olcinium.  
Safeguards  
Olcinium follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in Olcinium’s possession. Only those persons with a need to process your personal data in connection with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance, have access to your personal data in Olcinium’s possession. Personal data collected by Olcinium is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. To prevent unauthorized on-line access to personal data, Olcinium maintains personal data behind a firewall-protected server. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite Olcinium’s reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your personal data. By using the Services, you assume this risk.  
 

### Other

You may choose to disclose data about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to the Services. Any data that you disclose in any of these forums, blogs, chats or the like is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. Olcinium is not responsible for any personal data you choose to make public in any of these forums.  
If you are under 15 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian’s permission to use or access the Services. Olcinium takes children’s privacy seriously, and encourages parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. Olcinium does not knowingly collect any personal information from children below the aforementioned age and if Olcinium learns that Olcinium has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under the aforementioned age, Olcinium will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such personal data from Olcinium’s records.  
Olcinium may store and/or transfer your personal data to its affiliates and partners in and outside of EU/EEA member states and the United States in accordance with mandatory legislation and this Privacy Policy. Olcinium may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of Olcinium’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.
