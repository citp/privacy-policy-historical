  &nbsp;</p>
<h2>
  12. Cookies Policy - Information Olderiswiser Media Limited collects from you</h2>
<p>
  <b>a. What is a cookie?</b><br>
  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.<br>
  Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of olderiswiser.com features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.<br>
  During the course of any visit to olderiswiser.com, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.<br>
  <br>
  <b>b. How does Olderiswiser Media Limited use cookies?</b><br>
  Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example: if on a previous visit you went to our education pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight educational information on your second and subsequent visits.<br>
  Olderiswiser Media Limited also use a number of independent measurement and research companies. They gather information regarding the visitors to Olderiswiser Media Limited sites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. Olderiswiser Media Limited uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. Olderiswiser Media Limited requires that third parties to comply strictly with its instruction (see paragraph 6 above). Certain other areas of olderiswiser.com may use cookies for a specific reason - for example, to help an online game work effectively on your device. If this is the case, the local terms for that area of the website will make this clear and you should refer to those local terms for additional information.</p>
