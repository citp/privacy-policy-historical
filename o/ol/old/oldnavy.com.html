      site? Why do we use cookies?</a><br>A cookie is a small data file that websites 
      often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit. A cookie may 
      contain information, such as a unique user ID, that is used to track the 
      pages you’ve visited. We use cookies, but we do not store personally 
      identifiable information in your cookie. 
      </p><p>We use cookies in order to improve your shopping 
      experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your order as you shop on 
      our site. They also allow us to recognize registered customers when they 
      visit, and to provide those customers with their account information. If 
      you register with oldnavy.com or order from our site, we use cookies to 
      monitor and maintain information about how you use our site and what you 
      buy. If you have not registered with us or ordered from us, we may monitor 
      and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that 
      does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us serve you 
      better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, 
      contests, and promotions. 
      </p><p>Through our use of cookies, we track and maintain 
      the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting 
      oldnavy.com. Keeping track of where you came from can help us to improve 
      our site design and to fulfill our contracts with our business partners. 
      We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other 
      websites. 
      </p><p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your 
      browser. However, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track 
      your order, which means you will be unable to make purchases from our 
      site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user, so you 
      will be unable to access (or change or delete) your account information.

      <p><a name="secure"></a><a class="red-c">How 
      does Old Navy make sure my order information is 
      secure?</a><br>Protecting your order information is our priority. We use 
      Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure the security of your 
      online order information. To check the security of your connection, look 
      at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after you access our 
      secure server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon 
      your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at 
      the URL line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the 
      first characters of the site's address should change from "http" to 
      "https." 
      </p><p>Some browser versions and some firewalls don’t 
      permit communication through secure servers. If this is the case for you, 
      you’ll be unable to connect to the server, so you won’t be able to 
      mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If for any 
      reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your 
      order with us by phone at 1-800-OLD-NAVY, Option 1. Our Customer Care 
      representatives will be happy to assist you.
