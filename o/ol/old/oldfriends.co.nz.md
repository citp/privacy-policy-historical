**Use of your information**

**Email**  
It is the policy of Old Friends to send our members email from time to time. It is also our policy to immediately remove any member from our mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, Old Friends may send a monthly newsletter to members. Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list. 

We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to [email us](https://web.archive.org/Help.aspx) with your questions or comments.
