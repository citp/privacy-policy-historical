THE OLD HOUSE WEB'S  
PRIVACY STATEMENT

It is crucial to us at The Old House Web that your personal privacy remains protected. This statement summarizes our policy on privacy.

  * We do not sell, rent, or share any personal information we receive or collect from you to anyone else. Information submitted to The Old House Web for purchases, for personalized services and for entry in prize drawings will be used to fulfill orders and for identification, drawing and notification purposes only.
  * Like most Internet sites, we track the total number of visitors using different sections and pages on our Web site. Occasionally we also invite our users to anonymously share certain personal information about themselves -- such as age, sex, income levels, hobbies and the like. In both cases, we aggregate this information and use it to gain a better understanding of our users' interests, and to improve the quality of our sites. While we share this collective information with our advertisers, we do not share information on specific readers with our advertisers or anyone else.
  * Users should be aware when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on The Old House Web's bulletin boards, that this information can be collected and used by third parties. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of The Old House Web.
  * Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of The Old House Web's Internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature. However, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide customized delivery of some information available on The Old House Web, such as localized weather reports.



While the above statements and policies do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party, the staff at The Old House Web wishes to reiterate our opening statement: Your right to personal privacy is crucial to us. We will endeavor to respect it. 

If you have any questions concerning our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us by writing to [webmaster@mail.oldhouseweb.com](mailto:webmaster@mail.oldhouseweb.com)
