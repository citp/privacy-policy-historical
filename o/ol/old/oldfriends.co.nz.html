                    your computer's hard drive when you use our Website. We use cookies to deliver information 
                    and fresh content specific to your interests and to improve the experience of using our 
                    site. Cookies are widely used on most major websites.

                    Trade Me uses "session" cookies to temporarily store information to help you use the site.  
                    This information is used to deliver the right content to you as you use the site and avoids 
                    unnecessarily asking you to log in. Session cookies expire immediately when you close your

                    Old Friends also uses "persistent" cookies to personalise the user experience, to
                    help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how
                    often members visit Old Friends each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track
                    users on Trade Me and helps us identify users abusing the Old Friends service.
                    A persistent auto-login cookie is also stored when you select the “remember me” 
                    option when logging in.  The auto-login cookie is removed when you log out.

                    Trade Me also participates in Google's AdWords pay-per-click advertising programme. 
                    AdWords advertisements appear on Google's search result pages and on the Google 
                    Network. Google uses cookies to measure the number of Google users that click on 
                    an advertisement and visit certain Old Friends web pages, or who complete certain 
                    actions on the Website. Google provides this data to Trade Me without identifying

                    <b>Advertising and third party links</b><br>
                    Some Old Friends advertisers may request information directly from users, or link to 
                    sites that do so. Old Friends has no control over its advertisers' privacy policies, 
                    and encourages users to review such policies prior to submitting any personal 
                    information to them.

                    <br>
                    Old Friends contains non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to 
                    enhance the member experience. Old Friends has no control of either the content or 
                    privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an endorsement 
                    of these sites except where otherwise noted. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In some cases, third party advertisers may also use cookies in certain advertisements 
                    that appear on the Website for advertising purposes. For example, Old Friends 
                    participates in Google AdSense advertising, and as part of this, Google may use 
                    cookies in order to reduce the number of times you see the same ad.

                    <b>Nielsen//Online – New Zealand internet statistics</b><br>
                    Old Friends, like most large New Zealand websites, uses the Nielsen//Online counting 
                    system to collect information such as the number of visitors per day or the number 
                    of pages requested per day. To do this, Old Friends has a small piece of code on 
                    each page which counts these statistics. This enables us to see where we are in 
                    the list of New Zealand websites.
