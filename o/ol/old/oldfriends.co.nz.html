                    We work diligently to protect the security of your personal information. It is important
                    for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer

                    <b>Cookies</b><br>
                    Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file
                    on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. We use cookies to improve
                    the member experience. We also use them to deliver information and fresh content
                    specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites.

                    <br>
                    Trade Me mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once
                    you leave Old Friends. These are used so our service can remember that you have
                    logged in already and prevent you doing so more frequently. The technology we use
                    (Microsoft Active Server Pages), requires the use of session cookies. Session cookies
                    expire and are deleted after 30 minutes of no activity on Old Friends.

                    Old Friends also uses persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to
                    help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how
                    often members visit Old Friends each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track
                    users on Trade Me and helps us identify users abusing the Old Friends service.

                    <b>Other information we collect</b><br>
                    We use additional information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
                    interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This
                    information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on
                    our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not),
                    what browser you are using, and your IP address.

                    Users who login may have their IP addresses recorded. This information can be used
                    to track users who abuse the Old Friends system and will be only be provided to
                    legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud. IP addresses can be used, in conjunction
                    with an Internet Service Provider, to find the dial-in account of a user and, ultimately,
                    further information to identify a user. This information is stored securely and
                    will not be provided to other members or non-authorised parties.
