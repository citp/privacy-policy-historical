        <h1>ology Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of NewPress, LLC
    ("we", "our" or "us") on the
    collection, use and disclosure of your information on http://ology.com
    (the "Site") and the services, features, content or
    applications we offer (collectively with the Site, the "Services").
    We receive information about you from various sources, including:
    (i) if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user
    account on the Services (your "Account");
    (ii) your use of the Services generally; and
    (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services,
    you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage,
    disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy
    Policy.
</p>

<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable
    information ("Personal Information") gathered when you are
    using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our
    treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share
    with us or that we share with our business partners.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that
    we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party
    websites, services and applications ("Third Party Services")
    that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do
    not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those
    Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot
    take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third
    Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies
    of any Third Party Services you access.
</p>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue
    to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the
    Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal
    Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.
</p>

<p><i>Account Information</i>:</p>
<p>When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be
    Personal Information, such as your username, password and email address.
    You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by
    creating an account on the Services and providing Personal Information to
    us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not
    be anonymous. If you access the Services through Facebook credentials, we
    may automatically collect certain information that could be Personal
    Information, such as your name, picture, and email address. We will use
    all information available through Facebook in accordance with
    Facebook's policies and your preferences selected through Facebook.
    We may use your contact information to send you information about our
    Services, but only rarely when we feel such information is important. You
    may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings,
    although we, regardless, reserve the right to contact you when we believe
    it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.
</p>

<p><i>User Content</i>:</p>
<p>Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services,
    such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may
    be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We
    may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that
    does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p><i>IP Address and Other Information Collected Automatically</i>:</p>
<p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when
    you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie
    information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also
    to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the
    Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).
</p>
<p>Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as
    the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in
    aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner
    that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us
    and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use
    parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.
</p>

<p><i>Email Communications</i>:</p>
<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this
    confirmation to improve our customer service.
</p>

<p><i>Information Collected Using Cookies</i>:</p>
<p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through
    your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in
    a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable
    our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you
    visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.
</p>
<p>Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do
    not combine the general information collected through cookies with other
    Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use
    cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the
    Services and may associate that information with your Account.
</p>
<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will
    prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on
    the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on
    acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend
    that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage
    of the most attractive features of the Services.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the
    use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third
    parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites
    to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.
</p>

<p><i>Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons</i>:</p>
<p>To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also
    allow third parties to serve advertisements, through the Services. These
    advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and
    may come from third party companies called "ad networks." Ad
    networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology
    vendors and research firms.
</p>
<p>Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who
    fit a certain general profile category may be based on anonymized
    information inferred from information provided to us by a user,
    including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the
    Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your
    activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information
    to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.
</p>
<p>To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known
    as a "web beacon") from an ad network to you through the
    Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated
    auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons
    also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you
    visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these
    advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these
    companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had
    requested a web page from their site.
</p>

<p><i>Aggregate Information</i>:</p>
<p>We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and
    registered users, collectively, use the Services ("Aggregate
    Information"). Some of this information is derived from Personal
    Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and
    cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser.
</p>

<h2>How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</h2>
<p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a
    result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared
    publicly or with third parties.
</p>

<p><i>IP Address Information</i>:</p>
<p>While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not
    made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our
    partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct
    business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p><i>Aggregate Information</i>:</p>
<p>We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and
    other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of
    statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often
    people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates
    improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In
    addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or
    otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently
    developed or acquired.
</p>

<p><i>Email Communications with Us</i>:</p>
<p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other
    communications from us, such as communications relating to your Account.
    Communications relating to your Account will be sent for purposes important
    to the Services, such as password recovery. We may use your email address
    to contact you for editorial purposes, to advise you of any changes to our
    Site, and to send you messages about our marketing partners'
    products.
</p>

<p><i>Information Shared with Our Agents</i>:</p>
<p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain
    tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our
    "Agents"). We may need to share Personal Information with
    our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell
    you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal
    Information or other information we share with them beyond what is
    necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal
    Information with our Agents.
</p>

<p><i>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers</i>:</p>
<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of
    transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred
    business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were
    acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user
    information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by
    a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
    acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information
    as set forth in this policy.
</p>

<p><i>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</i>:</p>
<p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
    information as it reasonably believes is necessary to
    (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental
    request,
    (ii) enforce the Terms of Service, including investigation of potential
    violations hereof,
    (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
    issues,
    (iv) respond to user support requests, or
    (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This
    includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
    fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
</p>

<p><i>Information We Share With Your Consent</i>:</p>
<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal
    Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent
    the sharing of this information.
</p>

<h2>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we
    collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
    information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use
    information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services
    or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy
    Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first
    posted.
</p>

<h2>What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services,
    please send us a detailed message to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:info@newpress.co">info@newpress.co</a>. We will make every
    effort to resolve your concerns.
