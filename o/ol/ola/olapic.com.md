# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Olapic site and platform (“Platform”) and the content management services, including web sites for uploading content like [www.photorank.me](https://web.archive.org/web/20180908082603id_/http://www.olapic.com/privacy-policy/www.photorank.me), or any other Olapic owned and operated web site (collectively and including the Platform, the “Services”) provided by Olapic, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Olapic”), and to customers who have engaged Olapic or have used any of its Services (“Customers”). This privacy policy describes how Olapic collects and uses the Personal Information (described below) you or social media users provide through the Services, including through our mobile application. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information.

If you have an unresolved privacy or personal information use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact Olapic’s Data Protection Representative (contact information below).

**1\. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a prominent notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. If you are an Olapic Customer, we may notify you of such changes by email (sent to the email address specified in a Customer’s account). Any access or use of the Services by you after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such changes, modifications or additions. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If you do not agree to abide by these practices or any future privacy policy, please do not use or access the Services.

**2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect information that may allow the identification of a natural person (“Personal Information”) (i) from Customers, (ii) from individuals who upload user-generated content to Customer or other digital properties (such as a Customer’s website, Instagram or Facebook) on behalf of our Customers (“Social Media Users”), and (iii) from users which interact with the Customer galleries.

With regard to each of these groups we collect the following Personal Information:

Customers: We collect the name, email address, telephone number, Internet Protocol (IP) address and (if available) the social media user name of those employees that Olapic interacts with or has interacted with.

Social Media Users: We collect information from Social Media Users such as public uploads and posts, including publicly posted photographs. With such assets, we process name, social media username, physical address (if available), email address (if available), IP address, and geo location (if available).

End Users: When End Users interact with our websites or user galleries we collect IP address and date/timestamp. If an End User buys products directly from a Customer digital property, Olapic additionally collects purchase information (including purchased product ID, transaction ID, transaction price, date of purchase, unique ID that our Customer may have assigned to such End User), email address and username (if provided by End Users to Customers). If an End User provides their name, business title, and email address to subscribe to an Olapic newsletter or to participate in a competition by Olapic, we will collect and store such information as provided by the End Users to us.

**3\. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Current Customers: We use the Personal Information we have collected from you to provide you with information about and access to our Services, to communicate with you about updates, maintenance, outages or other technical matters concerning our Services, to respond to your questions or inquiries regarding our Services and to allow you to download information such as whitepapers, all to fulfil our contractual obligations.

Social Media Users: We only process Personal Information we collect from you to provide the services for which our Customers have engaged us. Our Customers to whom you have submitted content through the Olapic Services or whose brand hashtags, @brand mentions or branded location tags you have included in your social media posts, may use your username or email address to communicate with you, in addition to using your photo. IP and geo-location are used to filter content by region, country or other local area. Such data is used with your consent only.

End Users: We process the Personal Information described above to allow our Customers to analyze with which digital assets you interacted prior to purchasing a product from a Customer digital property after interacting with the user galleries on those digital properties. Furthermore, we collect the information to improve our Services, and to improve marketing, analytics and the functionality of our Services. Finally, we log IP and date/timestamp to investigate and/or prevent security breaches. We collect personal data during newsletter signup and participation in competitions in order to be able to send the newsletter and inform the competition winners.

**4\. ACCESS TO AND DELETION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Upon request, Olapic will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal Information and, if that is the case, what Personal Information we hold. If your Personal Information changes, or if you wish to exercise your right to be forgotten, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your information from our records by (for Customers) logging into your account and making the appropriate changes or emailing your Account Manager directly, or (for Social Media and End Users) contacting Olapic at [privacy@olapic.com](mailto:privacy@olapic.com). We will respond to requests to access Personal Information under this paragraph within 14 business days of receipt of such request.

If the Personal Information is controlled by the Olapic Customer, we will inform you how to exercise your rights mentioned above vis-à-vis such Customer.

**5\. COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, scripts or similar technologies are used by Olapic and our third-party marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Services, tracking users’ movements around the Services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by third parties on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

With respect to cookies in particular, we use cookies to analyze End User interactions with our Services such as purchases on the digital properties of those Customers who have chosen to implement them. End Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Services, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Services may be limited.

We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our web sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union [click here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**6\. FRAMING**

Some of our Services, such as websites listing job openings, utilize framing techniques to serve content to and from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our Services. Please be aware that you are providing your Personal Information to these third parties and not to Olapic.

If you no longer wish to receive these communications you can follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in those emails or contact us at [support@olapic.com](mailto:support@olapic.com).

We will send Customers communications about the functioning of our Services and similar service-related communications when it is necessary or useful to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, Customers may not opt-out of these communications. If you do not wish to receive these communications, you have the option to deactivate your account, or provide an alternative email address for contact by contacting us at [privacy@olapic.com](mailto:privacy@olapic.com).

**10\. SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES**

Websites owned and operated by Olapic may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button. These features may collect your IP address, information about which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing them.

**11\. TESTIMONIALS**

We may post Customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our websites which may contain personally identifiable information. We obtain the Customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial if we include Personal Information, such as a name, of the Customer along with the testimonial. If you are the subject of a testimonial and want your testimonial removed, please contact us at [privacy@olapic.com](mailto:privacy@olapic.com).

**12\. PUBLIC FORUMS**

Our websites may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [support@olapic.com](mailto:support@olapic.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such information, you can remove it, by either logging into such application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate third party application.

**13\. MOBILE APPLICATION**

When you download our mobile application and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and system and performance information.

We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application and the Services.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

**14\. SECURING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Nonetheless, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we make no guarantee as to the security of your information or that your information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. When you enter sensitive information (such as Customer log in credentials entered onto the Olapic dashboard), we encrypt the transmission and storage of that information using industry standard encryption technologies. If you contact us by email or a “contact us” or similar feature on our website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. If you have any questions regarding security you can contact us at privacy@olapic.com.

We will make any legally or contractually required disclosures of any breach of confidentiality, privacy, or integrity of your personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

**15\. BUSINESS TRANSFER**

In the event that Olapic is or substantially all of its assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, such databases containing Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event of such a transfer, Olapic will place a prominent notice on our Services of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

**16\. CHILDREN’S POLICY**

The Olapic Services are in no way directed to persons under the age of 18. Olapic collects Personal Information through third party social media services that are not directed at children under the age of 13. If you have reason to believe that Olapic collected the information of an individual under 18, please contact us at [legal@olapic.com](mailto:legal@olapic.com), and we will endeavor to delete that information and terminate the child’s information from our databases.
