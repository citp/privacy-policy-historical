# Olapic.com - Gather and share your wedding pictures

## Summary

This site collects no more data about you than most other websites.  
The information that the user introduces in his public profile, as well as his public photo albums are published, and except in very limited circumstances, will be a permanent part of this site. If you decide to publish something you must keep this in mind.  
This privacy policy will be reviewed 

## Public data and publishing

Browsing this site doesn't reveal your identity publicly; though see Private Logging later in this document for more information. 

## Author identification

When creating a profile or uploading pictures, a name and an email address will be required. You do not have to select your real name. Your email address will not be published.  
Your actions will be identified by your IP address. These numbers could potentially be traceable to identifying information about you, whether it is your home ISP or the University or Work account where the IP address is registered. Your IP address could potentially be used in conjunction with other data to identify you.  
If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.  
If so, you might like to try Tor, an anonymous browsing service. Please see <http://tor.eff.org/> for more details. 

## Cookies for registered users

This site uses cookies to remember your log in data if you choose that option. This is a convenience for you so that you do not need to log in the next time you comment.  
You may wish to clear these cookies and the browser cache if you wish to refrain from revealing any identifying information, especially if you are using a public or shared computer. 

## Private logging

Any time you visit a page on the internet, you send quite a bit of information to the server. The web servers that host this site maintain access logs with the information that you send. This information is used to provide site statistics and to get an idea of popular pages and what sites link here. We do not intend to use these logs to identify legitimate users.  
The data logged may be used by us to solve technical problems with the site and, in cases of abuse of this site, to investigate the abuse.  
Again, if you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address. 

## Data release policy

Our policy is to only release the data we collect in the following circumstances: 

  * As required by law
  * To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.
  * When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.
  * For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user's Internet Service Provider.
  * If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.
  * When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this website.



## No selling of information

We will not sell information collected via this site, such as your email address, to third parties. 

## Information security

We make no guarantee that the information that you provide us will be secure. 

## Email

You are required to give your email address when you log in.  
If you are concerned, you may wish to get a free email account or attempt to use a remail service.
