                <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
                <p>www.OurProperties.com.au ("the web site") is a web site of GiFang Group Pty Ltd and its related companies ("We", "our" and "us" in this Privacy Policy). By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of the web site, which is set out below. The Privacy Policy relates to the collection and use of personal information you may supply to us through your conduct on the web site.</p>
                <br><p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. This Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable to the web site or our other web sites. We do not make any representations about third party web sites that may be linked to the web site.</p>
                 <br><p>We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to our sites, in particular information that is capable of identifying an individual ("personal information") and relevant real estate properties. This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which your personal information, obtained through the web site, will be dealt with. By using the web site, or entering into an agreement with us in relation to the website or any of our other websites you are taken to have read, and agreed to the collection, use, disclosure and handling of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Information We Receive</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></p>

                <p>
                    <b>Information About Yourself.</b> We manage personal information obtained through or displayed on the web site or otherwise provided by real estate agents, real estate developers or visitors to the web site. When you sign up for the web site you provide us with your name, email, and phone number. You will also be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once you register you can provide other information about yourself, for example, your current city, office address, preference for purchase and investment, and stories about you and/or your properties. We may also ask you for personal information if you report a problem with the website or willing to provide feedback and/or complaints.
                </p>
                 <br><p><b>Privacy Act.</b> In collecting and handling personal information, we are bound by the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988, including the National Privacy Principles, and any other applicable privacy laws in Australia. In conjunction with our multi-lingual websites for the purpose of attracting buying interests internationally, there may be circumstances in which we need to transfer personal information outside Australia. If we do so, we strive to ensure that any organisation to which the information is transferred will be subject to binding privacy obligations.</p>
                 <br><p><b>Content.</b>One of the primary reasons people use the web site is to share content with others. Examples include when you update the status of your property(s), add or remove a property, upload or record a video on your property, share a link, create an event or a group, make a comment, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with content you share on the web site (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.</p>
                 <br><p><b>Transactional Information.</b>We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on the web site. If you do not want us to store your payment source account number, you can contact us via details on the ‘contact us’ page. </p>
                 <br><p><b>Friend Information.</b>We may offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends’ email addresses so that you can invite your contacts who do not have the web site accounts to join. This is optional. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you have uploaded your contacts’ information.</p>
                <p><strong>Information we collect when you interact with the web site:</strong></p>
                <p><b>Site activity information.</b>We keep track of some of the actions you take on the web site, such as attending an event, uploading a photo, submitting an inquiry, or connecting with an application. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or content to us. For example, if you share a property article, in addition to storing the actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it.</p>
                 <br><p><b>Access Device and Browser Information.</b>When you access the web site from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.</p>
                 <br><p><b>Cookie Information.</b>Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are industry standard and are used by most Web sites, including those operated by us, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to customise the web site to your needs. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with some features of our on-line services.</p>
                <p><strong>Information we receive from third parties:</strong></p>

                <p><b>Web site Platform.</b>We do not own or operate the applications or web sites that you use through the web site Platform (such as widgets and utilities). Whenever you connect with a platform application or web site, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take.

                <p><strong>Data Processing and Analysis</strong></p>
                <p>Like many web site operators, we also use the independent company Google (Google Analytics) to measure and analyse the internet usage across our web sites. Google Analytics is a leader in the internet industry in interactive measurement technologies. We use Google Analytics services to collect the following core information on the usage of our web sites, including but not limited to: <br>
                    <br>•	The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on our web sites;
                    <br>•	The number of unique browsers to our web sites;
                    <br>•	Location data, weblogs and other communication data and resources you access;
                    <br> •	How long these unique browsers (on average) spend on our web sites when they do visit; 
                    <br> •	Common entry and exit points into our web sites.
                </p>
                <br> <p>This aggregate, non-personal information is collated by Google Analytics and provided to us to assist in analysing the usage of our web sites. The Google Analytics data may also be accessible by media organizations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet portals.</p>
                <br> <p>All pages on our web sites are coded with software provided by Google Analytics that stores a "cookie" in the browser, which contains a unique identifier. This enables Google Analytics to track the number of unique browsers to our web sites. This information is collected and aggregated by Google Analytics, and in no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. We do not and will not marry any data collected by Google Analytics with any personal information collected on our web sites.</p>
                <br> <p>Google Analytics software code cannot be disabled entirely on our web sites, as Google Analytics code takes into account all web-browser configurations, including the disabling of Java and Javascript. Google Analytics’ methods of measuring unique visitors takes into account the proportion of visitors who have disabled cookies in their browser.
