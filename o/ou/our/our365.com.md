# Privacy - Our365

Effective Date:  November 1, 2010

### Introduction

The Our365 Privacy Policy describes the manner in which we collect, use, maintain, disclose and otherwise manage Personal Information collected and controlled by Our365, including Personal Information collected through the web site available at www.Our365.com (the "Web site"). 

### The Principles

  


### Principle 1 - Accountability

1.1 The Our365 Chief Information Officer and President of Hospital Operations oversee Our365's compliance with the Our365 Privacy Policy.  

### Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes - Collection of Information

2.1 Our365 collects Personal Information from the Customer as a result of a Customer request: 

  * Through orders taken in-hospital by an Our365 representative (i.e., an Our365 employee or a nurse or volunteer acting on behalf of Our365); 
  * Through online and electronic activity with Our365; 
  * Through our customer service department; 
  * Through registration or participation in an online forum or community; 
  * Through telephone, paper and online surveys, contests and sweepstakes; and 
  * Through enrollment in Our365 News.



2.2 Our365 collects Personal Information for the following purposes:

  * To process Our365 Newborn Portrait orders and returns; 
  * To process payments by Customers for their orders;
  * To process WebNursery search requests and enrollment in Our365 News; 
  * To communicate information and special offers from Our365 News and/or Marketing Participants to Customers;
  * To respond to requests for information about our products and services; 
  * To better understand and analyze Customers’ responses, needs and preferences;
  * To develop, enhance, market and provide products and services to meet those needs; and 
  * To notify Customers if they win a contest or sweepstakes.



Our365’s “Our Community” is run on a platform operated by Ning.com.  Thus, when Customers register for Our Community, any information they provide is given to both Our365 and Ning.com.  Ning.com’s privacy practices may vary from those of Our365, so we encourage Customers to carefully review its Privacy Policy.

### Principle 3 - Consent/Opt-Out 

Our365 obtains consent from Customers for the collection, use or disclosure of Customer's Personal Information at the time of collection.  

### Principle 4 - Limiting Collection 

All information collected by Our365 is gathered directly from the Customer; it is never obtained from hospital records or medical files. 

4.1 We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. 

4.2 Our Web site uses cookies. A "cookie" is a piece of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site to remember who you are the next time you log on. Many pages on our Web site where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies.

4.3 We use cookies on our Web site to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Web site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on our Web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our Web site). You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Web site, you will limit the functionality we can provide. 

4.4 Our365 collects non-personally identifiable information from users of its Web site. Non-personally identifiable information is anonymous information that cannot be associated with a specific individual. The types of non-personally identifiable information that we collect (either directly, through the use of "cookies," or through the use of a third-party tracking system) include the IP address of the computer making the request. This IP address may be associated with your personal computer, or with a computer used by the portal through which you accessed the Internet, such as your Internet Service Provider or company network. IP addresses are not linked to Personal Information.

4.5 The Our365 system also gathers information about (1) the areas users visit on the Web site, (2) the links that users select from within the Web site to other areas of the World Wide Web, or (3) elsewhere online. Our365 uses information about the areas Web site users visit and the links users select in the aggregate to understand how users (as a group) use the services and resources provided on our Web site. This way, the company knows which areas of its Web site are most popular, which areas need development and what technologies are being used so that Our365 may continually improve its site and provide users with a positive online experience. 

### Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention 

Our365 will only use or disclose Personal Information for purposes specified in this Privacy Commitment or as you otherwise consent. 

5.1 Our365 provides Customers who have photographs taken while in the hospital a web page on Our365.com for their baby that may also be linked to the birth hospital's home page. Customers must provide consent to this service prior to Baby Web Page being posted to the WebNursery® section of Our365.com. 

5.2 The following information may be displayed on Baby Web Page: baby's first name, middle name and last initial; weight; and date and time of birth. Depending on the hospital where Customers’ photographs were taken, Customers may have the option to password protect their Baby Web Page using the "Edit Baby Info" link within WebNursery®, or the My Account link in the site header. When Baby’s Web Page is password protected, only those individuals whom the Customer invites to view Baby Web Page are able to do so.

5.3 In the course of processing a transaction with you (e.g., fulfilling a Newborn Portrait order), we may share some of your Personal Information with certain entities that we have contracted with to process and/or manage transactions, data management, and communications on our behalf. Such functions include package deliveries and credit card payment processing. Our365 may give these companies access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to provide you with these specific services. 

5.4 We may use Personal Information to communicate information and special offers from Our365 and Our365 News. 

5.5 Our365 may also share your Personal Information from time to time with its Marketing Participants so that they can inform you about their products, services, rewards and special offers. 

5.6 Our365 does not trade, rent or sell Personal Information without your prior consent. 

5.7 Our365 may disclose Personal Information that it collects if, in its opinion, such disclosure is required to comply with legal process or procedure, for example, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or other governmental inquiry or order. It may also disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. We may also disclose personal information to assist us in collecting a debt owed by you. 

5.8 Our365 may also transfer any Personal Information in the event that all or a portion of our business or assets are sold or transferred to a third party acquirer, including without limitation in the course of insolvency proceedings. 

5.9 Our365 may share non-personally identifiable information with its suppliers and other third parties for trend analysis and other statistical purposes. 

### Principle 6 - Accuracy

Our365 uses reasonable efforts to keep Personal Information accurate, complete and up-to-date. 

6.1 Our365 updates Personal Information in its database after Customers provide updated Personal Information to Our365. 

6.2 Customers are responsible for informing Our365 about changes to Personal Information, as appropriate. 

### Principle 7 - Safeguards

Our365 protects Personal Information in its custody and control with reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information. 

7.1 Our365 has implemented administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect the Personal Information in its custody and control against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification of Personal Information in our custody and control. Our365 protects Personal Information regardless of the format in which it is held. 

7.2 The methods of protection for Personal Information include: 

  * Physical measures, for example, locked filing cabinets and restricted access to offices;
  * Administrative measures, for example, employee confidentiality agreements, security clearances and limiting access on a "need-to-know" basis; and 
  * Technological measures, for example, the use of passwords, firewalls and encryption. 



7.3 Online access to your Personal Information may be protected with a password you select. You alone are responsible for any and all activity that occurs on our Web site under such password. You agree to immediately notify Our365 of any unauthorized use of your password or user name or any other breach of security. You agree to provide true, current, complete and accurate information as requested on any registration form to which our Web site may direct you, and to update that registration information as soon as possible after any information on such registration form changes. 

7.4 Personal Information is stored on databases in Our365 production facilities and at a third-party database management and storage facility in the U.S.  Our365 may in the future store information on storage facilities available on the Internet; this practice is commonly known as cloud computing. 

7.5 When Our365 uses a third-party service provider to process information on its behalf, the third party is contractually required to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the Personal Information in its custody, and to only permit its employees to access the information to the extent necessary to perform the services. Further, the service providers are contractually required only to retain Personal Information as long as necessary to complete the assigned task, subject to applicable law. 

7.6 Our365 has appropriate training programs in place and provides employees with information about its policies and procedures for maintaining the privacy of Customers' Personal Information and the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of Personal Information. 

7.7 Personal Information is disposed of or destroyed with care to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information. 

### Principle 8 - Openness 

Our365 makes specific information about its policies and practices relating to the management of Personal Information readily available to Customer, through face-to-face interaction with Our365 in-hospital representatives and photographers, written materials, its Web site, and agents in its Customer Care Center. 

### Principle 9 - Individual Access 

Upon request, Our365 provides Customers with a general right of access to their Personal Information held by Our365 and an account of its use and disclosure. 

9.1 Customers can request access to their Personal Information held by Our365 by contacting Our365 at the address provided in Section 10.2. 

9.2 Our365 may request sufficient information from the Customer including passwords to verify the identity of the Customer and the existence, use and disclosure of Personal Information held by Our365. 

9.3 A Customer may challenge the accuracy and completeness of the Personal Information contained in the Our365 database and have it amended as appropriate. When Our365 does not resolve a challenge to the satisfaction of the Customer, the Personal Information relating to that Customer will reflect the unresolved challenge. 

9.4 Our365 amends the Personal Information contained in the Our365 databases to address inaccuracies or incompleteness of the Personal Information when notified of such inaccuracies or incompleteness by Customers. 

9.5 If Our365 does not provide access to all the Personal Information it holds about a Customer, it will provide the reasons for denying access to the Customer. 

### Principle 10 - Challenging Compliance/Inquiries

10.1 A Customer may challenge Our365's compliance with the above principles with the Chief Information Officer or President of Hospital Operations or any other individual identified by Our365 who oversees Our365's compliance with this Privacy Policy.
