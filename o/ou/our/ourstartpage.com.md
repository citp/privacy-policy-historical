Additionally, when you enter a search query using the Site or Site Services, we will receive the query text and process it, together with the above data, to return a search results page to you. If you have modified your browser settings so that address-bar search queries and erroneous domain name system (DNS) requests are submitted to us, we may also receive any search query or misspelled URL that you enter into your browser's address bar.

Some of the foregoing information may be collected via a third party (e.g., comScore) pixel or web beacon and/or information stored in cookies. We do not link the information we store in these cookies to any personally identifiable information. 

The Site and Site Services usually do not require registration or submission of an account name or email address in order to use them.
