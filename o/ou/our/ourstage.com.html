</div>  <div class="body">
    <div class="editorial-block simple_page"><p>This Privacy Policy describes the information collection and use procedures at this website, located at OurStage.com ("Site"), owned by OurStage, Inc. This notice describes our online information collection and use practices at this Site.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	As part of our regular business conduct, and regardless of whether you have opted out of having your information shared, we share information with third parties who help us deliver your requested services. We also will share your information in the event that there is a change of corporate ownership. We may also share information with government officials in order to cooperate with a legitimate investigation.
