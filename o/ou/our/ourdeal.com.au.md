We also record other information including responses to promotions. Whenever a page is requested from our web server, we record the time, date and URL of the request, along with information on the browser software that is being used. This information is collected to provide valuable research in better understanding the preferences of our members and to enable us to better target our communications, including promotions.

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. The use of cookies on Websites is a common industry standard. Cookies act as unique identifiers, used to distinguish different members. They enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on our site. Once you log out of your browser, the cookie simply terminates. Please note that even after we have terminated a cookie, remnants of that cookie may remain on your computer. These remnants are normally inactive.

Our business partners may use cookies on the Website (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies or any information collected by these business partners. We may use cookies when we conduct voting polls, surveys, and contests to limit multiple responses and registrations. We will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent by us to you in a cookie.

As most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can modify your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. By modifying your browser, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the voting polls, surveys, contest, and game areas, will not function to their full capacity.

## Data Quality and Security of Personal Information

We take reasonable precautions to protect your security. We use encryption technology to ensure information is protected when being sent over the Internet. Unfortunately, there is always a risk involved in sending information through any channel including the Internet and you do so entirely at your own risk.

Authorised employees and contractors will have limited access to your personal information where it is necessary to enable them to perform relative functions. Buy Blinds Online and our associated agencies and companies are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us.

## Links to Third Party Websites

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.

## Notification of Changes to Privacy Policy

Any amendments to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
