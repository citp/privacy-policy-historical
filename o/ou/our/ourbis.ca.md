# Privacy policy | Ourbis

## Information collected

Ourbis collects only minimal personal information about its users. They consist in a location (through a postal code) and an email address. We also log searches performed on the site to improve our engine based on real-world usage.

## Personal information handling

User locations and email addresses are never disclosed in any way, be it to other users or third-parties. Ourbis will use email addresses sparingly to notify users of site news, and users can opt-in to receive more targeted email about local businesses.

Passwords are stored with encryption and can not be recovered by anyone, site administrators included.

## Information removal

When users delete their profile, Ourbis will keep previous contributions (descriptions, photos, reviews) as anonymous and clear personal information such as user name, location, email address and password.
