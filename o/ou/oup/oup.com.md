You may notify us either in writing or by telephone, fax or email that you object to being contacted or being contacted in a particular way. If you use more than one email address to communicate with us, please notify us of each email account you use.

### When do we share information?

We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We share your information within OUP. We also share your information with Oxford Publishing Limited, our affiliates, our licensors, our agents, our distributors and our suppliers that assist us in making our website and/or the products and services on our website available to you (e.g. our hosting supplier). 

We publish many journals on behalf of learned societies. Where you subscribe to a journal, we may share your subscription details with the society for whom we publish the journal, which they may use to invite you to join the society, or for other conferences and events organised by or for the society.

If you sign up for services that are managed or offered by other organisations, they will obtain your information.

A number of third party websites have links on our website. If you visit any of those websites, they may collect information. Such websites are not within our control and are not covered by this privacy policy. These websites may have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those policies. Please check those policies before you submit any personal data to such third party websites.

If we believe that your use of our website is unlawful or damaging to others, we reserve the right to disclose the information we have obtained through our website about you to third parties to the extent that it is reasonably necessary in our opinion to prevent, remedy or take action in relation to such conduct. 

We may also disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation; in order to enforce or apply any agreements or licences with you; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OUP, our employees, affiliates, agents, distributors, licensors, suppliers, and/or our customers. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

If any part of our business (including those of our affiliates) is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers.

### Security and Our partners outside Europe

All personal and credit card information is encoded using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology before being sent over the Internet. To protect your data further, your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a database that is away from our website database, so it is not connected to the Internet. Credit card transactions are issued a digital certificate, ensuring that your data can only be read by our transaction system as long as your browser shows its secure mode symbol (such as a key or closed lock). 

 We also recommend setting your browser's preferences to accept cookies and enable JavaScript™. 

As a major international publisher, committed to the widest possible dissemination of scholarship and learning, OUP has links with other organisations throughout the world. We exchange information with our overseas branches, associated companies and other parties, including distributors and sales agents.  As such, from time to time, we may transfer, store and/or process information about you at a destination outside of the European Economic Area. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. By using our website, you consent to these transfers. 

 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### Updating your details and contacting us

If you have any questions or queries regarding this privacy policy or if any of the information that you have provided to OUP changes e.g. if you change your e-mail address, please contact us by sending an e-mail to [privacy.uk@oup.com](mailto:privacy.uk@oup.com).

### Governing Law

You agree that this privacy policy shall be exclusively governed by the laws of England and Wales and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
