<a name="purpose"></a><b>Purpose</b><br>
<br>
In order to make your use of our Sites as worthwhile as possible, we may collect Personal Information from and about you, and we may collect certain information from your computer about you and your visits to our Sites.  “Personal Information” includes, for example, your name; home and/or business address; e-mail address; telephone, wireless, or fax number; SMS, text message, or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card and other payment information; synagogue and demographic information; and other information that may identify you as an individual or allow us to contact you online or offline.  This Privacy Policy explains, in general, what information is collected on our Sites, how that information is used, and with whom we may share such information.<br>
<b><br>
<a name="optout"></a>Right to Opt In and Opt Out</b><br>
<br>
You may have the right to “opt in” and “opt out” of certain of our uses of your Personal Information.  For example, at the time you are requested to provide Personal Information on our Sites, you may have the opportunity to elect to, or not to: (1) receive correspondence from us, or (2) have your contact information shared with other entities (outside of OU) for their marketing purposes.  You may also opt out of receiving promotional e-mails or SMS messages by clicking on an opt out link within the promotional e-mail or SMS message you receive or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:ouinternet@ou.org">ouinternet@ou.org</a> indicating which promotional e-mails or SMS messages you no longer wish to receive. <br>
<br>
Please understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us.  If you do request to have us stop sharing your personal information with such third parties for their direct marketing purposes, such request will only apply as of the date of your request, and we will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your personally identifiable information prior to such request.  In these cases, please contact that entity directly.<br>
<br>
<a name="info"></a><b>What information is collected on our Sites?<br>
<br>
User-Provided Information<br>
</b><br>
We collect Personal Information from users of our Sites, for example, when users subscribe to our newsletter(s), make online donations, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys, contribute to a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we may make available on our Sites, submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Sites, or send us an e-mail.<br>
<b><br>
Web Site Usage Information<br>
</b><br>
Cookies &amp; Web beacons:  We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.  Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies track where you travel on our Sites and what you look at and purchase.  They may store your Site preferences, username, or password for future visits.  Cookies may also enable us to relate your use of our Sites to other information about you, including your Personal Information.  All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Sites.  <br>
<br>
Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.  Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to manage Flash cookies.  However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Sites or certain areas or features of our Sites. <br>
<br>
We also may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies in our Sites or in our communications with you (such as in our e-mails), which help us to verify an individual’s viewing or receipt of a Web page or message, and may enable us to relate such viewing or receipt to other information, including Personal Information.<br>
<br>
IP Address and Clickstream Data:  When you visit our Sites, we collect your browser type and IP address.  Our servers may also record clickstream data, including: the referring page that linked you to our Sites (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Sites; the Web site you visit after our Sites; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Sites or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. <br>
<br>
Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.<br>
<b><br>
<a name="personal"></a>How is Personal Information used?</b><br>
<br>
We will use the Personal Information you provide to us on our Sites, for example, to respond to your requests, process your orders or donations, and to provide you with our product and service offerings.  We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping.  We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties. <br>
<br>
In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about programs, products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above. <br>
<br>
We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Sites and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. <br>
<b><br>
<a name="share"></a>Do we share Personal Information and Web Site Usage information with others?<br>
</b><br>
OU may share your information (including Personal Information and Non-Personal Information) with third parties in certain circumstances, including the following:<br>
<br>
When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Sites, such as our job board, the information that you submit or post will be made available to the general public.  For this reason, we recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information on these areas of our Sites.<br>
<br>
We may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other entities that have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you.  Unless you elect not to receive such offers by following the instructions in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above, we may from time to time provide your contact information to these entities so that they may send you these offers.  If you change your mind and no longer want us to share your contact information with these types of third parties, follow the instructions to opt out in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above.<br>
<br>
Some of our contests, sweepstakes and other offerings may be co-sponsored by another company.  Unless you instruct us not to by following the instructions in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above, we may share the information we obtain from you in connection with such offerings with our co-sponsor.  In those situations, our co-sponsors will have the right to use your information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies.  We are not responsible for how our co-sponsors may use your information.<br>
<br>
We may share your information with our affiliates, technical consultants, service providers, third party auditors, or other providers, vendors and third parties who use such information, on our behalf, to help provide our Sites or Services, enhance their functionality, provide associated services, process your donations and requests, or deliver content, samples, products, services, gifts and prizes.<br>
<br>
We may disclose Web Site Usage Information and other non-personally identifiable information regarding our users and user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Sites and e-mails to third parties, including, for example, aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.<br>
<br>
We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas.  We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of our Sites, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information and other information in the event we, or a substantial portion of our assets, undergo a business restructuring, transfer of ownership, or similar transaction.<br>
<b><br>
<a name="wireless"></a>Communications Sent to Wireless Devices</b><br>
<br>
In connection with our Services, we may send communications to wireless devices via e-mail or SMS.  If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages at such address unless and until you tell us that you do not want to receive such messages by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out section above.  Similarly, if you want to use our SMS services, you agree to receive SMS messages at the address or number you provide for such purposes unless and until you tell us that you do not want to receive such messages by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out section above.  You understand that your wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these communications, and that you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out section.  You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which such communications will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.  You must be 18 years of age or older and reside in the United States to use any SMS service.<br>
<br>
<a name="security"></a><b>Security<br>
</b><br>
While we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information collected via our Sites, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.<br>
<br>
In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.  If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.  You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.  If you prefer for us to use the United States Postal Service to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at ouinternet@ou.org.<br>
<br>
<a name="consent"></a><b>Consent to Processing</b><br>
<br>
By providing Personal Information to our Sites, you consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States, which may provide lesser privacy protections than the laws of other countries.<br>
<b><br>
<a name="california"></a>Your California Privacy Rights</b><br>
<br>
California law permits our users who are California residents to request certain information about our disclosure of their personal information to third parties for third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:ouinternet@ou.org">ouinternet@ou.org</a> or write to us at Orthodox Union, 11 Broadway, New York, NY 10004.<br>
<b><br>
<a name="linkedto"></a>“Linked-To” Web Sites</b><br>
<br>
Our Sites may contain links, banners, widgets or advertisements that lead to other Web sites.  When you click on these types of third-party content, the privacy policies of the Web sites to which you are linked will govern the collection and use of your information.  OU does not have access to or control over any technologies or practices that may be used on linked to sites, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of them.  We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site visited after leaving our Sites to learn about how your information is treated.<br>
<b><br>
<a name="changes"></a>Changes to this Privacy Policy<br>
</b><br>
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting to our Sites.  Under certain circumstances (for example, in connection with certain material changes), we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy Policy, or to request your consent for such changes, by additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page of our Sites or sending you an e-mail.<br>
<br>
<a name="contact"></a><b>Contact Us</b><br>
<br>
If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy practices, you may contact us at ouinternet@ou.org.<br>
