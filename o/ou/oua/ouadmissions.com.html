    <p>
        We value the trust you place in us. That's why we insist upon the highest standards
        for secure transactions and applicant information privacy. Please read the following

        sure you are aware of any changes, <strong>please review this policy periodically.</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. PAYMENT SECURITY</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and

        described to you at the time of collection.</p>
