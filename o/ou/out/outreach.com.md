**INCLUDING FOR USERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES** Outreach, Inc. and its Affiliates (" **Outreach** " or " **We** ") know that you care about how the information we receive from you is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.

By using the Sites, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy you should not use our Services.

  1. **What Types of Information Does Outreach Receive From its Users?**
    * **Personal Information.**  “ **Personal Information** ” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including: name, title, company name, job function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, physical address, email address, content you post on our Site(s) (text, images, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your e-mail address).  It can also include transaction information, such details about purchases you make through the Site(s), registrations you make through our Site(s), and billing details as well as usage information, such as information about how you use our Site(s) and interact with us. If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Site(s), you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    * **Other Information.**  “ **Other Information** ” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include, for instance, browser and device information; information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies; demographic information and other information provided by you; or aggregated information. We use this information to facilitate our operation of the Sites and for other purposes described below.
    * **IP Address.**  Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. Outreach uses IP Addresses to calculate usage levels of the Sites, help diagnose problems with its servers, administer the Sites, and monitor the regions from which you navigate to Outreach’s Sites. 
  2. **How Does Outreach Collect Information?**
**Personal Information.**  We may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:
      * **Through the Sites:**  We may collect Personal Information through the Sites, e.g., when you request a catalog, contact us, subscribe to our email newsletter, download content (e.g. free eBooks), or register to use our Sites. 
      * **Offline:**  We may collect Personal Information from you offline, such as during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact customer service.   
      * **Through You:**  Outreach may collect information such as your location or your preferred means of communication when you voluntarily provide it. It also includes feedback and correspondence, such as information you provide in your responses to surveys, when you participate in market research activities, report a problem with our Site, receive customer support or otherwise correspond with us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites. Note that there is no legal obligation for you to provide us with personal information and any information collected by us will be provided by you at your own will and with your consent. 
      * **Information From Other Sources:**  In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and services to you, we may obtain information about you from other sources such as joint marketing partners, social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.  Some of our Site(s) include interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking sites (each a “SNS”).  If you connect to a SNS through our Site you authorize us to access, use, and store the information that you agreed the SNS could provide to us based on your settings on that SNS. We will access, use, and store that information in accordance with this Notice. You can revoke our access to the information you provide in this way at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS.
**Other Information.**  We may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
      * **Through Your Browser or Device:**  Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the names(s) of the Outreach Sites you are using. 
      * **Through Cookies and Other Similar Technologies:**  Cookies and other similar technologies may be used to collect Other Information.  We use essential cookies to provide you with services available through our Site(s).  We use analytics and performance cookies to collect information about traffic to our Site(s) and how users use our Site(s).  We use social media cookies when you share information using a social media site sharing button or action. We may use third parties to serve advertisements on other websites that may be of interest to you, based on information collected about your use of our Sites and other websites.  To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags and web beacons).  Outreach does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include ‘do not track’ instructions. 
Outreach also uses a web analytics service, currently Google Analytics.   Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (" **Google** "). Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to analyze how users use the Domains. The information generated about Domain usage (including your shortened IP address) is transmitted to Google in the U.S. This information is used to evaluate visitors’ use of the Domain, compile statistical reports on Domain activity, and provide other services related to the Site and Internet use. Google may also collect information about Domain visitors’ use of other websites. For more information about Google Analytics, or to opt out of Google Analytics, please go to: [ **https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout** ](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) .

**Disabling cookies.**  You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings.  In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help,” “tools,” or “edit” facility).  Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.
