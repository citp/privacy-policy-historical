				<h1 class="headline">Vox Media <em>Privacy Policy</em></h1>
				<small>Effective November 2011</small>

      			<p>Your privacy is important to us and we have prepared this 
				Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share 
				information we obtain through your use of the Internet sites, 
				applications and services (“Services”) that are operated by, 
				controlled by or are affiliate with Vox Media, Inc., including 
				without limitation SB Nation and The Verge (collectively, “we,” 
				“us” or “our”). This Privacy Policy does not govern our use of 
				any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, 
				or communicate with us in any manner other than through the 
				Services. Because the Internet is global, information about you 
				that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, 
				processed in, and held in countries (including the United 
				States) other than the one in which you reside. <strong>By using 
				the Services, you explicitly consent to such use of your 
				information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>
					<h3>Information We Automatically Collect.</h3>
					<p>We automatically collect certain information to help us 
					understand how our users use the Services (which we will 
					refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as <strong>
					“Usage Data”</strong>). For example, each time you visit the 
					Services we may automatically collect your IP address, 
					browser and computer type, access time, the Web page you 
					came from, the URL you go to next, and the Web page(s) that 
					you access during your visit.</p>
					<p>We will use such Usage Data to diagnose problems with our 
					servers and software, to administer the Services, and to 
					gather demographic information. Our third-party advertising 
					networks and servers will also provide us reports that will 
					tell us how many ads were presented and clicked on the 
					Services in a manner that does not identify personally any 
					individual.</p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Information You Choose To Submit.</h3>
					<p>You can visit the Services without telling us who you are 
					or revealing any information by which someone could 
					personally identify you (which we will refer to in this 
					Privacy Policy collectively as <strong>“Personal 
					Information”</strong>). If, however, you wish to register to 
					become a member of the Services, you are required to provide 
					certain Personal Information (e.g., your name and e-mail 
					address), and we ask that you also provide a user name and 
					password. We use your Personal Information to fulfill your 
					requests for products and services, to improve our Services, 
					and to contact you from time to time about us, and our 
					products and services. You may also choose to submit 
					additional information about yourself (for example your 
					gender, birth date, or zip code) by which someone could not 
					personally identify you (which we will refer to in this 
					Privacy Policy collectively as <strong>“Non-Personal 
					Information”</strong>). We may also collect additional 
					information about you when you visit certain features of the 
					Services or the pages of certain of our partners when you 
					interact with offers and advertisements, when you contact us 
					for support, when you log into the Services with your 
					account, when you complete a survey, or when you enter 
					promotions. Finally, you may choose to submit your alias, 
					bio, email, photos or any other information that you would 
					like to share with other users of the Services (which we 
					will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as <strong>
					“Shared Information”</strong>).</p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Our Information Sharing Practices</h3>
					<p><strong>(a) Generally.</strong> Except as otherwise 
					described in this section of our Privacy Policy, we will 
					never share your Usage Data, Personal Information, 
					Non-Personal Information, or Shared Information (which we 
					will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as “User 
					Information”) with any third party without your permission.</p>
					<p><strong>(b) Advertisers.</strong> From time to time, we 
					may share your Usage Data and Non-Personal Information to 
					enable third parties who serve advertisements on the 
					Services to deliver advertisements that will be relevant to 
					you. We will not share any such information, however, in a 
					manner that would enable the advertiser to personally 
					identify you.</p>
					<p><strong>(c) Aggregated Data.</strong> From time to time, 
					we may share aggregated User Information with third parties. 
					We will not share any aggregated data, however, in manner 
					that would enable the recipient to personally identify you.</p>
					<p><strong>(d) Service Providers.</strong> From time to 
					time, we may enter into relationships with third parties who 
					provide services to us (e.g., data management and storage 
					services or credit card processing services). In those 
					circumstances, we disclose User Information that is 
					necessary for such service providers to perform those 
					services and require that they maintain the confidentiality 
					of such User Information.</p>
					<p><strong>(e) Other Disclosure Scenarios.</strong> 
					Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the 
					contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly 
					authorize us, to share any User Information: (1) in response 
					to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to 
					establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend 
					against legal claims; (2) if we believe it is necessary in 
					order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding 
					illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential 
					threats to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we 
					believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take 
					action regarding significant abuse of the Services’ 
					infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as 
					voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts 
					to compromise the security of information); (4) to our 
					parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other 
					companies under common control with us (in which case we 
					will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); 
					and (5) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity.</p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Public Information.</h3>
					<p>If you identify any User Information as public, you are 
					authorizing us to share such information publicly. For 
					example, you may elect to make certain Shared Information 
					(such as your alias, bio, email or photos) publicly 
					available. Also, there may be areas of the Services (e.g., 
					message boards, discussion rooms, and other online forums) 
					in which you are able to post information that will be 
					available to all other users of the Services. By choosing to 
					use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may 
					access, use, and disclose any information that you post to 
					those areas.</p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Cookies.</h3>
					<p>We may set and access cookies on your computer. Upon your 
					first visit to the Services, a cookie is sent to your 
					computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" 
					is a small file containing a string of characters that is 
					sent to your computer and stored on your hard drive when you 
					visit a website. Many major Web services use cookies to 
					provide useful features for their users. Each web site can 
					send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are 
					initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your 
					browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie 
					is being sent; however if you reject cookies, you will not 
					be able to sign in to the Services or take full advantage of 
					our Services.</p>
					<p>We uses cookies for the following general purposes: (a) 
					to track your preferences, such as the address or local zip 
					code you enter; (b) to access your information when you sign 
					in so we can provide you with your personalized content; (c) 
					to display the most appropriate advertisements, based on 
					your interests and activity on our Services; and (d) to help 
					us improve the Services by analyzing and estimating our 
					traffic and use of features on the Services.</p>
					<p>We may also use "pixel tags," which are small graphic 
					files that allow us to monitor the use of the Services. A 
					pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of 
					the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag 
					appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; 
					the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel 
					tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel 
					tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously 
					placed by that server on your computer.</p>
					<p>We may use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our 
					third party advertisers and ad networks, to collect 
					information about your visit, including the pages you view, 
					the links you click and other actions taken in connection 
					with our sites and Services and use them in combination with 
					our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to 
					you. </p>
					<p>We also may allow certain analytic services and providers 
					of applications used on the Services (e.g., sharing buttons) 
					to collect Non-Personally Identifiable information by 
					placing cookies on the Services that will track certain 
					performance of our Services, such as, web traffic, click-throughs, 
					etc., in order to assist us and our service providers in 
					better understanding the interests of our users and to 
					better serve those interests.</p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Advertising.</h3>
					<p>We may use other companies under agreements with us to 
					serve advertisements when you visit and use the Services. 
					These companies may collect and use click stream 
					information, browser type, time and date, subject of 
					advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits 
					to the Services and other Web sites in order to provide 
					advertisements about goods and services likely to be of 
					greater interest to you. These companies typically use a 
					cookie, a third party web beacon and/or pixel tags to 
					collect this information. None of them collect any personal 
					information from your computer, such as your e-mail address. 
					Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their 
					own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other 
					companies do not have access to our cookies. </p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Targeted Advertising.</h3>
					<p>In order to serve offers and advertisements that may be 
					interest to our users, we may display targeted 
					advertisements on the Services based on Personal Information 
					provided by our users, including zip code and profile. We do 
					not provide this Personal Information to our advertisers 
					when you interact with such an advertisement. However, 
					please note that the advertisers (including ad serving 
					companies) may determine based on their own analysis that a 
					user who interacts with an advertisement targeted by us may 
					fit into a certain demographic category; for example, an 
					advertiser may determine that men ages 25-34 are interacting 
					with a certain advertisement on the Services from a 
					particular geographic area. </p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Your Options and Information about Advertisers and 
					Targeted Ads.</h3>
					<p>You can learn more about the advertising companies we 
					work with and what options they may offer you regarding 
					cookies and targeted advertising by clicking
					<a href="http://www.sbnation.com/guide/privacy_advertising">
					here</a>. Many of these companies are also members of the 
					Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising 
					Alliance, which each provide a simple way to opt-out of ad 
					targeting from participating companies. </p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Mobile.</h3>
					<p>We may from time to time offer certain location or 
					pinpoint based services with our applications (such as, GPS 
					assisted navigation instruction, wireless tower location, 
					triangulation or other available location technologies). If 
					you elect to use such location based services, we must 
					periodically receive your location in order to provide such 
					location-based services to you. By using the applications’

					your hardware; (b) record, compile and display your 
					location; and (c) publish your location to third parties 
					designated by you by means of location publication controls 
					available within the applications (e.g., settings, user 
					preferences). As part of the applications, we may also 
					collect and store certain information about our users, such 
					as, users' wireless mobile subscriber ISDN and/or IMEI 
					numbers (as applicable) and users' network access identifier 
					information. This information will be used to provide you 
					the services accessed through our applications. We may use 
					third party providers to help provide services through 
					mobile systems and such providers may use the information in 
					accordance with our Privacy Policy.  </p></li>

					<p>We offer you the opportunity to choose not to receive 
					communications from us. If you would like to take advantage 
					of this opportunity, please let us know by accessing and 
					updating your profile. Please note that sometimes these 
					requests may take up to ten business days to process and 
					that we are not responsible for removing information about 
					you from the database of any third party to whom we were 
					authorized to disclose your User Information prior to 
					processing your request. Even if you do take advantage of 
					this opportunity, we reserve the right to send you 
					administrative messages relating to the Services (e.g., 
					about changes to this Privacy Policy) and to contact you 
					regarding any goods or services you have ordered.</p></li>
					<li>
					<h3>Modifying and Deleting Your Personal Information. </h3>
					<p>If you would like to modify or delete from our database 
					any User Information you previously submitted to us, please

					are required to do so by law.</p></li>

					in which we treat your User Information, we will inform you 
					of such change via email or by posting a notice on relevant
