How we use the information you provide at our request

Information you provide at our request is used to contact you to confirm a reservation, confirm receipt of a contest entry, or contact you in the event there are questions about any information you submit to us.

We may occasionally notify you of new developments at Outrigger, including new resort openings, new guest services, and seasonal specials. If you do not want to receive any unsolicited announcements from Outrigger, we ask that you indicate this preference when you respond to our request for personal information or please [click to send us an email](mailto:webmaster@outrigger.com).

Outrigger provides aggregated site statistics to interested parties which do not contain any of the information you provide at our request.

Information we automatically collect and how we use that information

Like many other websites we automatically collect and analyze other information including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our website, including date and time. We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to our web sites. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to our site and will not sell or rent this information to any third parties, except that we may share just your IP address (i.e. with no other identifying information) with advertising partners so that they can display an Outrigger advertisement when you visit the websites of those partners.

Our website may use "Cookies" or "Other Technologies" (such as "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar technologies) to help us and third parties obtain information about your visits to the Site, deliver online and mobile ads and content for us and others specific to your interests, process your reservations or requests, and/or to analyze your visiting patterns.

When you visit our web sites, you will be assigned a persistent "cookie" (a small text file) to be stored on your computer's hard drive. The purpose of the cookie is to identify you when you visit our site so we can enhance and customize your online experience.

You can choose to visit our web sites without cookies, but without these identifying files you will not be able to take advantage of certain desirable features of our site, including providing a more personalized online experience.

Again, please check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to delete cookies using your browser. 

This web site may from time to time offer "web widgets". Some widgets support functions that may require that you to disclose certain personally identifiable information given your choice of participation. This information is collected in many different ways such as: forms, surveys, contests, forums, subscribing or unsubscribing to mailings and correcting or updating personally identifiable information and are only used for the purpose in which they were collected. Some widgets may utilize an optional import contacts feature to help you invite your contacts to download our widget.

This web site may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features may be transmitted to the Social Media Company and are governed by that company's privacy policy and terms of use.

We use various web site analytics tools and technologies regarding activities on our website that require storage of web session data. The overall aim of these tools is to learn about how the Site is used, to improve the experience of users of the Site and to proactively identify and correct error conditions. These tools and technologies are also used to assist website visitors who report problems in the use of our website. Stored web session data is never sold or rented to third parties and is purged when these purposes have been fulfilled.

Additional State of California do-not-track disclosures

While you can choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising on our website based on your activity across websites, at this time, we do not respond to browser “do-not-track” signals or other similar mechanisms.

Third Party information and services and tools

Personal Information From Children

How is your information protected?

Outrigger does not lease, sell, trade or give any of our customer information to other companies except for sharing just your IP address with one of our advertising partners so that Outrigger advertising displays when you visit those partner’s websites.  If you do not want us to provide any of your information to a third party, we ask that you indicate this preference where personal information is requested.  Or please send us an email at webmaster@outrigger.com.

We use generally accepted standards governing administrative, technical and physical measures to protect your personal information.  For example, credit card information provided through our online reservations forms or merchandise order form is encrypted and measures have been taken to secure our server from any unauthorized access.  Despite these measures, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from us via the Site by Internet or email cannot be guaranteed.

We recommend that any communications you send us via this site, including comments, suggestions and questions, not contain information that is private or confidential. Credit card information should only be provided on the online reservations or merchandise order forms that encrypt the number for your protection.  While we take reasonable measures to protect your privacy, Outrigger and companies linked to our site do not guarantee and are under no obligation to protect any private or confidential information you choose to provide in an unsecured or unencrypted manner.

We will not contact you by mobile/text messaging or email to ask for your confidential personal information or credit card details.
