We limit the processing of Personal Data of persons in the EU (“EU Personal Data") to that which is relevant for the purposes of the particular processing. We do not process EU Personal Data in ways that are inconsistent with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by you.

In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data we process is (i) reliable for its intended use, and (ii) accurate, complete and current. In this regard, we rely on you to update and correct EU Personal Data to the extent necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized. You may contact us at [privacy@outerknown.com](mailto:privacy@outerknown.com) to request that we update or correct relevant EU Personal Data. Subject to applicable law, we retain EU Personal Data in a form that identifies or renders you identifiable only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or subsequently authorized by you.

If we decide to process EU Personal Data for purposes other than what is necessary to provide services to you or where we believe that your interests may override ours, persons in the EU will receive a notice detailing:

  1. the type of Personal Data to be processed;
  2. the purpose for the processing and a description of how the processing is based on legitimate interests;
  3. the categories of recipients of disclosures of the Personal Data;
  4. the period for which the Personal Data will be stored or the criteria for determining the period;
  5. how Customers and Site Visitors can exercise the rights of access, correction, erasure, objection, and the right to withdraw consent;

  7. whether the Customer or Site Visitor is obliged to provide the data by statute, contract, or for another reason, and the possible consequences of failing to provide the data; and
  8. whether the Personal Data will be subject to automated processing and, if so, the logic and the consequences of the processing for the data subject.



Such notices will be clear, conspicuous, and readily available to affected EU Persons. A notice will require an unambiguous, affirmative, opt-in consent to the particular use or processing of the EU Personal Data.

With respect to transfers of your Personal Data to third-party data processors, we will:

  1. enter into a contract with each relevant data processor,
  2. transfer Personal Data to each such data processor only for limited and specified purposes,
  3. ascertain that the data processor is obligated to provide the Personal Data with at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by applicable law,
  4. take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the data processor effectively processes the Personal Data in a manner consistent with our obligations under applicable law,
  5. require the data processor to notify us if the data processor determines that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by our contract or applicable law,
  6. upon notice, including under (e) above, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing of the Personal Data by the data processor.

Other reasons for denying requests or limiting access include (i) interference with the execution or enforcement of the law or with private causes of action, including the prevention, investigation, or detection of offenses; (ii) breaching a legal or other professional privilege or obligation; (iii) prejudicing security investigations or grievance proceedings or in connection with succession planning and corporate re-organizations.
