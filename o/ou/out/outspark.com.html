    <p><b>OUTSPARK Privacy Policy</b></p><p>
</p><u>
Contents</u><p>
</p><p>
This policy covers how OUTSPARK, Inc. ("OUTSPARK") treats personal information that OUTSPARK collects and receives, including information related to your past use of OUTSPARK products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p><p>
</p><u>
Information Collection and Use</u><p>
</p><p>
OUTSPARK collects personal information when you register with OUTSPARK, when you use OUTSPARK products or services, and when you visit OUTSPARK pages or the pages of certain OUTSPARK partners. OUTSPARK may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.</p><p>
</p><p>
When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, age range, zip code, etc. Once you register with OUTSPARK and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.</p><p>
</p><p>
OUTSPARK collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners.</p><p>
</p><p>
OUTSPARK automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, OUTSPARK cookie information, and the page you request.</p><p>
</p><p>
OUTSPARK uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p><p>
</p><p>
If you elect to use OUTSPARK’s referral service for informing a friend about our site or particular features or content, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. OUTSPARK will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit OUTSPARK. OUTSPARK stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p><p>
</p><p>
When purchasing game items or subscriptions to our games, you will have the choice to pay by credit card, Paypal, mobile phone, bill to your home phone or ISP or any other e-commerce available today or in the future. We will collect the required information for each payment method and will pass it on to the payment processor as necessary to complete the transaction, however, we will otherwise keep this information confidential.</p><p>
</p><u>
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:<p></p></u><p><u>
</u></p><p>
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain personal information at our website from those we actually know are under 13. We ask users, before providing personal information, to confirm their age. Anyone who identifies themselves as being under age 13 will be restricted from accessing or using any of our products or services that require them to enter additional personal information. They may access portions of our websites without additional personal information being collected.</p><p>
</p><p>
If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to OUTSPARK, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. OUTSPARK will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived in web logs and back-up archives after OUTSPARK deletes the information from its active database.</p><p>
</p><p>
OUTSPARK believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.</p><p>
</p><u>
Information Sharing and Disclosure</u><p>
</p><p>
OUTSPARK does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p><p>
</p><p>
* We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with OUTSPARK under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help OUTSPARK communicate with you about offers from OUTSPARK and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</p><p>
</p><p>
* We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p><p>
</p><p>
* We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of OUTSPARK's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p><p>
</p><p>
* We transfer information about you if OUTSPARK is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, OUTSPARK will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><p>
</p><u>
Passive Means To Collect Information</u><p>
</p><p>
To permit your efficient use of our websites, products and services, OUTSPARK uses cookies (small files stored in your computer), which let us know how you accessed us and let us know that you are a prior customer (so that you will not have to re-enter all of the information previously provided to us every time you access our sites).</p><p>
</p><p>
OUTSPARK (or third parties on our behalf) may also use web beacons, which are transparent images that have been placed on a web page or an e-mail message, and send a signal that allows us to determine when a page has been visited, or an e-mail opened. Web beacons do not contain or collect personal information. The information that we do collect is used to allow us to better understand our customers' usage patterns, and to help us determine how they accessed our website(s). This information, in turn, allows us to improve our products to better meet your needs, and to enhance our communications with you.</p><p>
</p><u>
Communications from OUTSPARK</u><p>
</p><p>
For everyone 13 years of age and over, certain communications from OUTSPARK, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the OUTSPARK Newsletter, are considered part of OUTSPARK membership and you may not opt out of receiving them. In particular those who register with us for beta testing OUTSPARK' games agree to receive communications regarding these games as a part of their beta membership.</p><p>
</p><p>
All other emails from OUTSPARK will be strictly 'opt-in' communications, and will include a URL or email address where you can unsubscribe from future mailings.</p><p>
</p><p>
You can change your personal information or delete your OUTSPARK account by visiting your Account page.</p><p>
</p><u>
Our Commitment To Data Security</u><p>
</p><p>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p><p>
</p><u>
Changes to this Privacy Policy</u><p>
</p><p>
OUTSPARK may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the email address specified in your OUTSPARK account, if we have collected it, or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p><p>
</p><u>
How To Contact Us</u><p>
