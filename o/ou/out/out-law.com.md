# Privacy

_This policy was last updated in November 2013._

**Safeguarding your rights**

Out-Law.com is part of international law firm [Pinsent Masons](http://www.pinsentmasons.com/). The privacy of our users is important to us and we take care to safeguard it. This policy explains how we use your personal information and elaborates on our [Data Protection notice](http://www.pinsentmasons.com/en/legal-notices/privacy-policy/).

**What information do we collect?**

When you register as a user of our site, to attend our events or receive emails from us, we will collect the information necessary to provide these services to you.  As a minimum, we will require your name, e-mail address, country and the organisation you work for. If you are registered with us, you can revisit your My Out-Law profile at any time to amend these details or to provide additional details .

We will also collect information from you if you complete any other forms on our site or if you contact us with comments or specific requests.

**What do we use personal information for?**

We want to provide a service which is personalised to each of our visitors. We also want to give you control of what you receive as a result of registering with Out-Law.com. This will enable us to improve your Out-law experience and, by sharing this information with your contacts at Pinsent Masons and their support teams, improve the legal services provided to you. We also find it useful to know what information is useful to what kinds of people so will use data collected to find that out and use that knowledge to improve our services. We will never pass your information to third parties, other than to our carefully selected service providers (upon whom we will impose strict contractual requirements) or where permitted or required by law.

**Pinsent Masons eNewsletter, incorporating Out-Law News**

If you decide you would like to receive our weekly eNewsletter you will receive this e-mail once per week only.

**Contacting you for other purposes**

We will contact you about other Pinsent Masons' events and services from time to time by email, telephone, fax or other electronic messaging service,  but only if you choose to provide these contact details and request that we contact you about events and services by ticking the relevant box in your profile or ticking the relevant box on the seminar booking form. Wherever possible, we will only contact you with information about events and services that, based on your preference settings, we believe will be of interest to you. We may contact you occasionally about our surveys, special offers or competitions; but  **we will never bombard you with rubbish**.

Another box lets Pinsent Masons' business partners also contact you. You don't have to tick this box. If you do, please be aware that any such third parties will be carefully selected: we will always be cautious about letting anyone else contact you – so ticking this box does not mean that we would sell your email address to spammers.

**Information collected automatically**

We automatically collect information about your visit to our site. This information is used to make your visit to our site more efficient, and to help us follow browsing preferences on our site so that we can make regular improvements and so that we can determine what subjects are of most interest to particular groups of users. Our external web host may also automatically log your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device.

**Cookies**

**How Out-Law uses cookies on its sites**

Cookies are small text files that can be used by web sites to make a user's experience more efficient. This site uses different types of cookie. We use cookies to remember your preference settings and login details. 

If you are a user of My Out-Law then cookies will remember your identity to help deliver the My Out-Law service. Cookies will also track what content you use, as described in the text shown to you when you signed up to the service and in the 'What do we use personal information for?' section above. This helps us to understand our users' needs and helps us to improve Out-Law.com. 

We also use Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.  **Google Analytics uses cookies**  to help us to analyse how users use the site. Our own publishing system also uses cookies to collect and report to us information about how users use the site.   **[Learn more](http://www.out-law.com/cookie-settings/) **about our use of cookies. 

**Transferring information overseas**

Outside the UK, Pinsent Masons has offices in Dubai, Doha, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Paris, Munich, and Istanbul. It is possible therefore that your details or information collected may be available to these offices.  However, we have taken all steps necessary to ensure that your information is adequately protected where it is transferred to a jurisdiction whose data protection laws are not as strict as the UK.

**Information requests**

You can ask for a copy of the information we hold about you at any time (for which we may charge a small fee). We will also correct any inaccuracies in your information at your request.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

If we make changes to our Privacy Policy that affect how we handle your data, we will let you know by email. Minor changes will not be notified. You can check our Privacy Policy at this page at any time. It was last updated in November 2013.
