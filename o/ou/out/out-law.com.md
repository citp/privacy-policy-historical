Privacy Policy  
  
safeguarding your rights

OUT-LAW.COM is part of international law firm [Pinsent Masons](http://www.pinsentmasons.com/). The privacy of our users is important to us and we take care to safeguard it. This policy explains how we use your personal information. 

If you have any queries concerning your personal information or any questions on our use of the information, please contact our site editor, [Struan Robertson](mailto:Struan.Robertson@out-law.com)

 _What information do we collect?_

When you register as a user, we will collect the information necessary to provide the service which includes, as a minimum, your name and an e-mail address. You will also be asked to provide your company name and address, but you can register without providing these details. 

We will also collect information from you if you complete any other forms on our site or if you contact us with comments or specific requests. 

**_What do we use personal information for?_**

We provide a service which is personalised to each of our visitors. We will conduct market research surveys and may run competitions. We or other carefully selected third parties may provide you with information and details of products and services relevant to your business.

The registration form will give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such information. You can also check or change your preference at any time via your profile [profile](https://web.archive.org/php/reRegister.php?area=general).

 ** _E-mail messages_**

If you decide you would like to receive our OUT-LAW News weekly round-up, you will receive this e-mail once per week only. If this is sponsored by one of our approved third parties then their details will also appear on the e-mail. 

You may also receive occasional e-mail messages from OUT-LAW.COM on matters which we think may be of interest to you. We promise never to bombard you with rubbish.

 ** _Information collected automatically_**

We automatically collect information about your visit to our site. This information is used to make your visit to our site more efficient, and to help us follow browsing preferences on our site so that we can make regular improvements. 

**_Transferring information overseas_**

Outside the UK, Pinsent Masons has offices in Dublin, Brussels, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. It is possible that your details or information collected may be passed to these offices - but only where we think this may be of benefit to you. Note, however, that although privacy safeguards will apply within Pinsent Masons, countries outside the European Economic Area do not always provide the the same level of data protection as the UK. 

**_Cookies_**

Cookies are small text files that can be used by web sites to make a user's experience more efficient. 

Once you register with OUT-LAW.COM, we offer you a cookie to save your log in details. This means you will not need to use your username and password to access our content when using the computer on which the cookie is stored. However, you will still need to use your username and password to access your profile. The cookie file does not store your personal information.

More information about cookies, including how to block them and/or delete them, can be found at [AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).
