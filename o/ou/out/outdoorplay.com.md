Our site is 100% SECURE so your personal information is completely safe. Outdoorplay uses state-of-the-art Internet encryption technology to ensure that the transmission of your personal and payment information is secure.

## Credit Card Security

Your credit card security is a priority at Outdoorplay. We guarantee the safety and confidentiality of every transaction we process. If any unauthorized charge appears on your credit card, you will pay nothing. This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology to encrypt your name, address, and credit card number, so that your personal data cannot be accessed while traveling over the Internet.
