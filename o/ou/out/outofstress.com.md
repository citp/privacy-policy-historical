Welcome to the Privacy Policy of *Outofstress.com. The privacy of our website visitors is very important to us, and we are committed to safeguarding it. This policy explains what personal information we connect, what we collect it for and how we safeguard this information.

## What information we collect

Depending on how you interact with our site, we might collect some personal information from you. The following is the type of data we collect and why we collect it.

These details are pseudonimyzed (cannot directly identify you) and are collected for the purpose of delivering relevant content and ads and operating and improving our Service (including services from our partners).

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <https://automattic.com/privacy/>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

We may use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.

### 2\. Tracking & Cookies Data

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

Examples of Cookies we use:

**session cookies** (we use these cookies to operate our Service) and **preference cookies** (we use these cookies to remember your preferences and various settings).

**We use cookies for the following purposes:**
