# Privacy Policy | Outdoorphoto

Outdoorphoto takes privacy and transparency very seriously. We respect your privacy and will take all reasonable measures to protect it, as more fully detailed below. 

## When do we collect data from our customers?

By using this website or communicating with any of our personnel, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. 

## What data do we collect from our customers?

Should a user decide to register as a user on the website, the user gives explicit consent to process personally identifiable information that includes but is not limited to the user’s:

  * name and surname
  * date of birth
  * gender
  * email address
  * contact number
  * physical/delivery address
  * business VAT number
  * general interests
  * location data
  * identification number (ODP rental clients)



You may choose to provide additional personal information to us, in which event you agree to provide accurate and current information, and not to impersonate or misrepresent any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with anyone or anything.

## What do we do with your data and why?

The information you provide is used to fulfil your specific request and for statistical purposes only, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example, to add you to one of our mailing lists.

Note that the processing of customers’ personal data is required to fulfil contractual purposes such as shipping a product and sending order status update mailers, and for legal and accounting reasons such as tax auditing. We gather this data when a customer registers as a user on our website, subscribes to a mailer, or purchases a product both in-store and online.  


## How long do we keep your data for?

Retaining personal data depends on the purpose for which it was obtained and its nature. We shall store data for as long as the user can be considered a customer. Upon request, we will delete user information, noting the consequences of such action, for example, not receiving order status and shipping updates.

## Who do we share your data with?

We will ensure that all of our employees, third party service providers, divisions and partners (including their employees and third party service providers) having access to your personal information are bound by appropriate and legally binding confidentiality and non-use obligations (save as permitted herein) in relation to your personal information.

We are entitled to use or disclose your personal information if such use or disclosure is required in order to comply with any applicable law, an order of a court or legal process served on us, or to protect and defend our rights or property.

You may find third party links on our site. These are links to resources that we believe may be useful, however, they are operated by third parties that operate under different privacy policies. Any third party website on our site has a privacy policy. We encourage you to review those privacy policies, as we have no control over the information you may submit to those third parties.

 **Our website plugins include:**

  * OpenCart for order and accounting purposes.
  * Sage Pastel for order and accounting purposes.
  * The VCS payment gateway processes secure payments and complies with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Outdoorphoto does not log or store the card’s CVC number, rendering it impossible to obtain full card details from the VCS system that could be used for fraudulent activities. We do not store your full card information anywhere on our system.
  * Novtel for rental order purposes.
  * Shipping extensions (couriers) to calculate shipping rates, print shipping labels and ship products.

    * Google Conversion Tracking: Anonymously tracks the conversion of Google AdWords and Display Marketing into successful sales to optimise marketing efforts and advert placement that is better suited to user interests and preferences.
    * Facebook Pixel: Tracks user interaction with our website to optimise Facebook advert placement that is better suited to user interests and preferences.
    * MailChimp Mailer Interaction: Tracks user interaction with marketing emails sent to optimise direct marketing efforts and provide users with a better direct marketing experience.
