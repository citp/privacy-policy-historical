# OutboundEngine Privacy Policy

## What This Privacy Policy Covers

OutboundEngine is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This policy covers how OutboundEngine treats personal information that OutboundEngine collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy covers the information practices of OutboundEngine, including any OutboundEngine web sites that link to this Privacy Statement.

OutboundEngine’s Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. OutboundEngine is not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other Web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.

## Information Collection and Use

OutboundEngine collects personal information when you register with OutboundEngine, when you request information or use OutboundEngine products or services, and when you visit certain OutboundEngine pages or the pages of certain OutboundEngine partners.

When you register or fill out our order form, we ask for information such as your name, email address, and payment information. Once you register with OutboundEngine and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. The information you provide to OutboundEngine is used to provide services to you and for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. OutboundEngine uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications of prospective Customers and to collect payment for the Service.

OutboundEngine reserves the right to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, OutboundEngine cookie information, and the page you request.

OutboundEngine uses information for the following general purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, customize the advertising and content you see, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external purposes.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

OutboundEngine does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information to trusted suppliers and partners who work on behalf of or with OutboundEngine under confidentiality agreements. These companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of OutboundEngine’ Service Terms, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if OutboundEngine is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, OutboundEngine will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



## Cookies and Other Information Gathering Tools

OutboundEngine may set and access OutboundEngine cookies on your computer. OutboundEngine reserves the right to use web beacons to access OutboundEngine cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with OutboundEngine products and services.

As is the case with most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Your Ability to Edit Your Account Information and Preferences

You can edit your OutboundEngine account by sending an e-mail to [support@outboundengine.com](mailto:support@outboundengine.com) and requesting your account to be deleted. If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. These can be done through [support@outboundengine.com](mailto:support@outboundengine.com). OutboundEngine reserves the right to keep transaction related information for record keeping purposes.

## Special Offers

OutboundEngine sends all new service subscribers a welcoming email to verify password and username. Subscribers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Each email will include the option to unsubscribing to the email list so that you will not receive these types of communications.

## Service Announcements

From time to time it may be necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement (e.g. if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email). Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, however, these communications are not promotional in nature.

## Customer Service

We communicate with users via email or other means on a regular basis to provide the subscribed services and to address any issues relating to your account.

## Confidentiality and Security

We limit access to personal information about you to employees or suppliers who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We take every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number),that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to individuals who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) and, as a result, are granted access to personally identifiable information. OutboundEngine requires use of password-protected screen-savers and ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Furthermore, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

OutboundEngine may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your OutboundEngine account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
