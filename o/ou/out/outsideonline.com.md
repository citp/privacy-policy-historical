### Controlling Our Use of Tracking Technologies

You may control our use of cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You can configure your browser to reject browser cookies. To find out more about how to enable, disable, or delete cookies from your web browsers, click [here](http://optout.aboutads.info/). To control flash cookies, click [here](https://www.tacobell.com/legal-notices/%E2%80%9Dhttp:/www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html%E2%80%9D). Why? Because flash cookies do not reside in your browser, and thus your browser settings will not affect them. If you configure your computer to block cookies, you may not be able to access certain functionality on our platforms.

### Our Do-Not-Track Policy

Some web browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our platforms may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop. Options you select are browser and device specific.

### We engage in interest-based advertising.

We and our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple platforms or devices.

Interest-based advertising (or “online behavioral advertising”) includes ads served to you after you leave our platform, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities. These ads might be served on websites or on apps. They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or other companies’ products.

### How do we gather relevant information about you for interest-based advertising?

To decide what is relevant to you, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others. We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.

### Opting Out of Receiving Seeing Tracking-Based Ads

The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. If you want to opt out from participating companies, visit this page. Choices you make are both browser- and device-specific.

Some of the tracking technologies we may use do not participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This means you will not be opted out by following the instructions above. Instead, see the chart above to get more information about how to opt out of that tracker’s cookies.

The Digital Advertising Alliance also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising. To exercise choice for companies participating in this tool, download the AppChoices app [here](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices).

If you opt out of online behavioral advertising (or interest-based advertising) or reject cookies, this will not stop you from seeing advertising—this will just not be tailored to your interests and therefore is less likely to be relevant to you.

Certain choices you make are both browser- and device-specific.
