This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and transfer the information you provide when you interact with us including (but not limited to) via our websites and downloadable applications that link to this policy ("online services").

This policy also tells you how we use tracking technologies, cookies and browsing data we collect from your use of the online services, the measures we take to protect the security of the information you provide to us through the online services, and how you can contact us if you have any questions regarding the online services (including if you want to unsubscribe from our services or update your contact details).

* ## SCOPE AND CONSENT

When you use the online services, you are contracting with Outer Places, LLC. If you reside outside of the United States, Outer Places, LLC is your data controller. By using the online services, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

* ## TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Our goal is to collect and use information to deliver effective and personalized services which take your interests and preferences into account, as well as for our legitimate business needs and interests.

There are two main types of information we collect about users of our online services that include (but are not limited to) the following:

  * Information that identifies you: This is commonly referred to as "personal information" and includes, for example, information that you provide to us such as your name, home address, age, gender, telephone number, e¬mail address, payment information (including your credit card number), and/or photos or video footage of you; and

  * Information that relates to you, but on its own does not identify you: Such as information about your Internet connection, the equipment you use to access our online services and information relating to your usage of those services.




There are six main categories of information we collect about users of our online services users that include (but are not limited to) the following:

  * Contact/Registration information: for example, your telephone number or e¬mail address, where you have subscribed to a service such as program updates; name, age, gender or interests when you register for an account on one of our online services; delivery address where you are buying a product or service through an online service; or your age, location, e-mail address or delivery address if you choose to enter a competition or sweepstakes offered through the online services.

  * Information that you provide on message boards and other user forums: including your username, e-mail address, images or videos. Please use caution when posting to messages boards or other forums, as information posted to these portions of the online services is public information.

  * Information about your interactions with the online services: for example, your Internet protocol or (IP) address, pages that you visit within the online services, gameplay data or other information collected through Cookies and Tracking Technologies

If you don’t want a social network to collect the information about you as described above, or you don’t want to a social network to share it with us and other third parties, please review the privacy settings and instructions of the applicable social network before you visit and use our online services.




We may also receive other information (e.g., content viewed and information about the advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with the online services. You agree that we may share information concerning your content consumption and video viewing with, or obtain information about your content consumption and video viewing from, analytics providers and advertising partners and third-party social media sites unless you withdraw your consent. The information we have access to from the third-party services varies by service and is controlled by your privacy settings on that service and by your consent. Information that may be passed to analytics providers and advertising partners may be done so via cookies and tracking technologies. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Outer Places, LLC account and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store information from third-party services in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

* ## Definitions

**Cookies**

Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies or HTML5 cookies on your device, some parts of our online services may not function properly, and that when you revisit our online service your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

**Web Beacons**

Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the online service, to monitor how users navigate the online services, to count how many e­mails we sent that were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

**Embedded Script**

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the online service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the online service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

**ETag, or entity tag**

A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of device identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
