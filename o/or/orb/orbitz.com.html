In response to such  request, Orbitz and/or its providers will give access to all the  information you provide at the time of making the booking to the  applicable government agencies of the countries to or from which you are  traveling.</p>

<p><strong><a name="p6"></a>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we retain and store Personal information</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>My Trips and My Account</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Member, we store your Personal Information in My Trips  and My Account. You can access My Trips and My Account from the <a href="http://www.orbitz.com/" target="_blank">home page</a> of our Site, after logging onto our Site. My Trips contains information  about your current, canceled or past trips. My Account contains your  name, e-mail address, e-mail and password settings, and departure city  from which you usually travel. It may also contain other information so  that you do not need to re-enter it each time you Book a Product or  Service. For example, My Account may contain your billing information  unless you tell us not to store it. It may also contain your preferences  for seat selection or special meals, details about your participation  in loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers and  other travel preferences. We also keep in My Account all other  information that you have elected to provide us, such as gender,  activities and lifestyle preferences and favorite destinations.</p>
<p>You can access, modify or close your account&nbsp;as described in <a href="#p8">How to access, modify, or close your account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties’ Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We will retain in your My&nbsp;Account, the Personal Information of  individuals for whom you have made reservations or to whom we have sent  Orbitz Care Alerts on your behalf.</p>
<p>You can access or&nbsp;modify&nbsp;these third parties’ Personal Information at any time, as described in <a href="#p8">How to access, modify, or close your account</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="RetentionandStorage"></a>Retention and Storage</strong></p>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in  accordance with our Records Management Policy and applicable laws. This  period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it  will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient  information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example,  we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain  credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to  retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; protect  ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or  limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith  that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations and on  servers controlled by Orbitz, located either at our offices or at the  offices of our service providers as described in <a href="#p7">How we protect Personal Information.</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">return to top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="p7"></a>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we protect Personal Information</span></strong></p>
<p>Orbitz employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to  help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information  and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure  or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is  sent to our service providers, we require in our contracts with them  that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with  the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to contact Orbitz through our Site, you should be aware  that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web  might not be secure. Orbitz assumes no liability for the loss of any  information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, if  you provide your credit card information on our Site’s credit card forms  or if you choose to search for Products and Services, through the  Orbitz mobile applications, that are located near you and we collect  your geo-location, we encrypt the transmission of that information using  secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain  text because we are aware that most Members and Guests cannot readily  process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with  the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read  more easily than encrypted e-mail.</p>
<p><a href="#top">return to top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="p8"></a>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to access, modify or close your Account</span></strong></p>
<p>We endeavor to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. We encourage you to visit your account to review your Personal Information. You can access your Personal Information in My Account and update it or delete inaccuracies, as necessary. For example, you can change at any time your e-mail address, activities and lifestyle preferences, favorite destinations or your preferences for receiving or not receiving commercial communications.</p>
<p>If you wish to close your account, you can do so by contacting us as indicated in <a href="#p13">Contact Information</a>.  We will respond to such requests within 30 days  following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above. If we  receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will  respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days  from the date received. If you request that we close your account,&nbsp;we will promptly do so, to  the extent possible. Once your account is closed, however, you will not  be able to use many of the services available on our Site to Members,  unless you re-register.</p>
<p>Please remember that we may not be able to honor your request if we  are legally obligated to retain information, or for other reasons  described in <a href="#RetentionandStorage">Retention and Storage</a>.</p>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that our computer sends to your computer, and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our Site. A cookie contains a unique identification number that identifies the visitor's browser, but not necessarily the visitor. A pixel tag is a small graphic image similar to a cookie.</p>
<p>When you access our Site, we may place cookies, pixel tags or other code on your computer to collect Session Data. These technologies are used to help us recognize you when you visit our Site again or to help us customize your online experience. Unless you specifically informs us of your identity (e.g., by registering with us), we will not know who you are.</p>
<div>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct  your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or  prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit.

<p><strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong></p>
<p>We work with third parties to serve ads on our Site and to serve ads  on sites owned or operated by other companies.&nbsp;Our ad servers, and those  of our partners, use cookies and pixel tags in order to anonymously  identify your browser. Some ad companies, such as ad  networks, may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with  activity on our Site with information obtained from other sources and/or  sites. We do not use or share your Personal Information with our ad servers, media partners or ad networks without your  authorization.</p>
<p>We use anonymous Session Data, such as the destination of your search, in order to advertise to you on our Site and on other sites. We do not sell your Session Data to any other party in connection with our ad programs but we may use it in order to run ads on behalf of others, such as travel suppliers. For example, we may serve an airline’s ad to you while you are on another site, on behalf of that airline. In such cases, we use third parties to anonymously identify your browser while on another site. You can opt-out of this kind of advertising by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.  By opting out of this kind of advertising you may still receive ads from Orbitz or ads from other parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).</p>
<p><strong>Opting-Out</strong></p>
<p>As part of the registration process we give you the ability to receive commercial communications about Products and Services, updates to our Site and customized advertisements and promotions that are targeted to your specific interests, such as flight specials, promotions, contests, sweepstakes and other travel opportunities available on our Site and/or sponsored by our travel service providers and advertisers. We send these communications directly ourselves or via service providers. If you do not opt-out from receiving these communications, we will send them to you. At any time you may change your selection to receive or not receive these communications by changing your preferences as described in&nbsp;<a href="#p8">How to access, modify or close your account</a>. In addition, these communications will include instructions on how to unsubscribe.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>Orbitz may from time to time monitor and review any information  transmitted or received through our Site, or through telephone or e-mail  communications, for quality assurance and other purposes. We reserve  the right to censor, edit, remove or prohibit the transmission or  receipt of any information that Orbitz deems inappropriate or in  violation of our <a href="http://www.orbitz.com/info/win?id=TermsAndConditions&amp;popupsDisabled=true">Terms and Conditions</a>. During monitoring the information may be examined, recorded or copied.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>When you click on a third party’s link from our Site, or from an ad for a third party served by one of our service providers, you will enter that third party’s site, over which we have no control. We are not responsible for third party sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other sites you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to such other sites and may be very different from this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Social Plug-Ins</strong></p>
