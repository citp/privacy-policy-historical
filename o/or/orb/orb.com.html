<span class="gen4">Privacy Policy</span><br><br>

    <p>Thank you for visiting this Internet Web site located under the universal resource locator at www.orb.com (the "Site").  This privacy
	policy explains the policies implemented throughout Orb Networks  ("Orb") governing Orb's collection, use and disclosure of your personally
	identifiable information provided to Orb via this Site. Our visitors from Europe should note that, as a US company, Orb is certified on the Safe Harbor
        List and abides by the principles set forth in the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

   </p><p><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b><br>

   Orb reserves the right to change this privacy policy from time to time and will post any revisions on the Site located at the URL
   www.Orb.com/index/privacy.  We encourage you to review this Orb privacy policy regularly for any changes.  Your continued use of this
   Site will be subject to the then-current Orb privacy policy.

  </p><p><b>What We Collect and How We Use It</b><br>
  Generally, you may visit this Site without providing Orb with any personally identifiable information. However, in certain sections of
  this Site, we may invite you to submit questions or comments or request information.  Due to the nature of some of these activities, we
  may ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number,
  company name, operating system, mobile devices and email address.  Your personally identifiable information may be used to deliver certain
  services or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter certain password protected areas of the Site, and improve the
  content and general administration of the Site.  If you request that Orb send certain information to a friend, Orb may ask you to submit
  your friend's email address and Orb will only use such email address to send the requested information.  


  </p><p><b>Orb Software</b><br>
The Orb desktop software application resides on your computer. At certain times, such as when you record TV or add new media files, Orb
creates a thumbprint (irreversible signature which contains no media content) that is used to dynamically update your personalized index
of files. Thumbprints do not contain any personally identifiable information such as your name, the subject of the content or the content
file itself.<br>
The Orb software periodically contacts us to check for software updates. No personally identifiable information is sent in this communication.

 </p><p><b>Aggregate Information</b><br>
The Site may track the number of Site visitors, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses, browser type and the domain
names of our users' Internet Service Providers, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information
will be analyzed and retained in aggregate form only and it will not contain information in a manner that is personally identifiable.  We may
use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movements, and gather demographic information for aggregate
use.  We may also disclose certain aggregate information to third parties in connection with our promotion of the Site and the Orb service,
as well as use various portions of the aggregate information in connection with the operation of certain functionality of the Site.

</p><p><b>Cookies</b><br>
To improve your experience and administration of the Site, we may use "cookies" when you are logged into the Site using your e-mail address
and/or password. A cookie is a piece of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be understood by the server
that gave it to you. It functions as your computer's identification token and enables Orb to personalize your experience when you are signed
in to the Site. The cookie also contains your e-mail address so that we can make it easier for you to sign in. If you reject the cookie, you
may not be able to sign up for some of the services or use certain features of the Site.<br>

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance
to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept
cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)<br>
While Orb may use cookies to enable you to use certain services and the Site, Orb does not use this information to identify you personally
except to provide you with the features of the Site.

</p><p><b>Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
We may provide your personally identifiable information that we collect and the data generated by cookies to the vendors and service agencies
that we may engage to assist us.  For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to an organization in order to complete
a service (e.g., process your payment).  Any organization to which we provide such personally identifiable information is also required to
treat your personally identifiable information in accordance with this privacy policy.  We will also disclose your personally identifiable
information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority.  We will not sell your
personally identifiable information to any other company or organization except we may transfer your personally identifiable information
to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Orb participates or to a purchaser of all
or substantially all of Orb's assets. Such successor entity shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.  

</p><p><b>Data Security</b><br>
Orb may employ procedural and technological measures, such as encryption, firewalls, secure socket layer, password protection,
internal restrictions and other security measures, to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access.
Such measures are reasonably designed to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration or destruction.  However, Orb cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat these measures
or use your personally identifiable information for improper purposes.  Therefore, you should consider any communication that you transmit
to Orb (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and you hereby agree that Orb will not be liable
or responsible if personally identifiable information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.  

</p><p><b>Security and Confidentiality</b><br>
</p><li>If you forget your password, you will be asked to go on the Site, answer your security question and create a new password.
No plain text passwords will ever be passed through e-mail.</li>
<li>Your Web-based access to your personally identifiable information is protected by an encrypted password. We recommend that you do not
disclose your password to anyone. The security of your personally identifiable information also relies on customers protecting their Orb
password. If you suspect that someone may have obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by signing in to your
account at <a href="http://www.orb.com/" target="_blank">http://www.orb.com/</a> to manage your "myOrb Account Settings."</li>

<li>Additionally, your personally identifiable information resides on a firewall-protected server that only selected Orb personnel have
access to via password.</li>

<p><b>Communications</b><br>
We strive to communicate with our customers in a timely, respectful, and honest manner. If you are receiving emails from Orb, and at any
time no longer wish to receive these communications, you may unsubscribe from a mailing list by following the instructions contained at the
bottom of the email.<br>
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement that is not promotional in nature. These announcements
may notify you of planned service suspensions and outages, as well as other administrative matters. Generally, you may not opt-out of these
communications, though you can deactivate your account. These notifications will generally be sent to a validated e-mail address for your
account.

</p><p><b>Children's Privacy</b><br>
Orb is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's
online activities and interests. Orb's services, software and Site are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13.
Orb does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 and Orb does not target its services,
software or this Site to children under 13.

</p><p><b>Contact Information</b><br>
If you have any questions about anything in this privacy policy, or about collection of personally identifiable information via this Site,
please direct any questions regarding the above statement to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@orb.com">privacy@orb.com</a>.
