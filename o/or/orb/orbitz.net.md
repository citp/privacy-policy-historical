**Session Data**

We use Session Data to better understand how our Site is navigated to and used, so we can improve our Site’s content and ease of use, personalize and improve your individual viewing experiences on our Site and provide information that may be of interest to you.

We may use aggregated information to describe our user base to current or potential partners, investors and advertisers; after a survey, to understand and respond to market needs and preferences; or to make recommendations to other users of our Site. For example, if users of our Site who have traveled to a particular destination told us that they had positive experiences at a hotel in that destination, we might recommend that hotel.

**What we do NOT do**

We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, Member ID, password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our priority. For more information about phishing, you may want to visit the [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt127.shtm).

We will share with these companies only that Personal Information which they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in countries outside the US and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).Your Personal Information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to Orbitz, and under the instructions of Orbitz, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy Policy. By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of your data outside the US and outside the EEA;

We encourage you to read a company's privacy policy before requesting any of its products or services;
  * To protect our Site and our rights under our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.orbitz.com/info/win?id=TermsAndConditions&popupsDisabled=true); to protect ourselves against liability or prevent fraudulent activity; or where it is necessary to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain;

**Disclosure without Consent**

**Please note that there are circumstances where the use or disclosure of Personal Information may be justified or permitted, or where Orbitz may be obligated to disclose information without consent.** Such circumstances may include:

  * If required to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information or to comply with the rules of a court relating to the production of records. If we receive a formal request to disclose your Personal Information in connection with a legal action, we will attempt to contact you about it, if permitted by law, via the e-mail address you provided during registration, before we respond to that request;

**6. How we retain and store Personal information**

**My Trips and My Account**

If you are a Member, we store your Personal Information in My Trips and My Account. You can access My Trips and My Account from the [home page](http://www.orbitz.com/) of our Site, after logging onto our Site. My Trips contains information about your current, canceled or past trips. My Account contains your name, e-mail address, e-mail and password settings, and departure city from which you usually travel. It may also contain other information so that you do not need to re-enter it each time you Book a Product or Service. For example, My Account may contain your billing information unless you tell us not to store it. It may also contain your preferences for seat selection or special meals, details about your participation in loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers and other travel preferences. We also keep in My Account all other information that you have elected to provide us, such as gender, activities and lifestyle preferences and favorite destinations.

You can access, modify or close your account as described in How to access, modify, or close your account.

**Third Parties’ Personal Information**

We will retain in your My Account, the Personal Information of individuals for whom you have made reservations or to whom we have sent Orbitz Care Alerts on your behalf.

You can access or modify these third parties’ Personal Information at any time, as described in How to access, modify, or close your account.

**Retention and Storage**

We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our Records Management Policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.

Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by Orbitz, located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers as described in How we protect Personal Information.

return to top

**7. How we protect Personal Information**

Orbitz employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require in our contracts with them that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.

If you choose to contact Orbitz through our Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Orbitz assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, if you provide your credit card information on our Site’s credit card forms or if you choose to search for Products and Services, through the Orbitz mobile applications, that are located near you and we collect your geo-location, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members and Guests cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.

return to top

**8. How to access, modify or close your Account**

We endeavor to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. We encourage you to visit your account to review your Personal Information. You can access your Personal Information in My Account and update it or delete inaccuracies, as necessary. For example, you can change at any time your e-mail address, activities and lifestyle preferences, favorite destinations or your preferences for receiving or not receiving commercial communications.

If you wish to close your account, you can do so by contacting us as indicated in Contact Information. We will respond to such requests within 30 days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above. If we receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days from the date received. If you request that we close your account, we will promptly do so, to the extent possible. Once your account is closed, however, you will not be able to use many of the services available on our Site to Members, unless you re-register.

Please remember that we may not be able to honor your request if we are legally obligated to retain information, or for other reasons described in Retention and Storage.

**9. Privacy**

**Cookies and pixel tags**

A cookie is a small text file that our computer sends to your computer, and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our Site. A cookie contains a unique identification number that identifies the visitor's browser, but not necessarily the visitor. A pixel tag is a small graphic image similar to a cookie.

When you access our Site, we may place cookies, pixel tags or other code on your computer to collect Session Data. These technologies are used to help us recognize you when you visit our Site again or to help us customize your online experience. Unless you specifically informs us of your identity (e.g., by registering with us), we will not know who you are.

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. You can learn more about the use of cookies by clicking [here](http://networkadvertising.org/) or [here](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will be able to access those parts of our Site that are available to the general public, but you will not be able to access many of Products and Services.

**Third Party Advertisers**

We work with third parties to serve ads on our Site and to serve ads on sites owned or operated by other companies. Our ad servers, and those of our partners, use cookies and pixel tags in order to anonymously identify your browser. Some ad companies, such as ad networks, may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with activity on our Site with information obtained from other sources and/or sites. We do not use or share your Personal Information with our ad servers, media partners or ad networks without your authorization.

We use anonymous Session Data, such as the destination of your search, in order to advertise to you on our Site and on other sites. We do not sell your Session Data to any other party in connection with our ad programs but we may use it in order to run ads on behalf of others, such as travel suppliers. For example, we may serve an airline’s ad to you while you are on another site, on behalf of that airline. In such cases, we use third parties to anonymously identify your browser while on another site. You can opt-out of this kind of advertising by clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). By opting out of this kind of advertising you may still receive ads from Orbitz or ads from other parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).

**Opting-Out**

As part of the registration process we give you the ability to receive commercial communications about Products and Services, updates to our Site and customized advertisements and promotions that are targeted to your specific interests, such as flight specials, promotions, contests, sweepstakes and other travel opportunities available on our Site and/or sponsored by our travel service providers and advertisers. We send these communications directly ourselves or via service providers. If you do not opt-out from receiving these communications, we will send them to you. At any time you may change your selection to receive or not receive these communications by changing your preferences as described in How to access, modify or close your account. In addition, these communications will include instructions on how to unsubscribe.

**Monitoring**

Orbitz may from time to time monitor and review any information transmitted or received through our Site, or through telephone or e-mail communications, for quality assurance and other purposes. We reserve the right to censor, edit, remove or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any information that Orbitz deems inappropriate or in violation of our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.orbitz.com/info/win?id=TermsAndConditions&popupsDisabled=true). During monitoring the information may be examined, recorded or copied.

**Links**

When you click on a third party’s link from our Site, or from an ad for a third party served by one of our service providers, you will enter that third party’s site, over which we have no control. We are not responsible for third party sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other sites you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to such other sites and may be very different from this Privacy Policy.

**Social Plug-Ins**

Our Site includes social plug-ins, such as the Facebook or Twitter button, and gives you the option to post information about your activities on our Site to your social media accounts. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social plug-ins are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. We may also undergo a change of ownership. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy to our Site, as well as to existing information held by us.

If we decide to change this policy in a material way, we will obtain the necessary consents required under applicable privacy laws if we seek to collect, use or disclose Personal Information for purposes other than those to which consent has been obtained, unless otherwise required or permitted by law. If we make any material changes we will notify you by e-mail (at the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on our Site prior to the change becoming effective.
