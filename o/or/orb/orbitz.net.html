<blockquote>

<p>Orbitz employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of Personal Information.
When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require, in our contracts with them, that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you choose to contact Orbitz through the Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Orbitz assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, should you choose to pay by credit card when making a booking or reservation on the Site, your card details are encrypted for the transaction.</p>

<p>In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members, Guests or Subscribers cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We endeavor to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. We encourage you to visit your <a href="http://www.orbitz.com" target="_new">My Stuff</a> tab to review your Personal Information.  </p>

<p>You can access your Personal Information in My Stuff and update it, correct it or modify it as necessary.  For example, you can change at any time your e-mail address, preferred activities, preferred destinations or your preferences for receiving or not receiving our e-mails, e-newsletters or instant messaging customized advertisements. </p>

<p>If you wish to modify or delete other Personal Information, you can do so by contacting us as indicated in <a href="#p12">Contact Information</a>. </p>

<p>If you request that we remove all of the Personal Information or travel records stored in My Stuff, we will promptly do so, to the extent possible.  Once required Personal Information is removed, however, you will not be able to use many of the services available on our Site to Members, unless you re-register. </p>

<p>Please remember that we may not be able to honor your request if we are legally obligated to retain that information, or for other reasons as described in our <a href="#p6">Retention and Storage</a> policy.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and pixel tags</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A Cookie is a small text file that our computer sends to your computer, and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our Site. A cookie contains a unique identification number that identifies the visitor's browser, but not necessarily the visitor. A pixel tag is a small graphic image similar to a cookie.</p>

<p>When you access our Site, our computer may seek to place "cookies" or "pixel tags" on your personal computer to collect Session Data. Cookies and pixel tags are used to help us recognize you when you visit our Site again, or to help us customize your online experience. Unless a visitor specifically informs us of his/her identity (e.g. by registering with us), we will not know who the individual visitor is.</p>

<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. You can learn more about the use of cookies by visiting <a href="http://networkadvertising.org" target="_new">http://networkadvertising.org</a> or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="#">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will be able to access those parts of our Site that are available to the general public, but you will not be able to access many of the Products and Services offered at our Site.</p>

<p><strong>Third Parties and Advertising</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Third parties advertise on our Site, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet.  These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners believe you may be interested.  While we may share Session Data with third parties to help facilitate the serving of these ads, we do not share any Personal Information about you unless you give us permission to do so, separate from any permission you provide during the Member registration process. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>When you click on a third party's link from our Site, you will leave our Site and will enter that third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.</p>

<p><strong> Opting-Out</strong></p>

<p>As part of the registration process we give you the ability to receive via e-mail or direct messaging information about our Products and Services, updates to our Site and customized advertisements and promotions that are targeted to your specific interest, such as flight specials, promotions, contests, sweepstakes and other travel opportunities available on our Site and/or sponsored by our travel service providers and advertisers.  We send this information directly ourselves or via third party service providers.</p>

<p>If you do not opt-out from receiving these communications about our Site, we will send them to you. </p>

<p>At any time you may change which of the communications you wish to receive or not, by changing your preferences as described in <a href="#p8">How to access, modify or delete Personal Information</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, in our e-mails and other communications we will include instructions on how to unsubscribe and inform us of preferences if you decide you do not want to receive any future marketing or promotional e-mails from us.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Orbitz may from time to time monitor and review any information transmitted or received through the Site, or through telephone  or email communications, for quality assurance and other purposes. We  reserve the right to censor, edit, remove or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any information that Orbitz deems inappropriate or in violation of these Terms and Conditions. During monitoring the information may be examined, recorded or copied.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For your convenience, our Site provides links to other sites.  When you click on one of these links, you are leaving our Site and entering another site.  We are not responsible for such third party sites.

<p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy and Changes in Ownership</strong></p>

<p>We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time.  We may also undergo a change of ownership. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy to the Site, as well as to existing information held by us. </p>

<p>If we decide to change this policy in a material way, we will obtain the necessary consents required under applicable privacy laws if we seek to collect, use or disclose Personal Information for purposes other than those to which consent has been obtained, unless otherwise required or permitted by law. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that we remove your Personal Information (and/or that of other individuals for whom you made travel reservations or who have received your Orbitz Care Alerts) from our records, as described in <a href="#p8">How to access, modify or delete your Personal Information</a>.</p>
