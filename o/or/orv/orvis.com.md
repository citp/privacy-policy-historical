# ORVIS PRIVACY POLICY

Welcome to the Orvis website. Because your privacy is very important to us, we want you to understand our practices with regard to collecting and using your information both online and offline and the steps we take to safeguard it. This statement applies to personally identifiable information collected from our customers. When this PRIVACY POLICY uses the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, EMail address, credit card number, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product preferences, or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this PRIVACY POLICY. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this PRIVACY POLICY as "personal information" or "personal data."

We welcome any and all questions and feedback. For privacy-related issues, please contact us at:
