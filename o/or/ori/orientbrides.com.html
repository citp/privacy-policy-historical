<p>
	Depending on what you do when you visit any Web site, you are providing information about your visit to the site's
	owners. This includes AsianDate.com. We value privacy and think you do too, so we want you to have the
	information you need to make your own decisions about your personal privacy. When you visit or supply information
	to any Web site, we think it's a good idea for you to first understand what that site's privacy policies are.
	If the site doesn't tell you, don't hesitate to ask.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line at www.AsianDate.com is that we only use the information that we get from your visit for
	internal tracking purposes, to make AsianDate.com as useful and interesting to you as we can, and to respond
	to your requests for information or other services. Except for as specifically noted, we do not use your personal
	information for any other purpose; we never sell it to any third party; and we never share it with any third party.

<h3>What personal information we collect:</h3>
<p>
	When you visit the AsianDate.com Web site, we capture the Internet provider's domain name and country that you
	came from (e.g., 'aol.com') and the paths taken as you move from page to page (i.e., your "click stream"
	activity).
</p>

<h3>Visitor Registration or Requests for Information:</h3>
<p>
	AsianDate.com only collects personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using or
	registering with the AsianDate.com site. "Personal information" includes information that can identify

	Web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the internet provider's domain name
	and country that our visitors come from (e.g. 'aol.com,' or 'umich.edu') and the addresses of sites visited
	immediately before, and after, coming to AsianDate.com. However, none of this is associated with you as an
	individual. It is measured only in aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your "click
	stream" activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page. Cookies do not
	capture your individual email address or any private information about you.
