# OriginLab web site - Privacy Policy

|   |   | 

#### **OriginLab Online Privacy Policy:**

OriginLab is committed to protecting your privacy. You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains data collection and use in those situations. This privacy statement only applies to OriginLab.com; it does not apply to other online or offline OriginLab sites, products or services. Please read the complete OriginLab.com privacy statement. 

**Collection of personal information**

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are downloading a demo of our products, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering OriginLab products. Personal information collected by OriginLab.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

For example: If you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase in the Store area of the Web site, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number. 

When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. We keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site. 

OriginLab also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of OriginLab.com. 

**Use of your Personal Information**

We use your personal information for the following purposes:  


  * To ensure our site is relevant to your needs. 
  * To deliver services, such as newsletters, events, training or software, that you request or purchase. 
  * To help us create and publish content most relevant to you. 
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from OriginLab, if you so request. 
  * To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate. 



We will merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of OriginLab.com, with your approval, we will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and won’t merge your personal information with site-visitation data.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, mailing and sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

OriginLab may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on OriginLab or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of OriginLab and its family of Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of OriginLab employees, users of OriginLab products or services, or members of the public.

Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which OriginLab or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. OriginLab abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

**Control of your Personal Information**

When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, OriginLab.com will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. 

Registering also allows you to tell us how or whether you want OriginLab.com to communicate with you. After registering, go to the Profile Center and establish your preferences in the Contact Options sections. There, you can decide what information you want to receive and how you want to receive it.

If you buy software through OriginLab.com, and do not want to receive such information, do not check the box on the Checkout page (or on other pages where personal information is collected) which says: Yes, I would like to receive other offers through shop.OriginLab.com.

OriginLab.com may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service or security issues related to a product or service you requested, or confirming you requested a product or service. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen.

We may share aggregated site statistics with partner companies but do not allow other companies to place clear gifs on our sites.
