### **Does Perry Ellis use cookies or other tracking technologies?**

We use cookies, web beacons (also known as pixel tags) and other technologies to speed your navigation of the Site, recognize your computer and your access privileges, understand your Site usage, and help make the Site more user-friendly, efficient, and secure.  Cookies are small data files or small bits of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive when you visit our Site so that we can recognize you. Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the Site has been viewed and, if so, how many times.     
The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how you may prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. However, Perry Ellis is not responsible for and does not guarantee the effectiveness of browser tools. 

We also use these technologies to control the number of times you see a given ad, to deliver ads and other product offers and suggestions to you that relate to your interests, product selections or purchases, and measure the effectiveness of various offers and ad campaigns. In all cases, this information helps us serve you better by improving our Site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions. If you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of these services.

**_Do Not Track_**

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, Perry Ellis and the Site do not recognize DNT.
