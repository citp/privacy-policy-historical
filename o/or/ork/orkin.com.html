        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Orkin, Inc. understands you may have concerns about privacy while shopping 
           on the Internet. Orkin, Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. That 
           is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Policy is intended to 
           describe how your personal information is processed and used, and we will 
           make every effort to ensure that our activities keep with the spirit of 
           this Policy. Please note that by visiting and using Orkin.com, you are 
           accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>What Information is Orkin, Inc. gathering about its visitors?</h3>
        <p>Every computer connected to the Internet is provided with a domain name 
           (e.g. earthlink.net) and an IP Address (e.g. 192.164.13.145). When a 
           visitor requests a page from within the Orkin.com Web site, our Web 
           Servers automatically identify and log the HTTP request that is made to 
           our Web Server. This information reveals nothing personal about you.</p>
        <p>When you schedule an appointment on myorkin.com, we ask for your name, 
           address, phone number, email address and other personal information 
           necessary to fulfill your request.</p>
        <p>Occasionally we conduct surveys and contests on myorkin.com. If you choose 
           to participate in an online contest, we may request information from you 
           that will permit us to administer the contest and notify the winner(s). In 
           addition, we may ask for other personally identifiable information 
           including but not limited to name, address, email, and phone number.</p>
        <h3>How is it being used?</h3>
        <p>Information collected on orkin.com may be used in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Schedule appointments</li>
            <li>Respond to your customer service inquiries </li>
            <li>Provide promotional communication and other information to you, if you choose to receive them </li>
            <li>Offer the products you want </li>
            <li>Customize your Orkin.com experience </li>
            <li>Improve our website design </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What about Cookies?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are transferred to your computer's 
           hard drive through your Web browser from our Web Server. A cookie cannot 
           read data from your hard disk or read cookie files that may have been 
           created from other sites. The Orkin.com Web site utilizes cookies as a 
           means of providing personalization features to our visitors. For example, 
           we utilize cookies to remember settings (zipcodes, accessibility settings, 
           etc.) that you may have made at our Web site.</p>
        <p>The information stored in a cookie cannot be used to identify you 
           personally unless combined with information that you have provided in 
           connection with scheduling an appointment or registering for promotional 
           emails, contests, or surveys. </p>
        <p>You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your 
           browser. Typically, by accessing the browser's help feature you can obtain 
           information on how to prevent your browser from accepting all cookies or 
           to notify you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept 
           these cookies, your experience at our Web site and other web sites may be 
           diminished, and some features may not work as intended.</p>
        <p>Orkin, Inc. has carefully selected Coremetrics, Inc. to further assist us 
           in better understanding your use of our website. Coremetrics will place 
           unique cookies on your computer to collect information such as IP address, 
           site navigation information within our web properties, and email address 
           (if you have provided it). Coremetrics does not collect your name and 
           address, username, password, or credit card information. Coremetrics 
           analyzes the information it collects and returns it to us so that we may 
           determine whether site improvements are needed. Coremetrics is required to 
           keep all information that it collects confidential and is prohibited from 
           using data collected from our site for any other purposes.</p>
        <h3>How does Orkin.com protect my personal data?</h3>
        <p>Orkin, Inc. uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed 
           to us secure. We have implemented security policies, rules and technical 
           measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, improper 
           use or disclosure or unauthorized modification. We also advise all Orkin 
           employees about their responsibility to protect customer data and we 
           provide them with appropriate guidelines for adhering to our company's 
           business ethics standards and confidentiality policies.</p>
        <h3>What other information does Orkin.com request?</h3>
        <p>We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the 
           purposes of conducting a survey, adding you to our mailing list or to have 
           someone contact you for additional information by your request. Whenever 
           we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose 
           of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict 
           "No Spam" policy that means we do not intend to sell, rent or otherwise 
           give your e-mail address to a third- party, without your consent.</p>
        <p>In addition, Orkin, Inc. will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed 
           to receive. If you are a member of our Mailing List, you will be contacted 
           with announcements, news and new products or services. You have the option 
           of "Unsubscribing" from our Mailing List at any time, thereby disabling 
           any further such e-mail communication from being sent to you. If you wish 
           to have specific communications with a member of the Orkin, Inc. staff, 
           you will be required to provide specific information that will be routed 
           to the appropriate contact within Orkin, Inc.</p>
        <h3>How does Orkin.com support the Childrens’ Online Privacy Protection Rule?</h3>
        <p>We observe appropriate national laws and regulations on children's 
           privacy, including in the United States the Children's Online Privacy 
           Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998. Orkin does not actively market to 
           children, and we never knowingly ask a child under 13 to divulge personal 
           information. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal information 
           without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian may e-mail 
           us, and we will remove the information and unsubscribe the child from any 
           promotional contact opportunities.</p>
        <h3>Will Orkin, Inc. disclose the information collected to Third Parties?</h3>
        <p>Orkin, Inc. will disclose your personal information or any of its log file 
           information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such 
           actions are necessary to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on Orkin, Inc. </li>
            <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of Orkin, Inc., or visitors of Orkin, Inc. </li>
            <li>Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice or the rights of third parties.</li>
            <li>Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Orkin, Inc. uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed 
           to us secure. Orkin, Inc. reserves the right to transfer information in 
           connection with the sale of all or part of Orkin, Inc. capital stock or 
           assets to any third party. Furthermore, we are not responsible for any 
           breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive 
           the information. Orkin, Inc. also provides "links" to a wide variety of 
           other Web sites on the Internet. We are not responsible for their Privacy 
           Policies or how those web sites manage information about their users. We 
           strongly urge you to check with those web sites to determine their privacy 
           policy.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this policy at any time.  
           Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this page so that you 
           are always aware of the information that we collect, how we use it and 
           under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
