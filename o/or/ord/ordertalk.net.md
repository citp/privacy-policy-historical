#### Introduction

orderTalk, Inc. (“orderTalk”) provides online ordering as a service to subscribed food chains. In running this service, orderTalk receives personally identifiable information (“personal information”) from its food chain clients about a variety of online consumer transactions (“transaction data”).

This policy sets forth orderTalk's general privacy and security practices with respect to this personal information. While this policy sets forth orderTalk's general privacy and security practices, specific requirements are governed by its contractual arrangements with client food chains. With the exception of personal data covered under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, in the event of a conflict between this policy and a food chain contract, the food chain contract prevails.

This policy does not describe how personal information may be used by food chain clients who collect such information directly from consumers. Consumers should review the privacy policies of the business entities with which they directly share their data to learn about such entities’ privacy practices.

#### Nature of the data received

orderTalk receives transaction data from its food chain clients, which generally are fast-food chains selling goods or services on the Internet and in other card-not-present scenarios. Transaction data may relate to the purchase and sale of goods or services. This transaction data may include personal information, including but not limited to, a consumer’s name, title, delivery address, telephone number(s), email address, and credit card number or other payment information.

#### Use of the data received

orderTalk processes personal information on behalf of the food chain client to process payment and relay consumer food orders to the required restaurant for timely delivery or collection. At the consumer's choice, payment information is retained for expedition of future transactions, at which point information is retained in the consumer's demographics. Additional data elements may be added to the transaction record, through the use of third-party data services if those data services are elected by food chain clients.

The period for which personal information is retained is determined by the contract between orderTalk and each individual food chain client. Consumers should contact the business entities with which they directly share their data to learn how long their transaction data may be retained. orderTalk has put in place mechanisms to protect the accuracy and integrity of personal information.

#### Consumer Data Management

Consumers register for online ordering to the particular chain they’re attempting to place an online order from. Each consumer registered account is uniquely accessibly by them only, and includes the ability to update/change their data or delete the account if required. We acknowledge the specific right of EU consumers to access their personal data under the Privacy Shield.

Each consumer also has the right to opt in or out from receiving promotions as part of their account management, and can also remove saved delivery addresses or credit cards if so desired.

#### Disclosures to third parties

orderTalk shares transaction data only with the following types of third parties:

  1. Credit Card Payment Processors for processing online consumer payments
  2. The particular Food Chain and its related POS system from which the consumer is placing their food order – so they may identify and deliver the food to the consumer.



orderTalk shares transaction data with third parties only in the following limited circumstances:

  1. Personal information may be accessible to third-party service providers processing data on behalf of orderTalk; however, any such service providers are required by contract to implement privacy and security safeguards consistent with this policy;
  2. Personal information may be disclosed to third parties as directed by the food chain client, including to third-party services used to validate data elements;
  3. orderTalk, Inc may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
