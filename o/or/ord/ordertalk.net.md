Our Privacy Policy

All subscribers to the orderTalk Newsletter and visitors to the orderTalk Web site are covered by our Privacy Policy: 

  1. We will never sell, rent, or give away your address to any outside party.
  2. We will never send you any unrequested e-mail, besides newsletter updates.
  3. All unsubscribe requests are honored within 48 hours.

**_What this Means_**   
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect for the orderTalk Newsletter (the "Newsletter") and through the orderTalk Web Site (the "Web Site"). For information on how we handle information collected by any other means (e.g., via customer information forms, etc.), please contact us. 

  1. **_We will never sell, rent, or give away your address to any outside party._**   
If you are a subscriber to the Newsletter, we collect your e-mail address. We then send each issue of the Newsletter to your e-mail address, or we send a notification to your e-mail address that the Newsletter is available at the Web Site. 

Visitors to the Web Site who send us an e-mail or who use the form on the contact us page may provide additional information, some of which may be personal information. For each visitor to the Web Site, we may collect the Internet Protocol address from which you accessed the Web Site, the contents of forms and queries, what items you clicked on each applicable Web page, information about the browser you are using, and other usage information. Some of this information is personal, and some of it is not. 

Your personal information will never be used except to make the Newsletter available to you if you are a subscriber, or to contact you if there is a question about your Newsletter subscription or to respond to a query about the Newsletter or the Web Site. We will never sell, rent, or give away your personal information to any outside party, ever. We may disclose your personal information to a person or company that subsequently owns or maintains the Newsletter or the Web Site, but only if that person or company agrees to comply with the provisions of this Privacy Policy with respect to the use of your information. 

  2. **_We will never send you any unrequested e-mail, besides newsletter updates._**   
In addition to the other e-mails discussed above in this Privacy Policy, we may send you e-mail updates about your subscription to the Newsletter or your use of the Web Site. We will never send you any other unrequested or unrelated e-mail. 
  3. **_All unsubscribe requests are honored within 48 hours._**   
If you choose to unsubscribe, we will honor your request. Our computer systems usually process unsubscribe requests within a few moments of receiving the request. If our computer systems are temporarily offline, we will take all reasonable steps to get them working again. Note that we can only honor unsubscribe requests that provide all of the information we need to unsubscribe you, such as the specific e-mail address that you use for your subscription. For example, if you provide us with a name, but not a complete e-mail address, then we cannot unsubscribe you from the Newsletter or the Site as there may be many different subscribers with similar-sounding names.
