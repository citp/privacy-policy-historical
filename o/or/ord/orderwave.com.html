1. Information Collection and Use<br>
DRG Intelligent Computer Concepts, Inc. is the sole owner of the information 
collected on orderwave.com. DRG Intelligent Computer Concepts, Inc. collects 
information from our users at several different points on our Web site.<br>
<br>
We store information that we collect through cookies and log files. A profile is 
stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing 
preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users 
personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of 
the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a users visit to our Web 
site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your 
profile with other third parties. <br>
<br>
Cookies<br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the users computer tied to information 
about the user. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent 
cookie is a small text file stored on the users hard drive for an extended 
period of time. If users reject the cookie, they may not enjoy full 
functionality of the site. <br>
<br>
Log Files<br>
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet 
protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), 
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to 
analyze trends, administer the site, track users movement in the aggregate, and 
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to 
personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. Communications from the Site<br>
Newsletter<br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information 
such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide 
a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out 
sections.<br>
<br>
Service Announcements<br>
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related 
announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for 
maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of 
these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these 
communications are not promotional in nature. <br>
<br>
Customer Service<br>
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and 
in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in 
accordance with the users wishes.<br>
<br>
Sharing<br>
Legal Disclaimer<br>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose 
personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief 
that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a 
court order or legal process served on our Web site.<br>
<br>
Choice/Opt-out<br>
Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information 
used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for 
information<br>
<br>
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional 
communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the 
Opt Out link in the email.<br>
<br>
3. Security<br>
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users information. When 
users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is 
protected both online and off-line.<br>
<br>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information such 
as credit card number and/or social security number, that information is 
encrypted and is protected with SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order 
form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and 
Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, 
when users are just surfing.<br>
<br>
If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send 
an email to support@4icc.com. <br>
<br>
4. Supplementation of Information <br>
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is 
necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 
3rd party sources.<br>
<br>
Enhancement of Marketing Profile<br>
We purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database 
to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users 
would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay the 
profile of individual users. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied 
to the users personally identifiable information. See also the Profile.<br>
<br>
4. Notification of Changes<br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 
privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our 
users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in 
accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
<br>
<br>
If, however, we are going to use users personally identifiable information in a 
manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users 
via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all 
communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they 
will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new 
manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices 
that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post 
a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases 
where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive 
communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
<br>
