Once we have received your information, we will take appropriate measures to try to prevent unauthorised access.

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.

You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at Customer Services, Ordnance Survey, Explorer House, Adanac Drive, Southampton SO16 0AS or [customerservices@os.uk](mailto:customerservices@os.uk).

If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or use these services.
