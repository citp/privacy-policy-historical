  Because OrderUp is committed to protecting your privacy, OrderUp will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose this information to any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy. OrderUp maintains all personal information as private to the best of the  company’s ability. However, personal information may be disclosed under the limited circumstances described below, and by submitting your personal information, you agree that OrderUp may do so.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all OrderUp websites and domains, except that a Privacy Policy or statement posted on a specific website operated by OrderUp, if any, will apply instead of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>To participate in certain activities and to obtain certain services offered on our web site, you will be asked to provide varying amounts of personal information.</p>
<p>In addition to the information you provide, OrderUp may also collect information during your visit to an OrderUp website through our automatic data collection tools, which may include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an OrderUp website. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with OrderUp websites) and product information. OrderUp may also use some of these automatic data collection tools in connection with certain emails sent from OrderUp and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email.</p>
<p><strong>HOW ORDERUP USES PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>OrderUp uses your personal information to better meet individual needs, to respond to specific requests for information, to send promotional materials, and to make you aware of new or similar products or offerings in which you might be interested. </p>
<p>OrderUp reserves the right to call or send registrants email communications from time to time regarding product and company updates, technical or administrative issues, legal notices, promotional offers or other important information about the website and products and service considered valuable or essential to your continued ability to use them properly. OrderUp does not intentionally send unsolicited emails to anyone who has requested that OrderUp not contact them. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>

OrderUp will not disclose personal information to any third parties without your consent except in the following very limited circumstances. </p>

<p>OrderUp shares information with trusted agents who provide specific services you have requested and/or administer information offered at the OrderUp website, for example, service providers who help manage, track and respond to customer orders, inquiries, information requests, etc. OrderUp may also share information with authorized advertisers of certain products and services.

Any company that OrderUp shares personally identifiable information with will have executed a confidentiality agreement, requiring that they keep all data received confidential.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTY VENDORS</strong></p>
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p>
<p>OrderUp will disclose your personal information to a third party if required to do so by law or if, in good faith, OrderUp believes that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend the company’s rights and property or prevent fraud; (3) protect the company against abuse, misuse or unauthorized use of OrderUp's products or services; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of personnel, users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false or deceptive registration information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you including your computer's IP address - may be disclosed to a third party (including the recipient of an email) as part of any type of investigation into your actions.</p>
<p><strong>IP ADDRESSES</strong></p>
<p>An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. The servers that serve the OrderUp website automatically identify a computer by its IP address. If OrderUp, in good faith, determines that you have used the service to menace, threaten, harass, intimidate or otherwise deceptively pose as another person, your actions will be investigated and your IP address may be disclosed to the recipient of any email, their legal counsel or representatives, and law enforcement officials as part of such an investigation.</p>
<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
<p>A "cookie" is a small piece of data stored on a user's browser, and contains non-personally identifiable information about the user. When you visit the website, OrderUp may place a "cookie" in order to improve your experience by recognizing you when you visit the website and in order to allow the company to optimize the information presented based on your demonstrated areas of interest. Cookies may also be used to compile information about website usage. This information can be used to enhance the content of the website and make your experience more informative. If you subsequently provide us with personal information such as your email address, we will associate any cookies on your browser with that information such that you will no longer be an anonymous visitor to the site.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that OrderUp is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. OrderUp encourages users to be aware when they leave this website and to read the privacy statements of each website they visit that collects personal information.

<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>OrderUp employs industry-standard security procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality of users' personal information. OrderUp, or agents and partners on behalf of OrderUp, do everything in reasonable control to protect your information. Where one of OrderUp’s partners or agents has access to or maintains sensitive personal information, the company enters into confidentiality agreements in order to ensure the privacy of such user information. Internally, access to all users' and registrants' personally identifiable information is restricted to those employees who need access in order to fulfill their job responsibilities. Furthermore, OrderUp employees who deal with user information are kept up to date on various security and privacy practice issues as they arise.</p>
<p>Finally, the servers for the website are stored in a physically secured, offsite facility. Beyond the physical security of your information, OrderUp also backs up servers regularly to prevent loss of data.
