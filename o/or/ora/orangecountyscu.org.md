                         Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
   Why?                  consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also re uires us to tell you
                         how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice
                         carefully to understand what we do.
  What?                  The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you
