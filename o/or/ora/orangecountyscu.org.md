**WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY**

It is the policy of Orange County's Credit Union to respect our member's right to privacy in your dealings with us. We strive to keep the information you share with us secure and confidential. 

**Security and Confidentiality**

Keeping your financial information secure is a top priority. Our associates only access your information when necessary to complete a transaction you request, respond to an inquiry, maintain your account, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your non-public personal information. Our staff is trained to comply with our established security procedures. 

**Information Collection**

When you inquire about one of our products or services, complete any of our forms or applications, or engage in a transaction with us, we collect information about you that is necessary to provide the information, product or service. In order to analyze and meet your financial needs, we may also use other information about you that is publicly available, such as information from credit reports, public records or market research. 

**Affiliated Companies**

We limit our information sharing practices to those companies with whom we have agreements to provide you a wide variety of financial products and services such as insurance and securities firms, or those that assist the credit union in providing these services - for example, our ATM Network, Mortgage Company and Shared Service Centers. Those companies agree not to redisclose the information received by the credit union. We may also share information with our affiliated Credit Union Service Organization in order to make other services available to you. In certain instances, you have the right to tell us not to share information with these entities. 

**Account Aggregators**

Many companies are offering account aggregation services that collect information from all of your accounts at financial institutions, brokerages, etc. and consolidate the information into one site for your convenience. In order for this to happen, you will have to provide a company with sensitive account information, personal identifiers and an access code or Personal Identification Number. By giving up your access code or PIN, you are authorizing that company to access your account. All transactions conducted by the account aggregator using an access code you provide to them are considered authorized by you. 

**Accuracy of Information**

We endeavor to keep our information about your accounts accurate and current. If you find any problems with any of your statements or other credit union information, please contact us in writing at Orange County's Credit Union, PO Box 11777, Santa Ana, CA 92711-1777 or by phone at 714-755-5900, option 2, during regular business hours. We will research your request and correct any inaccuracies. 

**Online Privacy Policy**

We do not use Cookies on our website. Our internet banking product does use temporary Cookies, called Session Cookies which are only valid for that log-on session. If you send us an email, you should know that email is not necessarily secure against interception. If your communication includes sensitive information like your account, charge card, or social security number, please contact us by postal mail or telephone rather than email. 

We do not collect information about you from our website unless you complete an application or other form available on the website; or communicate with us through our website. The Credit Union does not collect information through our website on children under the age of 13. 

Our privacy policy does not extend to other entities you link to through our site. You should review the privacy policy for each site you visit, and if communicating sensitive personal information through that site, you should also review the security features for that site.
