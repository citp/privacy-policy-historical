## WordPress

From version 4.9.6 onward WordPress includes GDPR compliance tools. You can read about these [here](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/).

The site does not allow WordPress members, so there is no user information stored or tracked beyond that mentioned in the Cookie Policy.

WordPress writes to a comments cookie to simplify future comments by the user. This functionality is optional as of WordPress version 4.9.6.

WordPress normally tracks the IP address of comments. The IP addresses of existing comments have been removed and the "Remove IP" plugin has been installed and enabled to prevent future comments from recording the poster's IP address.

## Contact Form

The [contact form](https://web.archive.org/misc/site-info#contactus) on this website doesn't store the messages that were sent. Any emails that are sent come directly to me, are read and deleted once they've been dealt with.

## Website Comments

The comments on the main website a stored and displayed indefinitely. They act as a history of corrections suggested by readers. Comments can be left anonymously, so there is no need to leave personal information unless you want to. The IP address of the sender is not tracked or stored.

## WordPress Comments

The main blog allows comments, which are locked after 30 days. Other WordPress sites served from this server do not allow comments. See the WordPress section for further clarification about WordPress security.

## Server Logs

Web server access and error logs may contain information that can be used to identify a user. These are compressed once a week and logs older than 6 months removed.

## Social Share

The social share buttons on this site are just links to the respective social media sites. This site doesn't store or track the clicks and no cookies are present on this site to enable this.

## Forum

The forum on this site was locked a few years ago. The following measures have be taken to anonymise the content.

  * All signatures except my own have been blanked.
  * All email addresses have been altered to "me@example.com".
  * All usernames have been replaced by a generated username in the form "usernameNNNNN".
  * All IP addresses have been set to "127.0.0.1".



## Right to be Forgotten

It is possible you have included personal information on the site in one of the following locations.

  * Forum posts.
  * Article comments.
  * Blog comments.



These can easily be removed or amended by contacting me using the contact form [here](https://web.archive.org/misc/site-info#contactus).

## Data Breach Procedures

If you've got this far you will realise we don't keep any information other than that which is publicly visible on the site. As a result a breach is not possible in the conventional sense. In the event of the server being hacked there will be a post about it on the blog.

## General

The website is protected by HTTPS using a certificate from Let's Encrypt.

Hope this helps. Regards Tim...
