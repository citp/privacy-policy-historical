### INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US

  *  **Account Information** — We collect information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for or make purchases through the Services.

No matter which way you contact us you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.
  *  **Payment Information** — We collect certain payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we don't store ourselves but we collect via secure payment processing services.



### INFORMATION WE COLLECT WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES

  *  **Cookies and Analytics** — Ora and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners (Google Analytics), use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices.



### INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER USERS OR SERVICES

  *  **Other Ora users** — Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they mention you in a project or invite you to join a project or organization. For example, if a user invites you to join a project he/she will provide us with your email so that we can send an automatic email invite. Users can also mention you in a project or task that you are a member of.
  *  **Services you or an administrator links** — We receive information about you when you link a third-party service or integration to Ora. For example, if you link or signup with your Google/GitHub account we will use that to collect your name, email and profile picture. We receive different information from different integrations but the purpose remains the same, to provide you with a good service and enable features that boost your productivity. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
