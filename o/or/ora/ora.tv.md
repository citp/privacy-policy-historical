GENERAL WEBSITE TRAFFIC We keep track of total accesses to our site. All information gathered in this way is generic, and we do not track any individual users from this, but only calculate how many times the Site has been accessed. 

EMAIL IDENTIFICATION When a user sends a message to the Site, two pieces of information are automatically stamped on the message. These are, the time that the message was sent, and the Internet Provider (or IP) address it was sent from. This is done as a precaution against threatening emails we may receive that are directed towards Site staff, or anyone else. It is only ever used to find the source of a message in those extreme cases where we feel an individual’s safety may be at risk.
