2\. Types of Data Collection   
How Oracle collects Data related to our users: 

  * Through automated means such as communications protocols and cookies 
  * Registration screens and online forms 
  * In the process of online purchases (transaction records) and sales inquiries 
  * In e-mails sent to Oracle from users 
  * Through offline communications and interactions 
  * Oracle may also obtain data related to our users through third party sources of information, such as opt in lists. 



Oracle may receive data from you as part of the communication connection itself - the standard electronic greeting between your computer, the network, and our servers. This information often consists of network routing (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), date and time. At this time our server will also query your computer to see if there are "[cookies](http://www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html#cookies)1" previously set by Oracle.com to facilitate log in or other site navigation procedures. 

Some parts of the Oracle site use cookies to collect information about visitors' use of the Web site and to facilitate return visits. The information collected from cookies is tracked to enhance security and to improve the functionality of the Web site by avoiding duplicate data entry, facilitating navigation, and increasing the relevance of content. Cookies on the site may collect the following information: a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information used to personalize the content that is shown, and membership information to access Oracle's online communities. Some cookies used by Oracle.com may remain on the user's computer after they leave the Web site, but the majority are set to expire within [30 - 365 days](http://www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html#30days)2. There may be some cookies on certain tools (such as evaluator) that may be of longer duration 

Cookies may also be of benefit to you by creating a more streamlined login process, keeping track of shopping cart additions and preserving order information between sessions. In the future, as we enable further customization of the site, cookies will help in assuring that information provided to you will be the most relevant to your needs. 

Third Party Cookies: Oracle has engaged Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the website to help us administer our web site in order to constantly improve the web site quality.Omniture uses cookies to help track visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of Oracle that will be listed under the domain 2O7.net. Omniture does not use cookies to relate website visitors to any personally identifiable information and provides Oracle with information about site usage that reflects individual behavior of visitors, but not their identity.All data collected by Omniture on behalf of Oracle is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.

While this increases your ability to surf the site, it does not replace the functionality or streamlining of cookies and may limit your use of many convenience features offered by the site.

In an effort to provide users with the most relevant Web site content and marketing materials, we may also use embedded pixel technologies to help track site usage and marketing campaign responsiveness. On the Web site, these technologies are used on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits as opposed to aggregate hits.

When these technologies are used in e-mails, they provide information on when the e-mail was opened. In e-mails, these technologies are used to evaluate marketing campaign relevance to the user and to update marketing lists.

3\. The Data We Collect and How We Use It   
Oracle collects information from users for the following purposes: 

To engage in transactions or communications. Name, address, e-mail, purchase details, and credit card/payment information may be collected and stored as part of the transaction history. The majority of the information collected under this category is business contact information. Oracle may need to share some of this information (address, payment) with delivery services, credit card clearing houses and other similarly situated third parties that are required to accomplish the transaction. 

To provide future service and support. Information collected for this purpose is both contact information and information related to products and service/support requested. This information is also used to provide service, product update, and similar notices. 

As a result of product download. Users who download products under trial licenses and purchasers of products will be contacted to confirm they did not experience problems in the download process and will also be alerted at the end of the license period. These communications are not subject to the general opt-out of marketing notices.

To select content. Information may be collected to help create Web site content and navigation that is most relevant and user friendly. This includes information collected as a result of site navigation as well as information provided in forms. 

To respond to user inquiries and requests for information. This information includes registrations for newsletters and specific requests for further information. 

To provide various Oracle communities, such as partners, with relevant product alerts and updates. These updates are related to product releases, prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns. This information is sent out as part of the partner signing up for the relevant program or online account and is not subject to general opt-out. 

To better tailor marketing to user needs. We may use information from purchases and requirements to provide you with timely and pertinent notices of product releases and service developments that address your needs and requirements. Marketing notices are subject to the general opt-out elections. 

To better respond to requests for service or quotes for product and equipment purchase. Oracle will pass contact information to the appropriate Oracle sales person, distributor, reseller, or consultant for follow-up related to your request. Oracle may also ask if you wish to have your contact information shared with other selected partners that offer complementary products or services related to your inquiry. If you agree, information is provided to those partners for purpose of responding to your request for service or information. Please review the privacy policy of the specific partner regarding any further interactions with them. 

To provide information on educational events or relevant partner products. We occasionally co-sponsor events with partners that provide services of potential benefit to Oracle users. We may provide information on such events and services to users that have provided information indicating interest in the subject matter or service. To help assure respect of your information, we maintain control of the information or limit the use of the information by these partners. 

To power joint sales or product promotions.Oracle and its partners may engage in joint events or provide bundled products. Such promotions will always reference the partners [involved](http://www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html#promos)4. Both Oracle and the partner(s) will have access to that information.

As a result of your use of Outsourcing, Support or Consulting Services "Hosted Services". Some Oracle customers may provide information on their employees, vendors, or customers using various Hosted Services including Oracle E-Business Suite Online that we host and for which we provide application and systems management.

As a result of legal requirements. Oracle may be required to provide personally identifiable information to comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure or other legal process requirements. 

4.Customization, Preferences and Opt-Out   
Oracle allows visitors to self-select into communities, through the registration process, as a way to provide initial customization to the Oracle Web site. There are also plans to provide more control over preferences and information delivery in the registration process. 

Communications Choices. Oracle recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related products. Oracle.com allows you to opt-out of e-mail marketing that may result from use of the site. These choices may be made as part of the registration process or from links in marketing mailings. You may also always return to the registration profile to change your election relating to opt-out or by sending an email to our automated link [unsubscribe@oracle-mail.com](mailto:unsubscribe@oracle-mail.com). If you have any problems in using these opt-out mechanisms, please send an e-mail to [privacy_ww@oracle.com](mailto:privacy_ww@oracle.com), indicate opt-out in the subject line and specify what problem you have encountered in the body of the message. There are a few limited exceptions to the opt-out, but notice is provided that the service includes certain communications. These exceptions include: patch and product security update related communications, defined communications related to product download,specific communications that are part of the reason for a specific trading or user community - such as price/product related communications to the members of our partner network or trade opportunity postings on an exchange and some limited communications related to registration for and attendance at conferences. 

Third Party Permission-Based Lists. On occasion, Oracle may use a third party permission-based list. These are lists maintained by third parties that have received permissionfrom their users to receive e-mails from other companies, such as Oracle. We do not have access to the names on these lists as the third party that has the direct relationship with their user maintains the list and the opt-outs, removes, and unsubscribes to those lists. We require that the list owners we use identify themselves as the mailers of the e-mail and provide appropriate opt-out mechanisms. While we advise users of third party websites to avail themselves of the opt-out functionality provided in the particular e-mail, should you have trouble opting out, or should you wish to make us aware of any issues related to the mailing, you may contact us directly at any of the addresses provided below.

Information-Sharing Choices. Oracle only shares information with selected companies after providing users with an ability to either opt-out of or opt-in to the sharing. There are limitations to such opt-outs/opt-ins:in the case of joint sale or joint events where the information goes to both Oracle and the other party at the same time, where the customer has requested follow up which involves Oracle partners, and as needed with third parties required to accomplish the transaction including delivery and credit card clearing services. There may also be some cases of sharing by definition of the service - for example posting comments to a bulletin board or posting an opportunity to an exchange - that provides that information to all users.Other cases may include attendance at educational or conference events where third parties and Oracle partners may be involved in providing services or sponsorship of a conference, seminar, training session, or event. As we further develop our preference tools we will endeavor to have our partners join in their use to provide the user with a more seamless and streamlined environment. 

Please contact us at [privacy_ww@oracle.com](mailto:privacy_ww@oracle.com) if you believe you have mistakenly received information after opting-out or if you would like to opt-out of receiving information and have any trouble using the mechanisms provided on []() or via an e-mail link.

6\. Advertising    
Oracle uses some third parties to administer a limited set of Oracle advertisements on its Web sites. No personally identifiable information is passed back to the advertisers as part of this process, but aggregate profile information, such as user community, may be used in the selection of advertising to make sure that it has relevance to the user. On some banner ads an embedded pixel may be present, and while it does not associate with a cookie or other personal profile information, it may return session connection information that allows advertisers to better determine how many individual users have clicked on the ad banner.

Oracle is concerned with the security of the personally identifiable information we have collected and has in place reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to that information.
