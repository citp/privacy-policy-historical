# Privacy Policy | Organize.com

The Organize.com website is operated by Organize.com, Inc. and is the sole owner of all information collected on this site. Organize.com requests information from the Customer on an ordering form. The information that is collected to process and ship the order may include Contact information (including but not limited to: name, shipping address, telephone number, cell phone number, fax number and/or e-mail address) and financial information (including but not limited to: credit card number, name on account, billing address, and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. This Contact information is used to contact the Customer. Other than as discussed above and below, the personal information you provide us and information about your order will never be shared with third parties unless we are required to do so by law. This information may, however, be combined with other information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) and used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. In addition, Organize.com uses cookies and data collection pixels to gather anonymous information about our users and their interactions with our website. This data is used on an aggregate level to analyze our website's effectiveness and help us improve our services. A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID. Additionally, after you've entered your member ID and password during a session on our service, we save that information so you don't have to reenter it repeatedly during that session. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature. The Web Site and any e-mails sent by the Web Site may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons." These web beacons allow Organize.com and third parties to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Company's use of web beacons on its Web Sites, include, without limitation, the following:

• Counting unique users (actually, unique web browsers), visits and page views.   
• Monitoring traffic and conversion patterns through our various product and service offerings on the Web Sites. For example, web beacons may be integrated into a merchandise product page as well as the subsequent shopping cart, transaction and verification pages.   
• Personalizing your experience when you visit the Web Sites, including the advertising and content you see.   
• Determining whether or not e-mail messages were opened, links were clicked or notifications/offers were acted upon.
