# Shopping at Oreck.com is safe and easy - we protect your privacy.

At Oreck.com, we collect physical mailing addresses and email addresses from customers who purchase online. We also collect email addresses from those who register with My Account at Oreck.com and those who enter an Oreck.com sweepstakes or contest.

We use the information we collect to process online orders, provide a more personalized shopping experience, and notify you of special shopping offers, discounts and sweepstakes – only when you have specifically requested to receive email from us. When you place an order at Oreck.com, our secure server software (SSL) encrypts all the information you’ve input before it is sent to us, including your name, address and credit card number. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

If you do not want us to share your physical mailing address with other companies, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [privacy@oreck.com](mailto:privacy@oreck.com), and include your name and physical mailing address.
