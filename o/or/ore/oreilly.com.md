### Information O'Reilly Gathers and Tracks

O'Reilly collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with us. 

### Personal Information

We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on how you contact us: 

  * When you create an O'Reilly Network account or sign up to receive O'Reilly product news at [elists.oreilly.com](http://elists.oreilly.com/), you must provide your name, email address, and a password. We never sell or rent your email address or other personally identifiable information you provide when subscribing to our elists.

  * When you register for an [O'Reilly conference](http://conferences.oreilly.com/), or sign up for a [conference email list](http://conferences.oreilly.com/form.html), we will send you email announcements and updates about O'Reilly conferences. You can opt out of these email lists when you register. We send conference brochures to past conference attendees.

  * When you order books directly from us, or request book catalogs, we add you to our snailmail list, and we'll send you catalogs and other marketing pieces.

  * When you enter a contest, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.




We share customer information only with affiliated companies (see <http://www.oreilly.com/affiliates.html> and <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/q/all_affiliates>) and as described below: 

  * With third parties we retain to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, managing mailing lists, and delivering packages. These parties are restricted from using your information for any other purpose.

  * We rent our snailmail list for one-time use to third parties we deem relevant and appropriate. We do not rent or sell our email lists.

  * We release personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of O'Reilly & Associates, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
