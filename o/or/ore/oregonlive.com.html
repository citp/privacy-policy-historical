<b>HOW Oregon Live USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU: </b> This site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.

Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">
