Children's Privacy Protection  
Oregon Scientific takes special care to protect the privacy needs of children under the age of 13 and encourages parents to be an active participant in their child's online activities and interests. [Oregon Scientific.com](http://www.oregonscientific.com/) is a general audience web site.

When a child under the age of 13 attempts to provide information to Oregon Scientific, we ask that they have a parent or Guardian provide their consent first. This is done by emailing the parent or Guardian a notice which details: 

  1. Who is collecting the information;   

  2. What information is being collected;   

  3. The purpose behind the collection of the information; and   

  4. The parent's choices regarding the collection and use of the information.   

  5. We will only collect information from children under the age of thirteen once we receive parental consent. We do not share any information collected from children under the age of 13 with third parties.



If a parent provides his or her consent for their child to disclose information to Oregon Scientific, that parent may at any time review the information, ask to have it deleted or refuse to allow further collection. These requests should be made by emailing at the following email address: [info@oregonscientific.com](mailto:info@oregonscientific.com).

Oregon Scientific may collect personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, for registration purposes for services such as the Oregon Scientific service or for promotions and contests. In the case of online promotions and other activities, we do not condition a child's participation on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. The information is not disclosed to anyone outside of Oregon Scientific and is stored in a secure environment.
