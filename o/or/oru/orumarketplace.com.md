We use the information you provide about yourself when executing a transaction, only to complete that transaction. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that transaction, such as shipping and delivery companies.

We use the information you provide about someone else when creating a transaction only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that transaction.
