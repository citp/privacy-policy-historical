## Use of Cookies and Browser-Level Information

A “cookie” is a small piece of information that a website can store in a designated file on your computer or Web-enabled device. Cookies can be used, among other things, to identify your computer or device, sometime across multiple devices, when you log into a website and may track your IP address (which provides general location data).

When you visit our websites, we use cookies to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors to our site and the number of pages viewed. While Visit Orlando does analysis of its website logs to monitor the flow of traffic and make improvements to the sites content, its website logs are not personally identifiable, and no attempt is made to link them to individual visitors to this site. This information is used only by Visit Orlando and its agents or contractors and is not shared with any third-party companies. Our service providers may use tracking tools such as cookies to track your IP address in order to monitor how effective our advertisements are at inspiring you to visit Orlando. If you wish to opt out of cookies that allow us to serve our advertisements while you are in Orlando, and collect aggregate information on arrivals, click [Here](http://dc.arrivalist.com/optout/).

If you register through one of our websites, we place a unique identifier cookie that is used to maintain your “sign on” status for the duration of your visit to the site, customise or tailor your visit and to store your user preferences for that site over time. We may also use cookies to track the pages visited so that we can deliver web content based on a visitor’s profile (as provided by the visitor) and the visitor’s past activity on that site. The use of these cookies also enables our sites to “remember” the items that visitors add to their shopping carts as they browse elsewhere on the site, to alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to the site, to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customise the web page content based on a visitor’s browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

Through your use of the Visit Orlando site and other online or mobile services, you are providing express consent to the use of cookies in the manner described above.

## Clickstream Data

We collect clickstream data and HTTP protocol elements through access logs. This information is not personally identifiable and is used for website and system administration, including research and development, user analysis and business decision-making.

## “How do I opt out?”: Choices about Data Collection and Use

By providing Visit Orlando with your email address you provide Visit Orlando with your implied consent to receive email communications about new Visit Orlando products and services, third party offers we may send you, or other promotional Visit Orlando communications.

If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt-out by sending an email request to privacy@VisitOrlando.com. In your email, please indicate which mode(s) of communication you would like to opt-out of (postal mail, email or telephone contact). If you are visiting other websites and see an advertisement from Visit Orlando, there will be an opportunity to opt-out of future Visit Orlando ads on that site as managed by the third party provider through its opt-out function.

## Access and Correction

Upon your request, we will provide you with the opportunity to review and correct the contact and payment information that we maintain about you. We will accommodate all reasonable requests.

Visit Orlando reserves the right to refuse any request for information which: 

  * would reveal personal information about another individual;

  * would reasonably be expected to harm an individual’s life or security; 
  * was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process;
