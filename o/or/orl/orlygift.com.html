            <strong>User Postings</strong>
            <p>
                Except as otherwise expressly described in this Privacy Policy, this policy only addresses the use and disclosure of Personal Information and other information we collect from you. In the course of your use of the Website, including when you create a
                profile on the Website, you may elect to post or otherwise disclose information about yourself and others, which may include Personal Information or other personally identifiable information. You may also elect to communicate with others
                or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected
                or used by others. Such postings may also appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, although www.orlygift.com restricts access to portions of the Website to members of the Service, since the Service is offered through and accessible through a number of other websites in addition to the Website, any information that you post
                to the Website for access by members of the Website may be searchable and available to users of the Service who access it via different websites from the Website. You may also receive unsolicited messages from other parties as a result
                of such disclosure. Such activities are beyond the control of Www.orlygift.com and this Privacy Policy. You should therefore exercise discretion and extreme caution when disclosing any Personal Information or other information when using
                the Website or the Service.

                In addition, we set strict security standards to prevent any unauthorized access to your Personal Information once we have received it and wherever possible we will use adequate security software and working procedures to ensure the security of your personal
                data. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and ensure proper use of Personal Information, we have employed physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we collect online.
                These measures include limiting the number of people who have physical access to www.orlygift.com database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections which guard against unauthorized access.

            <strong>Children's Online Privacy</strong>
            <p>
                It is important to Www.orlygift.com that parents and guardians have control over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is or may be used. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") imposes
                restrictions on commercial websites, including ours. It is our policy to be compliant with the requirements of COPPA and not to solicit or collect information about or from children age 13 and under.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the requirements of COPPA, we require that individuals be age 18 or over to register as a member of the Service and thus it is our policy not to solicit or collect information about or from anyone under the age of 18. Users are cautioned, however,
                that absent a clear indication an online communication has been submitted by a person under age 18, the collection of Personal Information submitted to the Website will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless
                exempted from access by federal or state law, be subject to public access.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event that www.orlygift.com receives an online communication clearly indicating that it has been submitted by a person under the age of 18, under no circumstances will any Personal Information be published on the Website, be used for a purpose
                not intended by its sender or shared with third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you or your company would like more information about COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission's official COPPA page at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">www.ftc.gov</a>.

            <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
            <p>
                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
                Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

                We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only those individuals
                have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
