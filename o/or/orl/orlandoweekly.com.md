# Privacy Statement for Orlando Weekly

**Privacy Statement for Orlando Weekly**

Orlando Weekly has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information-gathering and dissemination practices. 

**Site usage and tracking**

Orlando Weekly does internal research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration and from our server log files. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. 

**Customization**

Orlando Weekly gives users with the ability to personalize the site's content through a [customization](https://web.archive.org/web/20011205072555id_/http%3A//orlandoweekly.com/customize) process. 

In order to customize Orlando Weekly for our users, some information (e.g. name and e-mail address) and demographic information is necessary to activate personalized services. 

We use the e-mail address in the registration form to send users content they have specifically requested and to award winners in contests related to customizing. All contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws. Users may unsubscribe from Orlando Weekly e-mail services at any time (see the choice/opt-out section below). 

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content they requested. Demographic information is shared with advertisers only as aggregate information. We do not sell or share any personal data.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small data file that certain sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself (such as content preferences). A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 

Orlando Weekly uses cookies to deliver content and services that users request during the customization and shopping processes. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser and continue to use the site; however, some functionality related to personalization and shopping may not be available while cookies are deactivated. Advertising networks that serve ads on Orlando Weekly may also use their own cookies. 

**Shopping**

Orlando Weekly has partnered with [Internet Tradeline](http://www.tradeline.net/) to bring you local shopping. 

To ensure safety and confidentiality, our shopping area utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, the industry standard for transferring sensitive information over the Internet. When you enter your credit-card information online, it is encrypted before it is sent. In this process, no person ever sees your credit-card number, and there is an extremely low risk of interception. This system makes purchasing on the web even safer than purchasing by telephone or shopping in stores, where several people have access to hard copies of your actual card number. While shopping, whenever we ask you to send confidential information over the Internet, including personal-account data, we require that a "secure session" using SSL first be established. Most of the newer browsers contain SSL technology, but you may need to download a more recent version if your system is unable to establish a secure connection. Additionally, users behind a corporate firewall may encounter problems establishing a connection to our secure site. 

**Partnerships**

From time to time, Orlando Weekly will partner with reputable technology or content companies to offer users more extensive services. This privacy policy will be modified at that time to reflect any changes those relationships require (additional registration information, cookies, etc.). 

**Links**

This site contains links to other sites. Orlando Weekly is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other sites. 

**Message boards**

This site makes message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Users of the Orlando Weekly message boards must register separately for these services (free of charge) in order to post messages, although they need not register to read others' messages. During message-board registration, users are required to supply a username, password, and e-mail address. For additional information, please see our [message board rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20011205072555id_/http%3A//orlandoweekly.com/scripts/Ultimate.cgi?action=agree). 

**Security**

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Orlando Weekly cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

**Choice/Opt-out**

Orlando Weekly provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service.
