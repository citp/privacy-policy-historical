We receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:

You may also choose to provide your fax number, date of birth, job title, website, country, a company contact person, and other information.

  2. ‘Contact Us’ or ‘Update’ request Information. If you send us a “contact us” request or “request to receive updates” we will receive and store a copy of your name, email address, telephone, and country, as well as any other Personal Information that you choose to disclose.
