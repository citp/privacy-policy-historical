						<br>
						Welcome to <font class="E">orkut.com</font>, a personal online networking 
						service operated by orkut.com LLC ("<b>orkut</b>"). Your privacy is important 
						to us and we have designed <font class="E">orkut.com</font> to give you choices 
						about the personal information available on this site. This <b>Privacy Policy</b>
						explains how we collect, use and share your personal identifying information. 
						Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions we 
						suggest you read this <a href="http://help.orkut.com/bin/topic.py?topic=10" target="_blank">FAQ</a> or feel free to <a href="mailto:help@orkut.com">contact 
							us</a>.
						<br>
						<br>
						By using <font class="E">orkut.com</font>, you consent to the collection and 
						use of your personal information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. From time 
						to time, we may update the Privacy Policy and we will post a notice of 
						significant changes on the site. You should visit this page periodically to 
						review any such changes to the Privacy Policy.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>information we collect</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						When you register to become a member of orkut.com, we collect your name, email 
						address and other personal identifying information that you submit to the site. 
						Also, as part of your personal profile, you may choose to submit additional 
						information such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, etc. and other 
						content, such as photos. This additional information is voluntary and can be 
						made available to other members. To protect your privacy, the <font class="E">orkut.com</font>
						service allows you to limit who can view certain personal information, such as 
						email address, instant messaging name or telephone number. These restricted 
						viewing options are identified by the "golden key" icon. <img src="img/i_key.gif">
						<br>
						<br>
						When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the <font class="E">
							orkut.com</font> service, we collect and maintain the information 
						associated with those messages, including email addresses and content on secure 
						servers. As with any social networking service, you should use care when 
						disclosing your personal information to strangers. Be advised that if you send 
						messages or post material containing personal information, that information may 
						be collected and used by others. In order to provide the best possible service 
						and detect and correct site errors, we collect aggregate information about use 
						of the site (such as which page are most often viewed) and we collect 
						information about your computer, such as such as browser type, browser 
						language, and IP address.
						<br>
						<br>

						members can view each other's viewable profile information to learn about 
						people in their network and reach out to members. When you send messages 
						through the&nbsp;<font class="E">orkut.com</font>&nbsp; service, your name and

						email address to notify you of new members, messages or other information, such 
						as an invitation to join a friend's network; a new testimonial or "fan" rating; 
						crush notices, etc. In addition, we will send you messages when there are 
						substantive changes to the service or our policies. All of these messages can 
						be sent to your primary email address or to your orkut.com inbox by setting 
						your preferences on the "my settings" page.
