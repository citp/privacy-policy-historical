In principle, we process personal data of our users only insofar as this is necessary to provide a functioning website and our content and services.

An exception applies to cases in which prior consent can not be obtained for reasons of fact and the processing of the data is permitted by law.

In the process, user profiles can be created from the processed data. We therefore have no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore informs the users according to our knowledge.

By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example, press the Like button or leave a comment, the information is transmitted from your device directly to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save their IP address. According to Facebook, only an anonymous IP address is stored in Germany.

The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and setting options for protecting the privacy of users, can be found in Facebook’s privacy policy: [https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=de&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=de&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/&xid=17259,15700023,15700124,15700149,15700168,15700173,15700186,15700191,15700201,15700205&usg=ALkJrhisilUl5mKpQepstV3CTFwucSsHsw) ,
