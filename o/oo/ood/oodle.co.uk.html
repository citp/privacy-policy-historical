<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
Your privacy is important to us, so Oodle has created this Privacy Policy to explain how your information is protected, collected and used.  This Privacy Policy applies to our web sites, including our publicly accessible web sites located at <a href="/">oodle.com</a> (the "Sites").    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  You can always review the most current version at <a href="/info/privacy/">http://www.oodle.com/info/privacy/</a>.  By using the Sites, you consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policies may evolve in the future.  If there is a conflict between our Terms of Use governing your use of the Sites and this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use control.

<h2>Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
In various places on the Sites, we collect "Personally Identifiable Information," such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other information that can be used to identify you or contact you.  
<ul>
<li>Oodle will not share any of your Personally Identifiable Information, except for the information you choose to publicly disclose in the listings you publish, with our advertisers or any third-parties for marketing purposes.</li>
<li>Oodle offers email anonymization &amp; relay to protect your identity and reduce spam.</li>
<li>Account information is password protected.  Keep your password safe.</li>
<li>Oodle does not knowingly collect any Personally Identifiable Information from persons under the age of 13, and Oodle does not permit persons under the age of 13 to register on the Sites.  If Oodle learns that a listing is by a person under the age of 13, Oodle will remove that listing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oodle, or people that place listings on Oodle, may provide links to third party web sites, which may have different privacy practices than Oodle.  We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies on these third party web sites.  We encourage all users to read the privacy policies of every web site you visit.
</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>
Registration is required to place a listing through our service or to use other types of functionality that require the service to recognize a user (e.g., Oodle Alerts).   If you decide to register or sign up for certain services, you will need to give us certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as a valid e-mail address and zip code.  You will also have the option to provide other Personally Identifiable Information such as your address.   This Personally Identifiable Information will be used to personalize and improve your experience of our service.   This information will not be disclosed to any third-party without your explicit consent.
<p>
Registered users may choose to receive a copy of our newsletter or receive other mailings from us regarding our service or the Sites.    You may opt-out of receiving future mailings as part of the registration process.
</p>
<p>
You can review and change your Personally Identifiable Information or password at any time by going to our "My Oodle" page at <a href="/my/">http://www.oodle.com/my/</a>.
</p>


<h2>Cookies</h2>
Like many web sites, Oodle uses a standard technology call "cookies."  A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive that can be accessed by a specific web site to make your experience quicker and more convenient.   Cookies allow our users to login without entering their ID and password each time they use Oodle.   Cookies also help us understand how our users use the Sites, which allows us to improve the service.  We do not use cookies to retrieve any information from your computer other than the information we provide, such as a user code.  


<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
In addition to Personally Identifiable you provide at registration or by using the service, we collect the following information:
<ul>
<li>Listings content.   When you place a listing or a review on Oodle, we collect a variety of information related to that listing (e.g., price, model).   The public will see any information that you include in your listing, and as such, Oodle has no control over how this information will be used.  For that reason, please think carefully about what Personally Identifiable Information you disclose in your listing.  You can always edit any of your listings at <a href="/my/">http://www.oodle.com/my/</a>.</li>
<li>"Anonymous Information" such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you visit, the search terms that you enter and the advertisements that you click.  This information is used to help us diagnose problems, administer the site and otherwise improve our service to you.  </li>
<li>Credit card information.  Credit card information is collected but not stored.  It is transmitted to a financial gateway using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data We Store</h2>
The following information is stored in our database, even after deletion, and may be archived:
<ul>
<li>Registration information</li>
<li>All listings and review content</li>
<li>Activity logs and other records</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although we make good faith efforts to store information in a secure environment that is not made available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.
</p>


<h2>Circumstance in Which We Will Release Information</h2>
Oodle may disclose information about its users if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
<ul>
<li>Respond to a legal process (e.g., subpoenas, court orders)</li>
<li>Respond to claims that a listing or content violates the rights of third parties</li>
<li>Enforce our <a href="/info/terms/">Terms of Use</a></li>
<li>Protect the rights, property or personal safety of Oodle, its users or the general public</li>
</ul>
<p>
If we merge with or are acquired by another company, the resulting combined company will use the information you have provided as described in this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
