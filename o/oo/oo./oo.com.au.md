oo.com.au, referred to below as OO, is an online retailer of consumer goods.

OO values our relationship with you and the other users of this website. We recognize that you may be concerned about our collection, use, and disclosure of your personally identifiable information that we may collect when you use the Web Site. Accordingly, we have implemented this Privacy Policy to inform you of the information that we collect from you, how we collect this information, and what we do with it after we collect it.

**OO's Commitment to Online Security**  
Your personal information is treated with the greatest of care. Sensitive payment information such as credit card details are NEVER stored on the Internet with our system. Once you type your information, it is sent instantly, encrypted, directly to our order processing system. We employ the latest 1024-bit encryption technology in all areas of the site which require you to provide payment information. This is done to protect you from unauthorized use of the information you are sending to our server. This website is registered with site identification authorities to enable your browser to confirm our security identity before any transmission is sent. With this technology, the identity of this site is automatically confirmed behind the scenes prior to the transmission of any sensitive information requested to complete an online order and ensures that your data reaches your intended target or your browser notifies you that the potential receiving site looks suspicious and should be avoided.

Physical, electronic and managerial procedures have been employed to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information. The OO website encrypts sensitive information wherever OO requests it. OO employs a third party (HackerSafe) to monitor the security of our web servers to alert us to any weaknesses before hackers find them.

**Personal Information that OO May Collect Online**  
OO collects personal information online, including names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers and billing information. OO may also collect business information from sole proprietorships that apply for membership and for program participation, some of which could constitute personal information, as well as personal information from individuals acting solely in their business capacity.

**How OO Uses Personal Information Collected Online**  
Unless you otherwise consent, we will use your personal information only for the purpose for which it is submitted, such as to reply to your emails and process billing. Our research may lead to the publication of aggregate demographical data but will not result in the reporting or publication of any personal information provided to us.

**How Your Information May Be Shared**  
We never sell or rent your personal information. OO may release personal information under the following circumstances:   


  * Where release is required by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation or is requested by a government agency;
  * Where our records indicate a company or an individual may be engaged in fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of;
  * To appropriate persons, where your communication suggests possible harm to others



**Computer Tracking and Cookies**  
This website is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information not entered by visitors. Our site logs do generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to our sites. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff to provide better services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

**Email Newsletter Subscription**  
We employ a double opt-in subscription program for our email newsletters. Upon registration, you will receive a confirmation email to the email address you gave us with a link contained within it or instructions for completing the subscription process. You will not be fully subscribed to the newsletter until you click through the link in the email we sent you or otherwise follow the instructions contained therein. In order to make our emails more relevant and useful to you, our servers may receive a confirmation when you open email from us. 

**Changes to this Privacy Notice, Conditions of Use and Notices**
