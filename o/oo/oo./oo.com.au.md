OO's Commitment to Online Security

Your personal information is treated with the greatest of care. Sensitive payment information such as credit card details are NEVER stored on the Internet with our system. Once you type your information, it is sent instantly, encrypted, directly to our order processing system.

This is done to protect you from unauthorized use of the information you are sending to our server. This website is registered with site identification authorities to enable your browser to confirm our security identity before any transmission is sent. With this technology, the identity of this site is automatically confirmed behind the scenes prior to the transmission of any sensitive information requested to complete an online order and ensures that your data reaches your intended target or your browser notifies you that the potential receiving site looks suspicious and should be avoided.

Physical, electronic and managerial procedures have been employed to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information. The OO website encrypts sensitive information wherever OO requests it. OO employs a third party (HackerSafe) to monitor the security of our web servers to alert us to any weaknesses before hackers find them.
