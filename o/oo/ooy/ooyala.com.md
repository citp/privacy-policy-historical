# Ooyala - Privacy Policy

**Last updated: March 1, 2008**

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Ooyala, its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as "Ooyala") uses and protects the information you provide. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to this World Wide Web site and any variations or successors to this website (www.ooyala.com, the "Ooyala Site"), any Ooyala computer software downloadable or otherwise available from the Ooyala Site ("Ooyala Software") and any Ooyala services purchased or otherwise made available from the Ooyala Site ("Ooyala Services") (collectively, the "Ooyala Properties"). This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to all Users ("Users") of the Ooyala Properties.  


A. WHAT INFORMATION OOYALA COLLECTS FROM YOU

Ooyala may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal.

> **1\. "Personal Information."** Personal Information refers to information that lets Ooyala know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g. name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address). Ooyala may collect Personal Information when you use the Ooyala Properties including, without limitation, setting up account information, filling out surveys, corresponding with Ooyala, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.
> 
> **2\. "Non-Personal Information."** Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or website visitations). Ooyala may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.  
> 

B. HOW OOYALA COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION

The Personal Information practices set forth apply to all Ooyala's customers worldwide.

> **1\. Registration.** Prior to using one or more of the Ooyala Properties, Ooyala may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an individual account ("Account") or to enable features or functionality of the Ooyala Properties. Failure to provide all required information required by Ooyala may prevent access to any or all Ooyala Properties, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all Ooyala Properties. 
> 
> **2\. Information Collected Through Technology.** While you are able to visit the Ooyala Site and remain anonymous, Ooyala or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Ooyala Properties (e.g. your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). Such information may be gathered by the following methods:
>
>> **(a) Cookies.** Cookies, including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive which work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the Ooyala Site. Cookies do not generally contain any Personal Information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Ooyala Properties unavailable to you.
>> 
>> **(b) IP Address.** You may visit many areas of the Ooyala Site anonymously without the need to become a registered User. Even in such cases, Ooyala may collect IP addresses automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin Services with an Internet services provider. Each time you access the Ooyala Site and each time you request one of Ooyala's pages, the server logs your IP address.
>> 
>> **(c) Web Beacons.** Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails. Ooyala may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that Ooyala sends to Users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.
>> 
>> **(d) Tracking Content Usage.** If you use the Ooyala Services and you post audio visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property contained in such materials (collectively, "Content") to your website or to a third party website, Ooyala tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User accounts and the use of Content.  
> 

C. HOW OOYALA USES YOUR INFORMATION

> **1\. System Administration.** Ooyala may use Non-Personal Information for the purposes of system administration, assisting in diagnosing problems with Ooyala servers, monitoring Ooyala's system performance and traffic on the Ooyala Properties and to gather broad demographic information about Ooyala customers.
> 
> **2\. Personalization.** Ooyala uses Cookies and IP Addresses to track features such as delivering Content specific to your interests and informing you of new, relevant services or certain third party offerings.
> 
> **3\. Notices to Registered Users.** If you have registered for an Account, Ooyala may use your Personal Information to send e-mails regarding your registration, including confirmation to verify the accuracy of any information you have provided, and instructions on how to post Content. Ooyala may also send you e-mails to verify your identity or to notify you if Ooyala believes your use of Ooyala Properties violates any applicable agreement for the use of the Ooyala Properties.
> 
> **4\. Advertising.** Ooyala may use Non-Personal Information to assist in optimizing the delivery of advertisements to viewers of your Content.
> 
> **5\. Promotional E-mails.** Ooyala may use your Personal Information to send you e-mails periodically listing promotions or events relating to the Ooyala Properties or from Ooyala's marketing partners or sponsors. You have the choice to opt-out of receiving such promotional e-mails by sending an e-mail to [help@ooyala.com](mailto:help@ooyala.com) and/or following the instructions in such correspondence. Once Ooyala's has processed your opt-out request, Ooyala will not send you promotional e-mails unless you opt back in to receiving such communications.

D. HOW TO ACCESS AND CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Upon request, Ooyala shall allow Users to update or correct Personal Information previously submitted, but only to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Additionally, upon request, Ooyala shall delete Personal Information from the database where such information is stored; however, it may be impossible to entirely delete a User's entry without some residual information being retained due to the manner in which data backups are maintained. Requests to delete Personal Information shall be submitted to [help@ooyala.com](mailto:help@ooyala.com).  


E. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

Ooyala does not sell, trade or rent Personal Information collected through the Ooyala Properties to any third party.

> 
> **2\. Third Party Links.** The Ooyala Properties may contain links to third parties who may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information directly from you. Additionally, Ooyala may use third parties to provide components of the Ooyala Properties.

G. CHANGES TO OOYALA'S PRIVACY POLICY

Ooyala continually strives to implement new technologies and processes to better protect you, your privacy and your use of the Ooyala Properties. As a result, changes to this Privacy Policy may be made by Ooyala from time to time. In no event will these changes result in the degradation of any of the security measures designed to protect you from unauthorized disclosure, as such measures are described in this Privacy Policy.  


H. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE

Use of the Ooyala Properties is not intended for minors under the age of 18 ("Minors"). Minors are not authorized by Ooyala to use the Ooyala Properties, even if Minors set up an Account or accept the terms of any agreement for Ooyala Properties. Parents or guardians may authorize Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 to use the Ooyala Properties, provided they assume all responsibility and legal liability for the conduct of such Minor including, without limitation, monitoring the Minor's access and use of the Ooyala Properties. Ooyala does not intentionally collect nor maintain any personally identifiable information from Minors. If you discover your Minor child has submitted his/her information to Ooyala, you may request to have such information deleted from Ooyala's database by sending an e-mail request to [help@ooyala.com](mailto:help@ooyala.com) together with the e-mail address that was submitted by the Minor. Upon receiving the request, Ooyala shall delete such information within twenty (20) business days. If Ooyala learns that a Minor is using the Ooyala Properties, Ooyala will require verified parental or guardian consent, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA").
