						<h1>OCEAN SAFETY LIMITED PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
						 
						<p><strong>Information about our organisation and
website</strong></p>

<p>Ocean Safety ("OS") respects your privacy and is committed to
protecting it. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our
policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way
your information is collected online and how that information is
used. OS is notified as a data controller with the UK Information
Commissioner (registration number icn841) and details of OS's
notification can be viewed on the website <a href="http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/">www.dataprotection.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Data automatically collected</strong></p>

<p>We log each User's domain and IP address automatically; this
information allows us to log the activity of each User and to
determine the date of each User's first log on, number of repeat
visits, areas of the Website visited. We use this information
internally for the sole purpose of evaluating the performance of
the Website and how the Website is used.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer as
a result of visiting a web site. This allows the site to know that
you have visited before and in some cases can be used to record
your preferences.</p>

<p>We use cookies to remember the information which you input each
time you use the Website and to store preferences entered by you
for the sole purpose of personalising your visit to the Website and
making it easier for you to use the Website. We also use cookies to
measure the frequency of User visits to the Website.</p>

<p>Two types of cookies are used on this Website:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Session Cookies, which are temporary cookies that only remain
until your browser is closed. They are used by our web application
in order to maintain the information relating to your transaction
from page to page following any input, such as when information is
completed over several screens; and</li>

<li>Cookies used to save your selections made when using the
Product search facility of the Website.<br>
You can still use most of this Website with cookies turned off. To
stop cookies being placed on your terminal equipment refer to your
specific internet browser. In a few cases blocking cookies may
reduce the functionality of some sites or prevent access to them
depending on your chosen browser options. Cookies can also easily
be deleted through your specific internet browser, although this
means your settings will not be retained.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data collection and use</strong></p>

<p>When you request information through this Website, we may need
to know some personal information about you. When emailing us, or
subscribing for free news or information we need your e-mail
address, name and other limited personal identifiers, typically
name and contact number. When using the secure areas of the
Website, Users and Customers will be required to enter their credit
or debit card number, home address, delivery address where
applicable and e-mail address.</p>

<p>We will ensure that collection and use of that personal
information strictly accords with the principles of data protection
and data privacy contained in the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and
EU Directive 95/46/EC which governs the collection, use and
handling of personal data and gives you certain rights including
the right to request access to the data that we hold on you and to
have any errors corrected.</p>

<p>Any information which you submit on the Website will be used
solely for the purposes of either administering your contract for
sale of a product between you and OS or, if you have requested
information from OS, providing that information to you.</p>

<p>From time to time we conduct market research using the Website
and we may ask you for information for these purposes. We cannot
identify you from such information and any information you submit
in response to any such request will be gathered, stored and used
on an anonymous basis. Please note we will not send you marketing
material unless you have requested it.</p>

<p><strong>Data retention</strong></p>

<p>Personal information you submit on the Website will be held only
for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which you have
given that data. If you have provided contact details for the
purposes of receiving news and information from us, we will contact
you from time to time to confirm that we have the correct details
for you and each time we contact you we will ask if you wish to opt
out of receiving any further information from us.</p>

<p>We are only allowed to store your data for only so long as is
necessary having regard to the purpose of the processing. We may
therefore delete your data after a reasonable period of time and,
if you have not used the website for some time, you may have to
re-enter your data.</p>

have any questions relating to OS's data Privacy Policy please

post at the following address: Customer Services, Ocean Safety

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>We have implemented security policies, rules and technical
measures to protect the personal information that we have under our
control. The security measures are designed to prevent unauthorised
access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification and
unlawful destruction or accidental loss.</p>

<p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong></p>

Privacy Policy does not cover the personal information you choose
to give to unrelated third parties. We encourage you to review the
privacy policy of any company or other entity operating a website
before submitting your personal information. Some third party
companies may choose to share their personal information with OS;
that sharing is governed by that third party company's privacy
policy.</p>
