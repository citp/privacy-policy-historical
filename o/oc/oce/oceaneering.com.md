#####  **DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS**

Where required by applicable law, you have the right to obtain confirmation that we maintain certain  
Personal Data relating to you, to verify its content, origin, and accuracy, as well as the right to access,  
review, port, delete, block or withdraw consent to the processing of certain Personal Data (without  
affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal), by contacting us as  
detailed below. In particular, you have the right to object to our use of your Personal Data for direct  
marketing, and in certain other situations at any time. Contact us below for more details. Please note  
that we need to retain certain Personal Data as required or permitted by applicable law.

#####  **DATA SECURITY**

We maintain reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from loss,  
misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction. However, no security measure can guarantee against  
compromise. You also have an important role in protecting your Personal Data. You should not share  
your username and password with anyone, and you should not re-use passwords across more than  
one website. If you have any reason to believe that your username or password has been  
compromised, please contact us as detailed below.

#####  **CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS**

We transfer Personal Data to various jurisdictions as necessary for the purposes described above,  
including to jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home  
country. We provide appropriate protections for cross-border transfers as required by applicable law for  
international data transfers. With respect to transfers originating from the European Economic Area  
("EEA"), we implement standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, and other  
appropriate solutions to address cross-border transfers as required by applicable law. Where required  
by such laws, you may request a copy of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us  
as detailed below.

#####  **OTHER ISSUES**

 _What is the legal basis of processing?_  
Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for collecting and processing Personal  
Data. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data,  
including:

  1. as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we respond to your requests);
  2.  as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use Personal Data for recordkeeping to  
substantiate tax liability);
  3. consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law, such as for direct  
marketing or certain cookies); and
  4. necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally, including  
maintaining the safety and security of the Site).



With respect to legitimate interests, given that we are a B2B company, we typically collect and process  
limited Personal Data about customer contacts and other individuals acting in their business capacities,  
as part of our overall effort to reduce the privacy impact on individuals.

 _What are the consequences of not providing Personal Data?_  
You are not required to provide all Personal Data identified in this Privacy Policy to use our Site or to  
interact with us offline, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide certain  
Personal Data. If you do not provide certain Personal Data, we may not be able to respond to your  
requests, perform a transaction with you, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find  
valuable.

 _Do we engage in automated decision-making without human intervention?_  
Except with regard to certain recruitment activities, which are detailed in a separate privacy statement,  
we do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that  
produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.

 _Does the Site honor do not track ("DNT") signals sent via browsers?_  
Yes, we DO honor DNT signals.

 _How long do we retain Personal Data?_  
We typically retain Personal Data related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing  
communications from us and then generally for up to 2 years. After 2 years, or upon request, we will  
generally securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law. For Personal Data that we  
collect and process for other purposes, as described above, we typically retain such Personal Data for  
no longer than the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and as  
otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, compliance, employment, litigation, and other legal rights  
and obligations.

 _Are third party websites governed by this Privacy Policy?_  
This Site contains links and references to other websites administered by unaffiliated third parties. This  
Privacy Policy does not apply to such third party websites. When you click a link to visit a third party  
website, you will be subject to that website's privacy practices. We encourage you to familiarize  
yourself with the privacy and security practices of any linked third party websites before providing any  
Personal Data on those websites.

 _How does Oceaneering handle employee and contractor privacy issues?_  
Personal Data about our employees and contractors are addressed through internal company policies  
and procedures, and are outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.

 _How will we handle any changes to this Privacy Policy?_  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time-to-time as our services and privacy practices change, or  
as required by law. The effective date of our Privacy Policy is posted below, and we encourage you to  
visit our Site periodically to stay informed about our privacy practices. We will post the updated version  
of the Privacy Policy on our Site, and ask for your consent to the changes if legally required.

Company page Since our founding in the early 1960s, Oceaneering has expanded and grown globally to service several industries such as the offshore energy industry, defense, entertainment, material handling, aerospace, science, and renewable energy industries. In 1964, Mike Hughes and Johnny Johnson formed a Gulf of Mexico diving company called World Wide Divers. The company grew in response to increasing demand for their services and in 1969 merged with two other diving companies to form Oceaneering International, Inc. To solve the toughest challenges, we do things differently, creatively, and smarter. As your trusted partner, our unmatched experience and truly innovative portfolio of technologies and solutions give us the flexibility to adapt and evolve, regardless of market conditions. Our mission is to solve the unsolvable. We thrive by creating industry-changing technically creative solutions for the most complex operational challenges under water, on land, and in space. Our five core values establish a common culture and demonstrate what is most important for us as a company. Since the beginning, the company has transformed from a small regional diving company into a global provider of engineered products and services. Today, we develop products and services for use throughout the lifecycle of an offshore oilfield, from drilling to decommissioning. We operate the world's premier fleet of work class ROVs. Additionally, we are a leader in offshore oilfield maintenance services, umbilicals, subsea hardware, and tooling. We also serve the aerospace, defense, and theme park industries. Underpinning everything we do, safety is not only the foundation of our core values, but it is vital to our unmatched performance record and company culture. The industries we serve are as diverse as they are complex. Whether we are engineering deepwater umbilicals or developing robotics for aerospace applications, the safety and health of our employees, vendors, and customers is an integral part of our day-to-day business. If we are working, then our responsibility is to be working safely. Since our inception in 1964, we have placed a high value on employee safety—from diving services and subsea inspection to vessel-based installation operations. We have and will continue to evolve not only our health, safety, and environmental (HSE) processes, but those of the industries in which we work. Although we have been fatality-free since 1999, our HSE journey goes beyond statistics. As our portfolio of services has grown, we have continued to prioritize and advance our approach to HSE.
