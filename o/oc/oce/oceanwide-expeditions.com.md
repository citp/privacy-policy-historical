To make it easier to manage your reservations, you can open a user account. This allows you to save your personal settings, review previous orders and manage future requests.

When you visit our website, even if you don't make a booking, we may collect certain information, like your IP address, which browser you’re using, and information about your computer’s operating system, application version, language settings and pages that have been shown to you. If you're using a mobile device, we might also collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific settings and characteristics, and latitude/longitude details.

## Why does oceanwide-expeditions.com collect, use and share your personal data?

Reservations: First and foremost, we use your personal data to complete and administer your online booking.

Customer Service: We provide international customer service from our offices in more than 5 languages. Sharing your details with our customer service staff allows us to respond when you need us.

Traveler Reviews: We use your contact information to invite you by email to write a guest review after your voyage. This can help other travelers choose the vayage that suit them best.

Account Administration: We offer a user account facility on our website. We use the information you give us to administer this, allowing you to manage your bookings, take advantage of special offers, make future requests more easily and manage your personal settings. Managing personal settings allows you to keep and share lists, share photos, see voyages you've searched for before, and see other information you've provided about voyages and destinations. It also allows you to see any reviews you've submitted about destinations you've been to. If you want, you can share certain information in your user account by creating a public profile that’s associated with either your own first name or a screen name of your choice. The type of information you can share in this way includes your photo, the names of places you've stayed in, your lists, your reviews and other information about voyages and destinations.

Marketing Activities: We also use your information for marketing activities, as permitted by law. For example:

When you make a booking with us or set up a user account, we may use your contact information to send you news about similar travel-related products and services.

You can opt out, or unsubscribe, from marketing communications at any time using the "Unsubscribe" link in each newsletter, or you can administer your subscriptions through your account (if you've created one).
