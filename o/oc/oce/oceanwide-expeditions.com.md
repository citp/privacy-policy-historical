So when you click on one of the buttons and register with your social media account, information is shared with your social media provider, and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network.

In addition to implementing these buttons, we use social media by maintaining accounts and offering apps on several social media sites. These social media services may allow you to share information with us. When you register with a social media app, you'll be told which information will be shared with oceanwide-expeditions.com. The information you choose to share with us may include the basic information that’s available in your social media profile, email address, status updates and your list of friends. This information is necessary to create a unique user experience either in the app itself or on our websites. It facilitates things like personalizing our website to suit your needs, connecting you with your friends on travel destinations, and analyzing and enhancing our travel-related services.

We may also enable you to sign in to the website with your social media accounts. Your social media provider will be able to tell you more about how they use and process your data in such cases.
