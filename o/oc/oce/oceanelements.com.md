1.    In order to enable us to provide our holidays, then for services such as booking of accommodation, flights, ski or resort extras, insurance etc., we may disclose your information to our third party providers (UK and overseas). To enable you to travel overseas, it may also be mandatory (as requested govt authorities) to disclose your information for immigration, security or any other reasons which they deem appropriate. Even if not mandatory, we might need to use your information to assist where appropriate, and we will do this at our discretion.

2.    We may have to disclose your information to our “group companies” (including overseas companies) in order to ensure efficient and accurate processing of your booking.
