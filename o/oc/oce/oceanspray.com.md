_Children’s Privacy Policy for Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Competitions_

From time to time, however, we may request limited personally-identifiable information in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes. Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), Ocean Spray will never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without first obtaining verifiable consent from the child's parent or legal guardian. Our practices with respect to collection of personally-identifiable information from children under the age of 13 are described below. We do not condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to engage in the activity. In addition, a parent may at any time review and edit any personally-identifiable information collected about their child under the age of 13, have this information deleted, and prohibit further collection or use of the child's information (although this may require the child to forfeit any prize won in a sweepstakes or contest).

From time to time, we reserve the right to make updates to this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information by, for example, placing a notice on this Website. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this Privacy Policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it. Your continued use of the Website following any changes to this Privacy Policy will be deemed to constitute your acceptance of such change.
