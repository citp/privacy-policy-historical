We understand that our customers expect us to keep their purchases confidential, and so we have made a deliberate choice to protect personal information.

We only collect information that is necessary for each transaction. We won’t use or share it for any other purposes, and it will never be sold to third parties.

When we ship orders, we deliver in discreet, plain packaging, so the nature of your purchase is not revealed.
