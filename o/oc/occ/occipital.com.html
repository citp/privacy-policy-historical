In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal data was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal data that were disclosed.  California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@occipital.com.

        <p>You may opt-out of sharing location from your device by disabling location features entirely for the Software from your device settings (the exact steps to do so will vary based on your device).</p>

        <p>You may choose not to create an account thus avoid giving us your name and email address, although many features may require the creation of an account.
