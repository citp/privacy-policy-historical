# Privacy Policy - Octopart

Octopart values your privacy. This policy describes Octopart’s practices regarding personally identifiable information and data (“Personal Information”). This policy applies to our website, our blog, our tools, our API, email communications, and social media accounts (collectively, the “Properties”). When you use the Properties, you agree to the terms in this policy.

## The types of Personal Information we collect

When you use the Properties, we may collect information from you. Some of it may be personal information. This information can include search history, IP address, your device, location, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you choose to create an Octopart account, we will collect your email address, password, and other preference information you provide us. If you use our BOM tool, we will collect your personal information to create and maintain your BOMs. This can include the personal information that may be included in the confirmation emails you forward to us. If you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.

## How we collect your Personal Information

We collect your personal information directly from you. For example, when you provide us your personal information when you search on Octopart or create an Octopart account. We also collect your personal information passively. For example, we use tracking tools like cookies and beacons (read more about these tools in Cookies and Other Tracking Tools section in this Privacy Policy).

## Why we use your Personal Information

  * To provide our products and services to you.
  * To communicate with you about your use of our products and services, to respond to your inquiries, and for other customer service purposes.
  * To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to offer location customization, and personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the Properties.
  * For marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may use your information, such as your email address, to send you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or information we think may interest you. We also may use the information that we learn about you to assist us in advertising our products and services on third party websites.
  * To better understand how users access and use our Properties, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Properties and respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.



## How we share your Personal Information

We may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for our legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers who perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose your information.

We may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to RSVP for an event, we may share your information with the event organizers.

If Octopart itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, owners would have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein.

If you use our BOM tool, you can share your BOMs with anyone you choose. Your BOMs may contain enough details (for example, the specific parts included in your prototype, the quantities you intend to order) to allow the recipient to understand your production plans, replicate your prototype, etc. You should only share your BOM with people you trust. If you choose to display you BOM on publicly-viewable web pages, that information may be collected and used by others. We will not share your BOMs with any individual or organization, or publicly, without your prior written consent.

We may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims.

We may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others.

## How we store and protect your Personal Information

We store your Personal Information on cloud servers. Our cloud service provider may redistribute secure data amongst physical locations in order to process it, but they are subject to contractual restrictions which limit their use of any content we provide to providing our cloud services and do not, as a matter of course, send your information to any third parties.

We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including, where appropriate, password protection, encryption, SSL, firewalls, and internal restrictions on who may access data to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Tools

We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Properties. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Properties, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Properties. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

  * Session Cookies 

Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.

  * Persistent cookies 

Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.




### Third party Cookies

We may also engage third parties to track and analyze data related to the Properties. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Properties, to analyze usage of the Properties, and to serve relevant ads. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected. This Policy does not cover such third parties' use of the data.

### Disabling Cookies

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Properties who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Properties, but some features may not function.

### Third Party Analytics

We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Properties. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our products and services. We use these tools to help us improve our products and services, performance and user experiences. We do not share your Personal Information with these third parties.

## Other Websites

If you click through to third party websites or other platforms, Octopart’s privacy policy does not apply.

## Children

Octopart does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. By using our services and the Properties after we post these changes, you indicate you accept them.

## Accessing and modifying your Personal Information

You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your Personal Information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site for a period of time. You may also contact us with any questions about or requests to modify your Personal Information at [contact@octopart.com](mailto:contact@octopart.com).
