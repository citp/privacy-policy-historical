# Privacy policy | Octopus Deploy

This page is specifically about general privacy concerns, and how we manage your personal data. If you're a citizen of the EU, or are interested in where we fit in with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), have a read of **[our GDPR information](https://web.archive.org/gdpr)**. 

## Introduction

Welcome to Octopus Deploy! We offer a deployment automation tool that you can download, and install on your own servers, and that we may also provide in a hosted/Software-as-a-Service capacity. As you use this website or our any of our products, we may collect information about you. This privacy policy will help you to understand what information Octopus Deploy collects, how we use it, and some choices that you have. 

This policy covers information that we ( **Octopus Deploy Pty. Ltd.** and related entities) collect from your use of "Octopus Deploy Services". " **Octopus Deploy Services** " includes our: 

  * Websites
  * SaaS Products
  * Downloadable Products



## Information we collect and receive

**1\. Information that you give to us directly**

Our Websites, SaaS products and Downloadable Products may ask for information about you and the company you work for. This is collected as you register for an account, purchase licenses, register for product trials, or otherwise use or interact with our website. Examples of the information we collect includes: 

  * Contact information, such as your name, email, mailing address and phone number
  * Billing information, such as credit card details and billing addresses
  * Profile information, such as a username, profile photo and job title
  * Preferences, such as notification and email marketing preferences



This information is provided by you when you enter it into our website or use one of our products, and so you naturally consent to us collecting it. 

In some cases information about you may be entered by someone else, typically a billing or system administrator at your company - for example when they set up an account for you, or include you as a contact on an invoice. If you are providing information about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their personal information as described in this policy. 

When you use our Downloadable Products, the information that we collect is limited to: 

  * Contact information you provide when registering for a product trial
  * Statistical summaries of how you use our Downloadable Products, such as the number of projects or deployments
  * Server-specific information such as operating system versions, CPU usage, memory and disk size information

Examples of content you might provide includes comments on blog posts, support requests and emails that you send us, or data that you enter in the the course of using the functionality in our Websites or SaaS Products (but not Downloadable Products). This content includes any personal information, or sensitive information, that you choose to include. 

**2\. Information that we collect indirectly**

We also gather information about you indirectly, through observing how you use our Websites or SaaS Products. This includes: 

  * **Web server logs** , which capture information including your IP address, browser and operating system version, and URL's requested. This information is typically not personally identifying, though it may incidentally capture personally identifiable information if that information is included as part of the request (for example, in a URL query string).
  * **Analytics data** which is captured either by us, or by third parties analytics partners.



As at the time this policy came into effect, we use the following third party analytics partners: 

  * [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/).
