# Privacy Policy and Use of OCRA Website

### Introduction

  
The Members of OCRA Worldwide respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. 

We have structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit OCRA Worldwide on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. 

### Application of this Privacy Policy

  
OCRA Worldwide provides this Privacy Policy to describe our privacy practices relating to persons who are not our clients and the choices such persons can make about the way personal information is collected and how that information is used. This Privacy Policy applies to: 

  * Visitors to our websites, who interact with our websites in any way (including by the completion of online forms, sending us email or subscription to our email newsletter).
  * Persons who communicate with OCRA Worldwide by any other method (such as by telephone, facsimile or letter)

This Privacy Policy ceases to apply when persons contract with us and become our clients as our terms relating to client privacy and confidentiality are contained in our [Terms of Business](https://web.archive.org/about_ocra/terms.asp?LeftFrameName=3&UseReferer=1&referer=overview). Clients should note that the privacy and confidentiality provisions in our Terms of Business differ from this Privacy Policy. 

### Sites Covered by this Privacy Policy

  
This Privacy Policy applies to www.ocra.com. 

### Links to Non-OCRA Worldwide Websites

  
The OCRA Worldwide Websites may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave our websites. OCRA Worldwide does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from OCRA Worldwide's. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. OCRA Worldwide's Privacy Policy does not cover the personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. 

### Browsing OCRA Worldwide Websites

  
If you visit any OCRA Worldwide Website and do not complete any online forms or communicate with us in any other way, you should note that: 

> Members of OCRA Worldwide will not collect or retain any personal data from web visitors who view pages on our websites and do not complete online forms or communicate with us in any other way.

> Our servers will seek to place a cookie on your computer so that we may track statistics relating to new and repeat visitors and other information which is not personally identifiable. A cookie is a piece of data placed on a user's hard drive containing information that enables unique web visitors to be identified for the purposes of analysing user interaction with a website. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information. We do not seek to associate cookies with the completion of online forms.

> We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer our websites, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 
> 
> An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and utilise online forms and processes. 

### How we treat Personal Information

  
If you complete an online form or communicate with us by any means, Members of OCRA Worldwide will collect personal data from you, will communicate with you and use this personal data to facilitate supplying services and products. This may mean that personal data is passed to firms and organisations that are not Members of OCRA Worldwide for purposes relating to supplying our services such as shipping services and other third-party service providers acting upon our request to fulfil your requests. The personal data we collect includes information relating to contact information (such as name, address and telephone), identity information (such as passport number, nationality and place of birth) and such other information as may be required to facilitate supplying services and products. 

OCRA Worldwide may utilise personal data to provide reference notes, guidelines, advice and for marketing such other services and products and providing such other information as Members of OCRA Worldwide may from time to time make available. If you do not wish to receive this type of information, you should advise us by contacting [privacy@ocra.com](mailto:privacy@ocra.com?bcc=control@ocra.com)

Our email newsletter is available to users who subscribe to it and instructions relating to terminating its despatch are contained in every email newsletter that is sent out. 

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for your name and email address, as well as your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our website. We do not store this information. The information is for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

### Distribution of Personal Information outside the EEA
