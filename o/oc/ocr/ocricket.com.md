**PRIVACY POLICY**

 **INTRODUCTION.** Cricket Network Pvt. Ltd. ( “oCricket”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the oCricket website (“the Site”). We created this Website Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at help@ocricket.com.

 **Information Collection Practices**  
 **  
Types of Information Collected**

(a) Traffic Data Collected. We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site:  
(1) IP addresses;  
(2) domain servers;  
(3) types of computers accessing the Site; and  
(4) types of web browsers used to access the Site (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site. We also use “cookies” to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site. The information stored in Traffic Data cookies is not linked to any Personal Information. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by oCricket.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party. 

(b) Personal Information Collected. In order for you to access certain premium, services and to purchase products that we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes the following categories of information:  
(1) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address);  
(2) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); and  
(3) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, and age). If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. 

**Uses of Information Collected**

(a) oCricket USE OF INFORMATION. We use Contact Data to send you information about oCricket, our products or services, promotional material from some of our partners, or to contact you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving such communication at any time by changing your Notification Preferences on your My Account/Notifications page. We use your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your experience on the Site, displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences. When you log in to your account at oCricket.com, we link the information we store in your log in session cookie to Personal Information. Your Contact Data (e-mail address) is required for the proper functioning of certain content (e.g., our cricket games). We DO NOT store any personally identifiable data in our cookies. 

(b) Sharing of Personal Information. We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We share Demographic Data with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. We may share Contact Data and Financial Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfilment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to oCricket. We do not share, sell, rent or trade Personal Information with third parties for their promotional purposes. 

You will be given a choice to opt out of sharing your Personal Information with our business partners at the point of collection, but please understand that this will likely limit or prevent you from using the features and services we offer on the Site. In addition, we maintain a procedure for you to review and request changes to your Personal Information; this procedure is described below. 

(c) User Choice/Opt-out Regarding Collection, Use, and Distribution of Personal Information. You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site; however you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Site that require your Personal Information (e.g, user registration). If you are a registered user and do not wish to receive information and/or promotional material from us, you can opt-out from this by following the instructions included in each e-mail or communication, or via your My Account/Preferences page. You may e-mail us at help@ocricket.com for further assistance. 

(d) E-mail/Invite A Friend. If you choose to use our notification service to tell a friend about our Site, or to alert them to specific content, we will ask you for your friend’s e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the Site. oCricket does not retain the e-mail address, it is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.

 **CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.** Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to:  
(a) comply with a court order or other legal process;  
(b) protect our rights or property; or  
(c) enforce our Terms of Service.

The security of your personal information is important to us. oCricket uses industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption to protect your information. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number and/or passport number) at our online store, we encrypt that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. oCricket uses thawte SSL Certificates to offer secure communications by encrypting data to and from the site. Click HERE for more information on the thawte SSL certification. 

oCricket servers are housed in a secure data center behind a dedicated firewall, and access to the data contained on the servers is restricted with encryption and passwords. 

We follow accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is perfectly secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee, and you cannot expect, its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us via the “Contact Us” link at the bottom of each page, or send an e-mail to us at help@ocricket.com.
