Our website offers the possibility to share content on social media channels, e.g. Facebook.

### Advertising cookies

In addition, we may use advertising cookies. These advertise Cambridge Assessment across the internet by displaying to you relevant Cambridge Assessment advertising based on what you have viewed. This is done by placing a cookie on your device. Cookies allow us to display advertising that may be relevant to you. For information about other cookies and how to disable them please refer to the section on Cookies below.

### Transferring personal data

The United Kingdom and countries inside the European Economic Area have specific laws which protect the way personal data is used. We may transfer personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area where personal data is not protected in the same way (usually to other businesses who provide services on our behalf). In such cases we will make sure that suitable safeguards are in place to protect the personal data. What that means is that whoever we transfer data to will have to agree to protect the personal data in an appropriate way. You can request further information about this by emailing [data.protection@cambridgeassessment.org.uk](mailto:and%20stores%20the%20personal%20data%20collected%20via%20our%20website,%20marketing%20or%20market%20research.%20It%20is%20important%20to%20us%20that%20we%20protect%20your%20privacy%20and%20your%20personal%20data.%20If%20you%20have%20any%20questions%20about%20such%20matters%20you%20can%20contact%20us%20at%20data.protection@cambridgeassessment.org.uk.).

### Retention

It is our policy to retain your personal data for the length of time required for the specific purpose or purposes for which it was collected, which are set out in this Privacy Policy. We may keep data which has been anonymised for longer than this period to allow us to carry out analysis of our products and services.
