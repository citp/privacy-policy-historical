**OCLC Privacy policy**

## End-User Privacy Policy

OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc., is committed to protecting end-user privacy online. Except as provided in this policy, we will not disclose personally identifiable information about an end-user to any third party without the end-user's consent or unless required by law. If a user submitting their E-mail address, postal address or telephone number is suspected of being younger than 13 years of age, OCLC will delete this information from its records in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S. Code, 6501 et seq)

  1. **Information We Collect**
    1. IP Address 

The OCLC web site logs IP addresses for system administration purposes. Your IP address can help us diagnose problems with our server and track an end-user's session to give us an idea of which parts of our site end-users are visiting.

    2. Cookies 

OCLC uses a feature of your browser called a cookie to store your member ID and state information about where you are in the site. OCLC uses cookies to keep track of where you are in the site what pages you visit, and past activity at a site. OCLC does not store any of your personal information in cookies. A cookie is simply a small data file that the web site writes to your hard drive. A cookie can't read any other data off your hard drive, pass on a virus, or read cookie files created by other sites. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. The OCLC web site will not operate properly without cookies enabled.

    3. Registration 

A significant amount of the site is available without registration, but in order to take advantage of some features of the site, you must register and create a member account. The OCLC online registration form requires you to provide your full name, email address, a User Name, and a password.

    4. Use of E-Mail Addresses and other information 

At your request, OCLC will use an e-mail address or other information that you supply to send a one-time e-mail inviting a friend to visit the site.

    5. Links 

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that OCLC is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our end-users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.

    6. Usage and Circulation Records 

As you interact with OCLC, your usage patterns are logged. This tells us if you searched to find information and what searches you used. We also log whether your searches were successful and what subject areas you visited. Unless you have violated the Terms of Use or another applicable Agreement or we are required to do so by law; we only view, analyze, and disclose usage records in aggregated form.

  2. **Our Use of Your Information**

The majority of the information we collect is analyzed so that we can improve your OCLC experience. This information is held in strictest confidence and is not shared outside of OCLC except as specifically described in this statement. If necessary, we will use your information to contact you.

    1. Information Distribution 

OCLC will never willfully disclose personally identifiable information to a third party unless: 

      * you have violated the Terms of Use or another applicable Agreement
      * we are required to do so by law,
      * you give us your permission, or
    2. Opt-Out Features 

It is important to OCLC that you control how we use the information you provide. 

      * To tell us you don't want to receive communication from OCLC, such as email newsletters announcing new features, contests, or new content, opt out at registration or send an email to [privacy@oclc.org](mailto:privacy@oclc.org)
      * You can decline to provide personal information to us. Please note that in some cases this will limit your interaction with OCLC.
    3. Security 

Your password is a component of our security system. As such, it is your responsibility to protect it. Do not share your password with any third parties. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should change it immediately.

    4. Third Party Collectors of Information 

OCLC's Privacy Statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Any information you disclose to a third party, such as other end-users, is subject to that party's Privacy Statement. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

    5. Notification of Changes 

If we decide to change our privacy policy we will give notice of the change so our end-users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. This notice may be given by any means, including, without limitation, by posting the changes on our web site; or by notifying end-users via email or conventional mail; or by some other reasonable means. Users always have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from OCLC by editing their account or sending an email to [privacy@oclc.org](mailto:privacy@oclc.org).
