#### 3\. Who can get information about me?

Our Services help you engage with the virtual reality ecosystem and others that interact with it. To provide and support our Services, information we have about you may be shared in certain circumstances. Here is who can see information about you when you and others use our Services. 

  * _**Public Information**_. Certain information you post to your Oculus profile, such as your Oculus ID, your system-generated user ID, and avatar, will be public and visible to people on and off our Services. Your Oculus ID is a unique identifier you choose to identify yourself on our Services. Your system-generated internal-ID is an opaque string of characters generated by the Oculus system that identifies your Oculus profile. 

Information you post to public areas of our Services, such as a forum, blog, or other community tool, will also be visible to people on and off our Services. If you post information to these interactive features, it will be publicly available. Certain information associated with your public posts, such as the time of your post, may also be published and publicly available. 

  * _**Apps, Developers, and Other Online Content Providers that You Access on our Services**_. You can use third-party content, games, apps, and other experiences through our Services. When you use these third-party services, the third parties may be able to access information about you. For example, these third parties may be able to access: 

    * Information in your Oculus profile. 

    * Information about your interaction with the third-party service, such as how long you have interacted with content or how far you have progressed in a game. 

    * Any other information you choose to share with the third party. 

Please note that any information shared with these (or other) third parties will be subject to those third parties' own privacy policies. 

  * _**Sharing Within Related Companies**_. We may share information within the family of related companies that are legally part of the same group of companies that Oculus is part of, or that become part of that group, such as Facebook. For a list of our related companies, please see <https://www.oculus.com/related-companies/>. 

  * _**Service providers**_. We may share the information we collect with vendors, service providers, researchers and other partners, who work at our direction to support the Services (such as hosting our Services, fulfilling orders, facilitating payments, analyzing the way people use our Services, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, or sending electronic communications for us). 

  * _**Other parties in connection with certain business transactions**_. In the event that the ownership of Oculus (or any portion of our assets) changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, or in the event of a bankruptcy, information from or about you or your device may be transferred to another company. 

  * _**Consent**_. We may share information about you for any other purpose for which you give us your consent. 




We may also share de-identified or aggregate data with others for any purpose. De-identified data means information where we have removed your name or contact information. Aggregate data is data that has been combined with other data so that it doesn't identify any specific person. 

#### 4\. Responding to legal requests and preventing harm. 

We may access, preserve and share information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud or other illegal activity; to protect Oculus, our Services, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you, including financial transaction data related to purchases made on or through our Services, may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also may retain information from accounts disabled for violations of our terms for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of our terms. 

#### 5\. Third Parties that Provide Content, Marketing, or Functionality on Our Services

Some of the content, marketing, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. For example, we work with companies that help us understand how people use our Services. 

Other companies may collect information on or through our Services to market to you on or off of our Services. These and other third parties may collect information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, device IDs, local storage, pixels and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services. 

#### 6\. Security

Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect the information we maintain, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to our Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of information. 

#### 7\. International Users

Oculus is based in the United States, and, regardless of where you use our Services or otherwise provide information to us, the information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the U.S. or other countries. Note that the laws, regulations and standards of the country in which this information is stored may be different from your own country. By using our Services, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S. and other countries.
