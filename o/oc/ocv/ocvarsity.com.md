# OCRegister.com privacy

**Privacy Policy**  
Last updated: June 2003

We respect your privacy and appreciate the confidence you have placed in OCRegister.com as your primary source of information about Orange County. We are committed to protecting your privacy and preserving your trust. This Privacy Policy explains how personal information may be collected and used at this site.

**Information Collection and Use**

OCRegister.com collects information from our users at several different points on our website. For example, we may collect personally identifiable information from you such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address when you register, subscribe to one of our services, enter contests offered by our site, and at other times. In addition, we automatically collect non-personal information such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, and site usage information, in order to evaluate and improve the performance of our site.

We collect and use information for the specific purposes for which you provide it, such as processing an online registration at your request. We also collect and use information:

• to enhance your experience at our site;   
• to perform site administration and technical support;  
• to notify you about our new and existing content, events, products or services (e.g., we may invite you to subscribe to our complimentary newsletter/late breaking news/coupons and promotions e-mail program);   
• to enable you to enter contests and sweepstakes;   
• to create aggregate information about demographics and usage patterns;   
• to invite our promotional partners and advertisers – with your explicit permission – to call to your attention special offers, products and services that may be of interest to you.

We may also use third party providers to help us contact you or to support our site and services, and for these limited purposes, we may share your personally identifiable information with our providers. By registering for and/or using our site, you consent to our sharing of your personal information with our third party providers for these limited purposes.

We may disclose personal information when required by law to do so, or at the request of a law enforcement agency. We may also disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to avoid violation of, or interference with, the terms of use of our site or services, or with our proprietary rights, or the rights of third parties.

We will not sell, share, or rent this personal information to other third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose personally identifiable information to third parties without your explicit permission, except as disclosed in this policy. Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their personal information used for promotional purposes at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive such promotional materials may unsubscribe from receiving future e-mail communications from OCRegister.com, by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the e-mail communication.

We may use aggregate information to measure general site usage patterns and characteristics of our user base, and we may include such aggregate information about our audience in reports to our partners or vendors. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our e-mail newsletter registrants live in South County) without your permission in order to describe our audience to existing and prospective advertisers or other third parties. However, this aggregate information does not reference names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, or other personally identifiable information, and it is not traceable to a specific recipient or e-mail address.

**Registration**

The general registration area can be found on our home page at www.OCRegister.com. To use or access certain features of the site, you may have to register or otherwise provide personal information. The decision to provide this information is purely optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content or features or participate in various areas of the site.

**Security**

Personal information collected by OCRegister.com is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. We are dedicated to maintaining the security of such information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. We will notify you immediately if any breach of our security system affects you by sending an e-mail notice to you within 5 days of our discovery of any such breach 

**Cookies**

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer or use other technology to improve your navigation of our site. The cookie itself does not contain your personal information, although it will enable us to relate your use of the site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to us. You may be able to set your browser to reject cookies, but then you may be unable to access certain areas of the site or may not be able to customize the siteÕs features. Some of our business affiliates, partners, and advertisers independently may use cookies, to tell when you have contacted their web site. Because we do not control the privacy policies of our business affiliates, partners, advertisers or any other sites to which we may provide links, you should check the privacy policy of the site that you are visiting if you have any concerns about that site's use of cookies or other data gathering devices.

**Other Links**

You may be able to access content and other services through links located on our site, including the websites of business affiliates, partners, advertisers or other sites. This policy does not apply to such content or services, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any site that may be linked to our site. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such site.

**Discussion Board And Forums**

Our Discussion Board can be a useful way for you to express yourself to other online users. When you post messages or otherwise use the Discussion Board, the information that you provide (including personally identifiable information) may be publicized to, collected by, and used by third parties. We are not responsible for the content of messages posted by users or disclosures of personal information through the Discussion Board, any online chat area, or any other public forum available through the site.

By using our site or participating in any of the public areas on our site, you specifically acknowledge and agree that: (a) OCRegister.com will not be responsible for any offensive, defamatory, slanderous, libelous, infringing, or illegal conduct or content ("Inappropriate Materials") of any user of the site; (b) OCRegister.com may monitor the site's public areas, in our sole discretion, for Inappropriate Materials; (c) OCRegister.com may pull Inappropriate Materials off the site, in its sole discretion; and (d) you will indemnify OCRegister.com and its affiliates, employees, representatives, partners, assigns, successors, advertisers, and service providers, against actions, suits, claims, demands, liability, damages and/or costs that arises from, or relates to, any Inappropriate Material that you post or make public on or through the site.

**Children's Privacy Statement**

This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen and provides important information on your rights under federal law with respect to such information.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records. Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our site.
