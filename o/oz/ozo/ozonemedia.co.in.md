# Ozone Media | Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy

#### Privacy Policy

#### 

Ozone Media Pvt Ltd (“Ozone Media”) is the Definitive South Asian Audience Platform enabling advertisers and marketers across the region to communicate with their audiences and helping publishers to grow their revenues with better optimization and campaign planning. We have developed the application Adadyn, which helps advertisers create personalized ads for every single customer dynamically at run time. With a unique rule based engine, it allows for a much more deeper and meaningful engagement with the customers. We are headquartered in India, with an office in Bangalore and an international office in New Jersey, USA. We provide this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) so that we may inform you about how our ad optimization technology, including our Ad Network Platform for online advertisers, including Real-Time Bidding Service and Adadyn (collectively, the “Service”) gathers and processes information on behalf of (i) advertisers, agencies and ad networks, and any other media-buying clients (collectively “Demand Partners”); and (ii) website owners, mobile application owners, ad networks, ad exchanges, sell-side platforms and any other suppliers of advertising inventory for sale (collectively “Supply Partners”); wherein Demand Partners and Supply Partners in (i) and (ii) above together are “Clients”. This policy also outlines our privacy practices on our corporate Website (“Website”), [www.ozonemedia.com.]()

Ozone Media recognizes and values your privacy and we are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information. In order to better protect you, we have adopted a strong privacy policy that allows you to monitor the information you have provided us. We will seek your consent before collecting any information about you, and you will always be aware of exactly what we are going to use the information for. If at any time you wish to withdraw your personal information, all you are required to do is to contact us at [privacy@ozonemedia.com](mailto:privacy@ozonemedia.com) and tell us exactly what information you would like removed.

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, so please visit ozonemedia.com regularly to review our privacy statement. 

##### USAGE

We use cookies and web beacons for select purposes. We use them in order to track when we deliver an advertising impression so that we can correctly credit it to a Demand Partner and invoice that Demand Partner. We also drop a cookie for counting frequency of exposure to a particular ad to meet a Demand Partner’s campaign objective around frequency capping. As a buyer of RTB inventory available for sale on sell-side platforms and exchanges (Supply Partner), we do map anonymized user identification number (“UID”) against Supply Partner’s anonymized UID so as to gain handle to the underlying impression and be able to serve appropriate ad on that impression.
