**INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU**

The information Ozy gathers falls into two categories: 1) personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for any Services, enter a contest, or provide your e-mail address and 2) non-personal information collected through technology, including tracking information collected when you utilize the Services.

**Registration Information.** Registration for Ozy Services may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique e-mail address and demographic information (e.g., zip code, age, gender) to register.

**Billing and Credit Card Information.** To enable payment on the Ozy services, we may collect and store name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction, such as fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.

**User Generated Content.** We offer you opportunities to post content and engage in public activities through the Services. “Public activities” are any actions you take through the Services that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by Ozy for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all Media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other Service users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
