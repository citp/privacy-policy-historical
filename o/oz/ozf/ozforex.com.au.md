  3. [In some circumstances, OzForex may also disclose your personal information to intermediary banks in order to process certain transactions on your behalf, for example, by disclosing your name and address.]

  5. OzForex will make reasonable efforts to inform you if we have collected personal information about you from someone else.

  7. Subject to any legislative requirements, OzForex will destroy, erase, or make anonymous your personal information when it is no longer required to fulfil the purpose for which it has been collected. 
  8. If you refuse or fail to provide any requested information, OzForex may not be able to process any transaction/s for you. 



_Accuracy_

  1. OzForex has in place a range of security safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification, regardless of the format in which it is held. 
  2. The methods of protection may depend on the sensitivity of the information and the format in which it is contained. Security measures employed by OzForex include: 
    1. technological measures including SSL 128 bit encryption for all data transfers over the Internet; 
    2. physical measures such as locked filing cabinets and restricted access to offices; and 
    3. strategic measures such as security clearances and limiting access to a "need-to-know" basis. 
  3. OzForex ensures that its staff are aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information.

    2. legal, investigative, security, or commercial proprietary reasons; or 
    3. the information is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.

    3. reveal personal information about another individual; or 
    4. contravene another law that prohibits the disclosure.
