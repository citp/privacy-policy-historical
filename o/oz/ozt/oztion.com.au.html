						<p>OZtion has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 
						This document discloses our information gathering and usage practices. 
						For additional information about OZtion, please review our <a href="http://www.oztion.com.au/public/agreement.htm">User Agreement</a>. </p>

						identify and troubleshoot problems. </p>
						<p>You agree that OZtion will send you emails throughout the auction process and other emails you elect to receive, in addition to 
						customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc).  Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. 
						In addition, OZtion will send newsletters and promotional emails to members periodically. Newsletters and promotional emails will contain 
						clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list. OZtion will remove any member 
						from OZtion's newsletter and promotions mailing list upon the member's request.</p>
						
						<p><strong>3. Disclosure of your information </strong></p>
						<p>OZtion does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. However, the following describes some of the ways your personal 
						information may be disclosed, and by agreeing to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy you agree that your personal information may be 
						disclosed in the following ways.</p>
						<p>The OZtion Community and Internet Users <br>
						You are identified on OZtion by your User ID, other people can see items you are bidding on, have won or purchased in the past, have sold 
						in the past, items you are currently selling, your ratings and comments received from other users and ratings and comments you have left 
						to other users, your posts in the forums and so on. Your email address and contact information is available to your trading partners 
						(members you have completed a transaction with). Note:  members you have completed a transaction with can 
						<a href="http://www.oztion.com.au/secure/User/exchange/exdetails.aspx">request to exchange contact details</a> with you 
						(name, address and phone numbers).</p>
						<p>Legal Requests<br>
						OZtion will disclose any  information about you only when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our User 
						Agreement; or protect intellectual property and other rights, property, or safety of OZtion, our users, or others. 
						OZtion cooperates with law enforcement and government officials and  other third parties and we can (and you authorise us to) disclose any 
						information about you as we, in our sole discretion, believe appropriate to assist with investigations into fraud, intellectual property 
						infringements, privacy or any other  illegal activity or activity that may expose OZtion to legal liability. </p>
						<p>Although OZtion adheres to industry standard practices to ensure your personal information is protected, due to technical limitations, 
						we cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information will remain private as third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
						private communications and transmissions. </p>
						
						<p><strong>4. Emailing tools </strong></p>
						<p>OZtion provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to OZtion or to send references to a specific listing to a friend. 
						You may not use the "Email to a friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise 
						send content that would violate our User Agreement or Privacy Policy. We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages 
						or the email addresses.</p>
						
						<p><strong>5. Updating your personal information </strong></p>
						<p>OZtion provides you with ways in which you can update your personal information, including changing your email address, password, 
						address and phone number, etc. You must ensure your personal information is kept up to date and is accurate. OZtion will store your 
						previous personal information to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, assist with any investigations and enforce our User Agreement and 
						legal requirements. </p>
						<p>Upon your request we will deactivate your account, however your personal information is not removed from our databases due to technical 
						constraints. Therefore you should not expect that your personal information is removed. To close your account, please go to: 
						http://www.oztion.com.au/secure/User/cancelmembership.aspx</p>
						
						<p><strong>6. Control of your password </strong></p>
						<p>You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID, email address and password, including fees charged. 
						Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your OZtion password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID, 
						email address and password or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all 
						actions taken with this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.</p>
						
						<p><strong>7. Credit card security</strong></p>
						<p>We protect your credit card information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information 
						you input. Your credit card details are not stored on OZtion servers. Credit card payments are processed by a  third party Australian payment 
						gateway company. Credit card information for customers on 'Auto-Bill' are stored by the payment gateway.</p>
						
						<p><strong>8. Cookies </strong></p>
						<p>Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. 
						We use cookies to improve the user's experience. We also use them to deliver information and  content specific to your interests. 
						Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites.</p>
						<p>OZtion mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once you leave OZtion. However, OZtion also uses 
						persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information 
						(such as how often members visit OZtion each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on OZtion and help us identify users abusing 
						the OZtion service.</p>
						
						<p><strong>9. Other information we collect </strong></p>
						<p>We use additional information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve 
						you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL 
						you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.</p>
						
						<p><strong>10. Advertising and third party links </strong></p>
						<p>Some OZtion advertisers may request information directly from users, or link to sites that do so. OZtion has no control over its 
						advertisers' privacy policies, and encourages users to review such policies prior to submitting any personal information to them.</p>
						<p>OZtion contains non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to enhance the member experience. OZtion has no control of 
						either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an endorsement of these sites except where 
						otherwise noted.</p>
						
						<p><strong>11. Updates to our information practices </strong></p>
						<p>From time to time, we make changes to this Privacy Policy, so we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information 
						on privacy practices at OZtion. Last updated: 25/03/2009 </p>
