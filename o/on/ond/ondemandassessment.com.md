* **Accessing and Correcting Your PII**

Upon request, Criteria will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your PII. To request this information please contact us at **Corporate[at]Criteriacorp.com, Subject: PII**. You may, of course, decline to submit PII through our Services, in which case Criteria may not be able to provide certain Services to you or, if you are a TestTaker, to your employer or prospective employer and their agents.

Criteria does not provide access to tests and test questions, which are Criteria's proprietary information.

If you are a Customer, you can access and change some of your PII we store through the "My Settings" page of your account with us. If you are a Customer, TestTaker or Website Visitor and you have provided your PII to us, you may submit a request to access, review, correct and/or delete your PII by contacting us at Corporate[at]Criteriacorp.com, Subject: PII Changes, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.

We cannot change a TestTaker's answers to test questions or test scores.

If you are a TestTaker, we cannot delete your test answers and test scores. If Criteria has provided your test scores and any interpretation of them to a Customer, we cannot delete that information from our or the Customer's records and we cannot control the use that the Customer makes of it.

Please note that, since we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Websites or through the Services.

We also reserve the right to retain and use your PII as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Criteria has no obligation to delete aggregate, anonymized and/or de-identified information derived from information submitted by Customers, TestTakers and/or Website Visitors. Criteria may use this information for internal purposes or to analyze trends and markets on behalf of its Customers.
