# Privacy Policy | OnDeck

  * We collect information required to verify your identity, to determine whether or not you qualify for one of our loan products, and to process your account including deducting automatic payments. We collect information that includes your bank statements, credit card statements, your average bank balance, personal and business credit history, tax ID number, social security number, bank account information and payment behavior. We may conduct a site visit to collect information. We also obtain your credit score from the three credit bureaus. Once you are an OnDeck customer, we may reach out to you for information again if you decide to renew your loan.

  * By providing us the required information as outlined above and in your application, you are granting OnDeck and our trusted business partners and service providers access to it.

We may share your basic information (Name, Company Name, Phone, Email Address and Requested Loan Amount) with one of our business partners if we are unable to provide you with a loan.
