# Business Financing Loans from On Deck Capital

### On Deck Capital is dedicated to helping the small business owner by advancing loans to businesses that do not qualify for a traditional bank loan. We do this with a proprietary system that looks at the performance of the business through cash flow and payment behavior in addition to personal and business credit history.

**Information We Collect**  
We collect information required to verify your identity, to determine whether or not you qualify for one of our loan products, and to process your account including deducting automatic payments. We collect information that includes your bank statements, credit card statements, your average bank balance, personal and business credit history, tax ID number, social security number, bank account information and payment behavior. We may conduct a site visit to collect information. We also obtain your credit score from the three credit bureaus. Once you are an On Deck Capital, Inc. customer, we may reach out to you for information again if you decide to renew your loan.
