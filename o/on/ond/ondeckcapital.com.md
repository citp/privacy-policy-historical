    * OnDeck takes the security of your information very seriously. OnDeck protects your information using bank-level data security: 128 bit-encryption and a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

If you allow OnDeck to see your banking information online rather than in paper form, it is on a read-only basis. We do not have access to change, edit, or modify bank account information in any way. OnDeck employees cannot view your banking username and passwords, and we securely store them in separate encrypted areas with our financial services providers.
