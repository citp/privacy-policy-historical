These third parties are not authorized to retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than completion of the services for which they were hired **.**

In addition, in the following circumstances we may share or transfer personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us; (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of our company; or (iv) when we believe it is appropriate to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company or other persons.
