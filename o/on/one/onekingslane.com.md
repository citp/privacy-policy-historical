Last Updated: **04/15/2013**

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by One Kings Lane and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "OKL"). This Policy applies to the information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, "the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us as described below.

We may change this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the Policy, and in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the homepages of our websites or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. ****

For example, we may collect information when you create an account, use the interactive areas and features of our Services, invite a friend to use our Services, make a purchase, communicate with us via third party social media sites, participate in a contest or promotion, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, phone number, billing and shipping addresses, credit card information, shopping preferences, demographic information and any other information you choose to provide.

**Information We Collect From Other Sources**  
We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with the information we collect through our Services. For example, if you create or log into your OKL account through a third party social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, email address, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site. ****
