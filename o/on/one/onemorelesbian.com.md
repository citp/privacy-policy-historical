# Privacy Policy | Lesbian films, movies, television, TV, web series, video | One More Lesbian | LGBT

We are committed to protecting your privacy at OneMoreLesbian. We will not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We do not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement.

## Cookies

Like many other Web sites, OneMoreLesbian uses cookies to identify members so they don’t have to re-enter a user id and password when they, for example, wish to post to a discussion. Cookies also help us improve your experience and display more prominently goods and services that might interest you. If you do not have cookies enabled, you must enter your password each time you access our site or any of its member features.

## Third parties

OneMoreLesbian may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns gathered during thousands of customer visits to our Web site each month but does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual member, unless that member has given us permission to share that information. We may also provide log files and other databases of user information to third parties for analysis, so we can get a better understanding of traffic through our site and thus improve our content offerings. OneMoreLesbian also may use third party companies to provide delivery of e-mail newsletters and other messages over e-mail. OneMoreLesbian uses a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our sites. This company may use information about your visits to our and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, we share web site usage information about visitors to our sites with this company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on our sites. Also be aware that we may buy and sell business assets and/or divisions; customer information is generally part of such a sale.

## Security

We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information you disclose both in your browsing and your purchases and to only release this information to third parties we believe share our commitment to privacy. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties.

## Obtaining your consent
