**
* COOKIES POLICY
**

We use cookies to improve your experience on our websites and to recommend content that may be of interest to you. You can find out more below about what cookies are, the cookies we use and how to switch them off.

You can indicate your acceptance to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy by clicking "**OK**" in the appropriate place on the banner that appears on the websites or continuing to use the Sites after the banner has been shown. However, please note that if you do not click “" **OK**" but continue to browse the websites, you will be deemed to have accepted our use of cookies (and what we use them for) in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**What are cookies?**

A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access a website. The text file is then sent back to our server each time your browser requests a page from the server. This enables us to operate the websites more effectively and load the websites so that it reflects your personal preferences, based on your previous browsing on the websites as well as keywords we may be able to gather from URLs of other webpages from which you accessed the websites.

**What cookies do we use?**

When you visit the websites, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:

  * **Analytical and Performance Cookies**

We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting. Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of the websites by using cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the websites, how long they stay and how visitors move around our websites when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way our websites work, for example, it helps users to find what they are looking for easily. The information generated relating to the websites may be used to create reports about the use of the websites and the analytics service provider will store this information.
  * **Advertising and Targeting Cookies**

These cookies record your visit to the websites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other websites. We will use this information to try and make our websites and other sites that you visit more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with others, such as other Kerzner companies and carefully selected third parties, for this purpose. We work with technology partners to support our websites and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services of websites and on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with. We may use cookies on our websites to help us to place relevant advertising on third party websites when you visit those sites. If you are not happy for us to do this, please see the section of this policy titled “How do I turn cookies off?” below.
  * **Functionality Cookies**

We may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made on the websites so as to provide you with a more enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.
  * **Strictly Necessary Cookies**

These are cookies that are required for the administration and operation of our websites. Some cookies that we use are necessary for our websites to function properly and to enable you to move around the websites and use its features.
  * **Third Party Cookies** Because Kerzner has a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks. We add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks. We also use Facebook to power some of the chat functionality on the websites. When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies. They can't read any cookies we set from our websites, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of the websites, and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site. For example, if you're logged in to Facebook, and want to converse via the chat widget, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our websites. Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.
