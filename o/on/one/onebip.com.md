# Privacy & Cookie Policy - Onebip

**ONEBIP WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY**

In this page, we describe to you the manner in which we manage this website, with specific regard to the processing of visitors’ personal data.

This Privacy Policy constitutes the disclosure on personal data processing, provided according to article 13 of the Regulation (UE) 2016/679 “General Data Protection Regulation” (“GDPR”), to all users which come across the website of Onebip S.R.L., a company with registered offices in Via Gustavo Fara 28 – 20124 Milan (the “Data Controller” or the “Company”). Let us stress the fact that we are committed to protecting your privacy, keeping the personal data you share with us secure. It is also important for us to clearly explain to you how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process your personal data. We keep reasonable physical, electronic and procedural security measures to protect your personal data and we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure their protection.

  1. **WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?**



This notice is provided to visitors exclusively with regard to the Company’s website, and does not cover other websites which the visitor may access via links included in the website, nor does it cover other services provided by the Data Controller through other means/websites. Please refer to the specific privacy policies of such services, in order to know how the Company processes personal data of users which subscribe to its services.

  2. **WHAT DATA WILL BE PROCESSED?**



The electronic systems and the software procedures in place which allow this website to function, acquire some personal data while running, the transmission of which is implied in the use of internet communication protocols.

This is, thus, information which is not collected in order to be associated to identified data subjects, but rather data which, by its very nature might, if elaborated and associated with data held by third parties, allow the identification of the users. This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of the computer used by the visitors to access the website, the requests made by such visitors, the timing of the requests, etc.

This data is used with the sole scope of obtaining statistical and anonymous information regarding the use of the Company’s website, and to ensure that it functions correctly; it is, thus, erased immediately after being used. Such data might also be used for the identification of liabilities in case of possible electronic crimes against this website.

The data acquired while browsing the website will not be used for marketing purposes and profiling; in case in future the Company would engage marketing or profiling activities, you will be asked an explicit consent.

  3. **PERSONAL DATA SPONTANEOUSLY SUBMITTED BY THE VISITORS**



The spontaneous, explicit and voluntary sending of e-mails to the e-mail addresses indicated in the Company’s website determines that the Company acquires the sender’s e-mail address (which is needed in order to allow the Company to reply) and all other personal data which the sender might have included in the message sent to the Data Controller. The same occurs in filling and sending the web forms present in the site. Please be advised that we will consider this as you giving us your express consent to store and process such data in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws

In case of voluntary submission of a _curriculum vitae_ through the “Join Us!” section of the website, the candidate will receive a specific privacy notice by reference to the processing of their personal data, at their first contact with the Company after the _curriculum vitae_ has been submitted.

  4. **WHO HAS ACCESS TO YOUR DATA?**



No personal data you provide us will be made available or transmitted to any third party without your express permission. Access to the data provided by you will only be granted on a “need to know basis” to authorized personnel of Onebip in particular:

  * Statistical information will be access by the IT and Marketing team
  * Commercial requests will be access by the Business Operations team
  * Submission of CV or other information concerning job posting will be access by the HR team



We adopt all necessary measures to ensure that your personal data shall remain safe, private and confidential at all times. We limit access to your personal data on “need to know basis” by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper processing of such data and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes.

  5. **DATA LOCATION**



Your information are stored in our databases located in Ireland, Italy and Austria.

  6. **COOKIE POLICY**



This policy explains how cookies are used on Onebip’s website, and, below, how you can control the cookies that may be used on this site.

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user’s identification card, which tell a web site when the user has returned. They were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items in a shopping cart) or to record the user’s browsing activity (clicking particular buttons, logging in etc.). Cookies can be “persistent” or “session” cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.

**What is a session cookie?**

A session cookie, also known as an in-memory cookie or transient cookie, exists only in temporary memory while the user navigates the website. Web browsers normally delete session cookies when the user closes the browser. Unlike other cookies, session cookies do not have an expiration date assigned to them, which is how the browser knows to treat them as session cookies.

**What is a persistent cookie?**

Instead of expiring when the web browser is closed as session cookies do, persistent cookies expire at a specific date or after a specific length of time. This means that, for the cookie’s entire lifespan (which can be as long or as short as its creators want), its information will be transmitted to the server every time the user visits the website that it belongs to, or every time the user views a resource belonging to that website from another website (such as an advertisement).

**How to change cookie settings on your browser**

Most internet browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can change the settings of your browser prevent automatic acceptance or erase them.
