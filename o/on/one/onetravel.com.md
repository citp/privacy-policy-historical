# OneTravel Privacy Policy

**INTRODUCTION**  
OneTravel.com is strongly committed to protecting your privacy.

OneTravel is committed to providing fair information practices and adopts the highest degree of privacy policy in protecting customer’s private and personal information submitted to OneTravel in connection with purchasing travel products from OneTravel.  This privacy statement covers the site OneTravel.com. 

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).

We use this information for billing purposes and to fulfill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

We do not sell, trade, share or rent your personal information to others without your prior consent. We keep your personal information private and secure in our databases and during transfer to our third party marketing partners. When you use our system, you are asked to provide your name, email address and other information. We use this information to answer your questions and process your requests for services from us and/or for products or services from our third party marketing partners.

To keep you informed about our latest services, we may notify you via email newsletter of any changes or new additions to our site. You may unsubscribe from our email newsletter by following the unsubscribe instructions in any email you receive from us.

Other sites accessible through our Website have their own privacy policies and data collection practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. OneTravel.com is not responsible for the actions of third parties.

**AGENTS**  
This Website uses cookies to personalize your experience, and to speed up the member sign in process. Cookies are information stored on your computer. Cookies are not used to track your movement or perform any function other than to enhance your use of our Website. If your browser does not support cookies, or you have not enabled cookies in your browser, many of these time-saving features will not work properly. Also, you need to have cookies enabled in your browser if you want to enter the member’s area. Some of our business partners (Traffic Analyzing Software) use cookies on our Website. We have no access to, or control over these cookies.

We use an outside shipping company to ship paper tickets, and a credit card processing company to bill you for travel products. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by OneTravel only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**SECURITY**  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this [link](http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/)]

We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can send us an email or contact us [TLC@onetravel.com](mailto:TLC@onetravel.com?Subject=Lowest%20Fare%20Promise) **[(866) 883-0908]**

**CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement page, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time. Please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.
