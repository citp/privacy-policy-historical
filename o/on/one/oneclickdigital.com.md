**Privacy Policy**

The information you provide to us through our web site will only be used for your current purchase and will not be retained by us except in our order archive which is used to recall your order if we or you have questions about it later.

We use your personal information internally to improve your shopping experiences and the services we provide. We only obtain personal information about you, if you choose to opt-in to our E-mail list. We may also combine your personal information with third party demographic information data. This helps us to improve the content of our web site and to alert you to new products, services and special offers targeted to your specific interests. Any personally identifiable information we collect will not be shared with any third party.

**Security**

When you give us your credit card number or other sensitive information, that data is encrypted and sent to our computers to be processed via a Virtual Private Network. All sensitive information is encrypted throughout the entire process, and access to this information on our servers is restricted to a small group of authorized employees.

Other security measures include making aware all employees safe security practices and daily review of security measures within our encrypted system.

There are several ways to confirm that a Web page you are viewing is secure. If the site uses SSL encryption, as we do, then you will see either a padlock (if you are using Internet Explorer) or a key (if you are using Netscape Navigator) near the bottom of your browser window. You will also note that the Internet address of the Web page, typically displayed near the top of your browser, will begin with the text "https://" rather than simply "http://" (e.g., "https://www.sitename.com/...). This extra "s" indicates the use of a secure server.

**How Information is Used**

We do not sell or rent your personal information to others. We use customer information we collect only for the purposes of filling orders, contacting purchasers to inform them of their order status, sending promotional information, for statistical purposes and to administer our systems. We may use third parties to help us fulfill orders, to help process payments, to provide customer service, to serve site content, and to administer warranties purchased. We give them access to the information needed to complete their job. Sometimes that includes a portion of your personal information. Our computer systems protect personal information using an advanced firewall server technology.
