 _Email Updates:_ Email updates provide users with the ability to receive information on new products and services, sales and special promotions. We ask for your email address, name, and zip code. You may also answer a few optional, more personal questions (such as whether or not you are expecting or if you are a grandparent) for the purpose of receiving information and promotions that are specifically designed for you. We also work with a reputable third party company, for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics, where we share with our third party company site usage information about visitors to our site who have received targeted emails from us.
