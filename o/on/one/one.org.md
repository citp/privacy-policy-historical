**PRIVACY OF OUR E-MAIL LISTS:**

ONE partner organizations maintain several e-mail lists to keep our supporters, the press and policy makers informed about news and events. Individuals who provide optional information may also receive materials in the U.S. mail and/or be contacted by telephone by authorized ONE partner organization representatives. In addition, we do not share the e-mail addresses on our lists with staff outside of ONE partner organizations and their authorized agents. We configure our list server software to refuse to divulge the e-mail addresses of our list subscribers to anyone but authorized ONE partner organization staff and agents.

**CHILDREN's PRIVACY:**

Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our site to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested. 

It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the notification, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under  
13, please do so by e-mailing us at: [one@one.org](mailto:one@one.org)
