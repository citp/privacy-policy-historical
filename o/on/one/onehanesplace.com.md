**Information Hanesbrands Collects**

Hanesbrands collects Personal Information about you on the Site only when you submit it to us, such as when subscribing to our e-mail program, purchasing products, submitting a review or question, participating in special functions of the Site, such as e-cards, wish lists or games, responding to a survey, entering a sweepstakes, or making suggestions or comments. When you request us to ship products to a shipping address of a third party, we collect that shipping address and we use it in accordance with this privacy policy.

In addition, when you access the Site our web servers may automatically recognize and collect information regarding your IP address, referring domain, your type of internet browser, operating system software, screen resolution, cookie preferences and similar technical data. None of this information is personally identifiable.

_Technology_ : When you access the Site, our web servers may automatically recognize and collect non-personally identifiable information. We use technology (e.g., small data files that may be stored on your computer that are referred to as ‘cookies,’ electronic image requests known as "web beacons" or "single-pixel gifs", and files stored on your computer called "local shared objects"). Some of this technology can recognize you as you browse or when you return to our Site. Technology may also collect the type of operating system and browser you are using and accumulate and report anonymous, statistical information on Site usage. Technology shows us how our customers use our Site and allow us to give you a more personalized experience when you use our Site. These types of technology generally do not collect, gather, monitor or share any Personal Information; they are used to compile anonymous information about Site usage. We do not use technology to detect or collect Personal Information, but we may combine the data collected by this technology with Personal Information you do give us in order to send you information that may be of interest. Some Internet browsers allow you to change the settings and stop it from automatically accepting certain technology such as cookies. Some media players, such as Flash, allow you to manage local shared objects. If you do change these settings, it may affect your ability to use certain features and functions on our Site and you may need to re-enter information when you browse or when you return to our Site. You should consult with the publisher or licensor of your browser and media players if you want to change the settings or are experiencing trouble browsing our Site.

**By using our Site, you consent to our use of tracking technologies as described above.**

_Minors_ : We recognize the particular importance of protecting the privacy of Personal Information where children are involved. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If a child under the age of 13 has provided our website with personally identifiable information, we ask that such child’s parent or guardian call (800) 671-5056 or contact us at ohp.manager@onehanesplace.com and we will delete the information about the child from our files.

**How Hanesbrands Uses the Information**

We may use your Personal Information for the following purposes:

  * to respond to your requests (including, for example, to process orders; enter a sweepstakes; post a testimonial, photograph, comment or question, or to receive product information, or catalogs or to enroll in our email program)
  * to improve the content, appearance and utility of the Site
  * to trace our visitors' use of the Site for internal research purposes
  * to invite you to participate in market research

  * to send catalogs, printed materials, offers and other announcements to postal addresses and to allow our affiliates and other reputable third party marketers to do the same

If we publish Postings that you submit to us for potential publication, we may identify you as the source of such information by first name, last initial and city of residence or as otherwise indicated on the applicable submission pages. Any information about yourself submitted in a "public" area or feature of our Site, may allow members of the general public to view such submitted information and content on the Internet, may be routed through our servers, the servers of one or more third parties on our behalf, and the Internet, **and you have no expectation of or right to privacy with regard to any such Posting**. The security of any information you disclose in public areas or features of the Site is not guaranteed; you make such Postings and disclosures at your own risk.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**

We will not rent your email address. In addition, we do not sell your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities, except in the limited circumstances described below. **Remember, we are referring to information obtained online through our Site and the use of it for email or other online purposes**. We may disclose Personal Information to affiliates for marketing and/or administrative purposes. We may rent lists of our customers’ postal mailing addresses to third parties. You can elect for us not to rent these lists to unaffiliated third parties by emailing us at ohp.manager@onehanesplace.com. Some of our contests, sweepstakes and other offerings may be co-sponsored by another company. In those situations, the information we obtain from you in connection with them may be shared with our co-sponsor. In those situations, our co-sponsors will have the right to use your information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies. We are not responsible for how our co-sponsors may use your information.

Additionally, we may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or to protect our Site, our business and assets, or other users of our Site or the public, in general. On occasion, we contract with other companies to provide certain services to us, including credit card processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, changing mailing addresses, market research and promotions management. We provide these companies only with the information (which may include Personal Information) needed to perform their services and try to ensure your Personal Information is maintained and used as set forth in this Privacy Policy Statement. These companies are prohibited from using your Personal Information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with others, but we cannot guarantee security of Personal Information and are not liable for misuse of it by others. Hanesbrands may (a) buy or sell assets, subsidiaries, or business units, or may be acquired by another company or (b) file for or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy or restructuring. In such transactions, Personal Information is usually one of the transferred business assets, and we reserve the right to transfer all Personal Information in our possession as part of any such transaction. Such transferred Personal Information shall remain subject to the promises made in this Privacy Policy Statement.

**Updating Your Personal Information; E-mail Unsubscribe Options**

If you registered on our Site, except for Personal Information needed to complete your purchase of products, if any, and in the event the Site does not have a “My Account” link to pages containing the Personal Information you wish to access, you may request that: (i) we correct or update any such Personal Information; or (ii) such Personal Information be unsubscribed from the email marketing database for the Site. To make such a request, [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20111231211238id_/http%3A//www.onehanesplace.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/contactus_10151_-1_11001) or you may send an e-mail to ohp.manager@onehanesplace.com or write to One Hanes Place Consumer Services, Hanesbrands Inc., P.O. Box 748, Rural Hall, NC 27098, or call (800) 671-5056. When contacting us, please be sure to provide us with your exact e-mail address, name, postal address, and/or telephone number(s) in order to be sure we handle your request correctly.

In addition each time we send you an e-mail marketing message, we give you the option to unsubscribe from the applicable brand’s promotional e-mail list by simply clicking the unsubscribe link. We may, however, continue to contact you via e-mail for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions you have enrolled in or registered to use, any promotions or contests you have participated in or have entered, goods and/or services you have ordered, or other transactions you have undertaken with the Site.

**Third-Party Sites**

The Site may contain advertisements, references and links to other websites and third parties. We may also use third parties (i) to host and display our branded social media fan pages (e.g., Facebook, Twitter and YouTube), or (ii) to display or serve advertising on the Site and our web-based newsletters or other communications which you may choose to receive. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those third-party sites or their privacy practices. **This Privacy Policy Statement does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third party may collect from you or that you make available via one of our branded social media pages on a third-party platform, such as Facebook. When you participate in our user community platforms at third party sites such as Facebook, the information you submit will be received and used by such third party platforms, pursuant to their privacy policies, and will also be received by us for our use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.**

**Security**

We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission or stored on our systems. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy.

**Phishing**

Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials. “Phishers” use “spoofed” e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging sensitive Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and Social Security Numbers. **WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!** If you receive such e-mail communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at ohp.manager@onehanesplace.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent e-mail from your computer.

**Updating the Privacy Policy Statement**

As we continue to develop our Site and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, we may have a need to change our current privacy policies. We therefore reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy Statement at any time. If elements of our Privacy Policy Statement change, we will revise this Privacy Policy Statement. You should check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy Statement will mean that you accept those changes. Under certain circumstances (for example, in connection with certain material changes), we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy Policy, or to request your consent for such changes, by additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page of our Web Site to sending you an e-mail.
