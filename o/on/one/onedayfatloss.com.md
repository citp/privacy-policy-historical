For example, We may contract with third parties that collect or obtain historical information about You or to verify certain information about You. We may use any information about You that We obtain from these third parties in accordance with the terms We establish with those third parties. We may combine that information with information We collect from You under this Privacy Policy. In that case, We will be required to use that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as well.

  * _What We Automatically Collect From You._ We may automatically collect the following information regarding Your interaction with, and use of, Our Website: 
    * "Cookies" are small bits of information that the Website places on Your device. Cookies remember information about Your activities on the Website to make Your visits to the Website more enjoyable and valuable to You by providing a customized experience and recognizing Your preferences when You visit the Website. If You have chosen to disable cookies on Your browser, some of the functionality of the Website may be lost. Certain services provided require that cookies be enabled in Your browser and cannot be used when You have disabled cookies in Your browser.
    * Flash Cookies (also called Local Shared Objects or “LSOs”). Flash Cookies are data files similar to Cookies, except that they can store more complex data. Flash Cookies are used to remember settings, preferences and usage, particularly for video, interactive gaming, and other similar services.
    * Web beacons or clear pixels. Web beacons are small graphic images on a web page or in an email that can be used for such things as recording the pages and advertisements that You select, or tracking the performance of email marketing campaigns.
    * Web server logs. Web server logs are records of activity created by the computer that delivers the webpages You request to Your browser. For example, a web server log may record the search term You entered or the link You clicked to bring You to the webpage. The web server log also may record information about Your browser, such as Your IP address and the Cookies set on Your browser by the server.



Furthermore, We use third-party companies to help Us serve targeted product recommendations. These companies may use data about You in order to provide recommendations for products and services that might be of interest to You.

**What do We use Your information for?**

Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is Our legitimate interest to facilitate the services on the Website. Any of the information We collect from You may be used in one of the following ways:

  * To improve customer service (Your information helps Us to more effectively respond to customer service requests and support needs).
  * To create and manage Your account and to process transactions related to and arising from the sale and purchase of goods from Our Website.
  * To help diagnose problems with Our Website, to administer Our Website, and to enhance Our Website for optimal user experience.
  * To operate, evaluate and improve Our business (including developing new products and services; enhancing, improving and analyzing Our products and services; managing Our communications; and performing accounting, auditing and other internal functions).
  * To manage Your employment application, assess Your qualifications and manage Your employment with Us.
  * To comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and Our policies, including Our Terms of Use located at <https://www.biotrust.com/pages/terms-and-conditions>
  * To send You promotional materials, newsletters and other communications, including retargeted marketing via Google or other service



Please note that the email address You provide for order processing, may be used to send You information and updates pertaining to Your order or request, in addition to receiving company news, updates, promotions, related product or service information, etc.

Although the above describes Our purpose in collecting Your information, in many situations We have more than one purpose.  For example, if You complete an online purchase We may collect Your information to perform Our contract with You, but We also collect Your information as We have a legitimate interest in maintaining Your Information after Your transaction is complete so that We can quickly and easily respond to any questions about Your order.  As a result, Our collection and processing of Your information is based in different contexts upon Your consent, Our need to perform a contract, Our obligations under law, and/or Our legitimate interest in conducting Our business.

**Your Choices**

You can make the following choices regarding Your Personal Information:

  1. **Promotional emails**. You may choose to provide Us with Your email address for the purpose of allowing Us to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to You, as well as targeted offers from third parties. You can stop receiving promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in e-mails that You receive.  If You decide not to receive promotional emails, We may still send You service related communications.
  2. **Access to Your Personal Information**. If required by law, upon request, We will grant You reasonable access to the Personal Information that We have about You. You may request access to Your Personal Information by visiting [https://www.biotrust.com/pages/request-personal-data](https://web.archive.org/pages/request-personal-data)
  3. **Changes to Your Personal Information**. We rely on You to update and correct Your Personal Information. Our Websites may allow You to modify or delete Your account profile.  Note that We may keep historical information in Our backup files as permitted by law.  If Our Website does not permit You to update or correct certain information contact Us.
  4. **Deletion of Your Personal Information**. Typically We retain Your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. You may, however, request information about how long We keep a specific type of information, or request that We delete Your Personal Information by contacting Us at the address described below or by requesting your data be deleted by visiting [https://www.biotrust.com/pages/my-personal-data](https://web.archive.org/pages/my-personal-data). In addition, We may keep Your Personal Information as needed to comply with Our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce any of Our agreements. 
  5. **Revocation Of Consent**. If You revoke Your consent for the processing of Personal Information then We may no longer be able to provide You services. In some cases, We may limit or deny Your request to revoke consent if the law permits or requires Us to do so, or if We are unable to adequately verify Your identity. You may revoke consent to processing (where such processing is based upon consent) by contacting Us.
  6. **Online Tracking.** We do not currently recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include "Do Not Track" instructions. ** **



**How do We protect Your information?**

We use reasonable security measures to help prevent Personal Information from being disclosed to individuals who are not described in this Privacy Policy. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of Your Personal Information when You place an order or access Your Personal Information. While We attempt to protect the Personal Information in Our possession, no security system is perfect and We cannot promise that Personal Information about You will remain secure in all circumstances.

In the event that We are required by law to inform You of any unauthorized access to Your Personal Information, We may choose to notify You electronically, in writing, or by telephone at Our sole discretion.

Your information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in Your country.
