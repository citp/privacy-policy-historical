## Your data protection rights

### Right to be informed

The GDPR states that you have the right to be informed about how we collect and use your personal information (“privacy information”).

### Right of access

You have a right to access any of your personal data. In some circumstances you will be able to obtain your personal information through the various self-service facilities that we provide with our products and services. However, in other circumstances such information may not be available and you can send us a special request (known as a “subject access request”) to our Data Protection Officer at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) who will assist in giving you access to the information we hold about you. We will provide this information to you within no longer than one month and free of charge, unless you make excessive requests in which case we will be entitled to charge a fee.

### Right to rectification

This is your right to have any personal data recorded about you that is inaccurate rectified or completed if it is incomplete. If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is incomplete or inaccurate then please contact our Data Protection Officer. If we are the Data Controller for your personal data then we will be able to rectify or complete it as necessary, however if we are acting as a Data Processor for your personal data then we will provide you with the contact details of the Data Controller (which may be one of our Clients).

### Right to erasure

This is your right to be forgotten and means that at your request, the personal data we hold about you can be erased. If you wish us to erase your personal data then please contact our Data Protection Officer and we will respond no longer than one month. Please note that in instances where we are processing your personal data as a Data Processor, we will promptly inform the Data Controller of your request and advise you of this when you make the request.

### Right to restrict processing

This is your right to request the restriction or suppression of your personal data (instead of erasure or rectification). It means that we can still store your data but no longer use it. There are a few circumstances in which this right can be exercised:  
(a) If you are contesting the accuracy of the personal data and in the meantime we are verifying the accuracy of the data  
(b) If you believe the personal data has been unlawfully obtained and you oppose your right to erasure  
(c) When we no longer need the data but you need it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim  
(d) You have objected to us processing your data and Onefile is considering whether our legitimate grounds override those of your own

It is therefore our policy to automatically restrict the processing whist we are considering the accuracy or the legitimate ground for processing the personal data in question.

### Right to data portability

This is your right to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you in a format that will allow to reuse your data for your own purposes across different systems. Whilst we can provide the data to you in a common format such as CSV or XML, we cannot guarantee that the service you decide to reuse your information in will accept the automatic importing of your data.

This right applies to Keychain and CPD, and the marketing subscription service.

### Right to object

This is your right to object to us processing your information. It may relate to any direct marketing you may be receiving from us or if you object to our legitimate interests. Please contact our Data Protection Officer.

### Rights related to automated decision making including profiling

We don’t make automated decision making based on your personal data.

Please note if you are using the CPD service then we reserve the right to place advertising content on your web pages that we think is appropriate to you, but this is based on the learning outcomes you have selected which is not classified as personal data.

If you have any queries about your rights, then please contact our Data Protection Officer.
