Furthermore, the Company may have access to details of your Website habits including the dates and number of times you visit the Website and the transactions you carry out through the Website.</li> <li>In order to provide the Website and Surveys we may enter into contracts with third parties for the provision of the Website, for example, our internet service provider and Website host.
