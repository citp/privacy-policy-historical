**10.**   **Additional EU Disclosures**

However, we encourage you to contact us first at support@onerpm.com, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern. 

**10.2.   Provision of personal data and failure to provide personal data**

Where we need to collect personal data by law or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with the Services). In this case, we will not be able to provide Services to you. 

**10.3.**   **Legal basis for our processing of your personal data**

Below are the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal data:

-          _Legitimate interest_ means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and the best and most secure experience. We make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).  You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us at [support@onerpm.com](mailto:support@onerpm.com).

-          _Performance of contract_ means processing your data as necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you, including all actions required to fully render the Services under any contract. 

-          _With implied or express consent_ means processing your data based on your consent, whether express or implied by your actions, such as to send you certain information, including marketing communications, to share your information with partners when you have requested we do that, or as otherwise agreed.

-          _Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation_ means processing your personal data where it is necessary for the compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject.

**10.4**.  **Change of purpose**

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider the need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.  If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at [support@onerpm.com](mailto:support@onerpm.com).  If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.  Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required by law. 

**10.5.**   **Collection of personal data from third party sources**

We also collect data about you from various third parties and public sources:

-          As discussed above,  we also obtain data through automated technologies (see section titled “Information Collected”).

**10.6.   Withdrawing your consent**

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at [support@onerpm.com](mailto:support@onerpm.com).

**10.7.**   **Use of your personal data for marketing purposes**

We strive to provide you with choices regarding personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising: 

-          _Marketing emails from us_ : We may use your Information to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.  You will receive marketing communications from us if you have signed up on the Site or used the Services and, in each case, you have opted into receiving that marketing. 

-          _Third_ - _party marketing:   _We will get your opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside of ONErpm for marketing purposes. 

To see how you can opt out of marketing communications, please see section 6 titled “Unsubscribing Choice”

**10.8.**   **Rights of EU Data Subjects**

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: 

-          _Request access to your personal data_ (commonly known as “data subject access request”).  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

-          _Request correction of the personal data_ that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. 

-          _Request erasure of your personal data_. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your data unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 

-          _Object to processing of your personal data_ where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms. 

-          _Request restriction of processing your personal data_. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 

-          _Request the transfer of your personal data to you or a third party_. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you. 

-          _Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data_.  However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

You may access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) free of charge. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. 

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 

To exercise your rights, please contact [support@onerpm.com](mailto:support@onerpm.com).

**11.   Cross Border Transfers**

The Site is maintained in the United States. If you are visiting from a region with laws governing data collection and use that differ from those in the United States, please note that you may be transferring your Information to the United States and other countries around the world. You freely and specifically give us your consent to export and use your Information within the United States and in other countries as specified in this Privacy Policy.  You understand that data stored in the United States may be subject to lawful requests by the courts or law enforcement authorities in the United States. If you are situated in the EU, whenever we transfer your personal data to processors outside of the EU, we ensure appropriate and suitable safeguards are used in such transfer.

**12.   California Policy**

If you are a California resident this section applies to you. Under California law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship: (i) a list of the categories of personally identifiable information, such as name, email address, and mailing address and the type of services provided to the customer that a business has disclosed to third party (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes and (ii) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please contact us at [support@onerpm.com](mailto:support@onerpm.com). If you do not want your personally identifying Information shared with any third party who may use such information for direct marketing purposes, then you may opt out of such disclosures by sending an email to [support@onerpm.com](mailto:support@onerpm.com).

**13.   Updates to this Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use your information that materially differs from this Privacy Policy, we will post such changes here or email you.
