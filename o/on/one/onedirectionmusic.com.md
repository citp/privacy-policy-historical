Where any of those destinations are countries that do not have data protection laws as stringent as those to which we are subject, we will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is only transferred lawfully out of the EEA, and used in accordance with this privacy policy.

We may share with others, at our discretion, certain aggregate statistical data about purchases and the use of our content, which data may include demographic data such as the age range and/or geographic location of groups of users. No personal data (such as names or email addresses) will be identifiable from such statistics.  
(d) In special circumstances  
We may disclose personal data in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this data is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with the rights or property of those described above in paragraph (a) or (b).
