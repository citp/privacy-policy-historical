This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms and Conditions therefore by accepting the Terms and Conditions you are consenting to all use of your Data as detailed in this Privacy Policy.

The terms defined in the Terms and Conditions shall have the same meaning when used in this Privacy Policy unless specifically set out below.

If you do not agree to us collecting and using your Data in this manner we may be unable to provide the Website and/or accept your registration as a Member.

  3. Please be assured that we will never disclose your Data to a third party in such a manner that could lead to identification of you as an individual.
  4. In respect of both Website Users and Members, we may gather further Data from you, for example, if you email comments, request further services or enter a competition or promotion offered by the Company. Furthermore, the Company may have access to details of your Website habits including the dates and number of times you visit the Website and the transactions you carry out through the Website.
  5. In order to provide the Website and Surveys we may enter into contracts with third parties for the provision of the Website, for example, our internet service provider and Website host. In facilitating the Website such third parties may have access to your Data.
  6. From time to time we may forward your Data to third parties whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not wish your Data to be forwarded to such third parties please tick [insert box].

  10. We may use third party advertising agencies to display banner ads on the Website. Banner ads may contain cookies, and appear to be coming from the Website but in reality they are coming from our third party advertising partners, who are providing advertisements on the Website. As such [if you click on the third party banner] your Data may be accessible to the relevant third party advertising agencies.
  11. The Website contains links to third party websites. Also, in order to access certain parts of the Website, promotions or offers you may have to download software from the third parties. In using third party links and/or downloading software from third parties, you may make your Data accessible to those third parties. Please note that we do not have any control over such websites or downloads. Therefore we cannot be liable for the protection and privacy of any Data which you provide whilst visiting such facilities.

If you register to become a Member your identity shall be confirmed by reference to unique information such as a user name and password. The user name and password shall enable you to participate in the Surveys and may allow you to access parts of the Website which are not available to individuals who are not Members. It is your responsibility to keep your user name and password confidential.
  4. We take all reasonable steps to require those parties to whom we transfer Data to comply with the same levels of protection as we do. However, you acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of Data, except to the extent we are required to accept such liability under the Data Protection Act 1998.
  5. Owing to the global nature of the internet infrastructure, the Data you provide may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European economic area, which do not have similar protections in place regarding your Data and its use as set out in this Privacy Policy. However, we have taken reasonable steps to try to improve the security of Data. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers.
