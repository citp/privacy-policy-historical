# Privacy Notice - OneLogin

_Last modified May 15, 2018_

OneLogin, Inc. (“OneLogin”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information while using our Web site ([www.onelogin.com](https://www.onelogin.com/)) OneLogin has established this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to describe how we collect and use your personal data if and when you use our Web site as a “Visitor” or provide information to us in connection with your use of the Service as a “Subscriber”.

## Who We Are

You may contact us under OneLogin Inc., 100 California Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94111.

Our EU representative is: OneLogin Ltd, 2 Sheraton Street, W1F 8BH London.

You may contact our Data Protection Officer at [privacy@onelogin.com](mailto:privacy@onelogin.com).

## The Information We Process

  * **Information you provide** : When a Subscriber registers for the Service, we require a first and last name, company name, email, and phone number. After the initial registration, the Subscriber’s designated Client Administrator can share additional end user information with OneLogin in order to enable those end users to use the Service; however, OneLogin never directly collects any end user information, personal or otherwise, without the explicit direction of the Client Administrator. Subscribers are responsible for providing notice to end users concerning the information they collect and share with OneLogin as part of their use of the Service.

  * **Cookies** : When you visit the Web site or use the Service, we use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Web site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable OneLogin to process your online transactions.Please see the “Use of Cookies” section for further information.

  * **Clear Gifs** : We also use third party advertising and tracking tools that employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), to help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the movements of the visitors to our Web site. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our Visitors and Subscribers in order to optimize and enhance the Web site and Service experience. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
  * **Log Files** : As is true of most Websites, we and our third party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.
  * **HTML5** : We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use local storage objects (HTML5) to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 Local Storage.
  * **Analytics and Remarketing** : OneLogin uses remarketing on the Web site with Google Analytics and services like AdRoll to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. OneLogin and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using Google’s Ads Preferences Manager. If you wish to not have your information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.



If you do not provide the listed personal data to us, we may not be able to provide you with certain features of our Web site.

## How We Process Personal Data

OneLogin uses the personal data including your use of the Service to operate and make the Service available to you, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact you about your use of the Service, research purposes, and to generally improve the content, functionality, and security of the Web site and the Service. OneLogin will also use the collected personal information to send you periodic newsletters to inform you about OneLogin and our services.

The processing is based on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1)(f) of the GDPR).

We may use personal data provided as testimonials, which is always based on consent (Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR).

We do not use automated decision-making, including profiling.

## Sharing Information With Third Parties

OneLogin uses a third party intermediary to perform credit card processing when registering for the paid Subscription plans of the Service. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on OneLogin’s behalf.

OneLogin may also transmit personal data to its third party vendors and the hosting partners that provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and maintenance services required to operate and maintain the Web site and the Service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients. This may require that your personal data be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of OneLogin and these authorized third parties.

## Recipients of the Personal Data

  * Host providers,
  * Payment providers,
  * Email service providers,

In addition, we strive to be as transparent as possible and we will periodically publish the number of requests received and responded to annually per the current Department of Justice guidelines.
  * **Business Transitions** : If OneLogin is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal data.

  * **Testimonials** : We post customer testimonials on our Web site which may contain personal data. We obtain a customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post that customer’s name along with their testimonial. A customer may always withdraw such consent at [privacy@onelogin.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20180907172233id_/http%3A//www.onelogin.com/privacy@onelogin.com), without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
