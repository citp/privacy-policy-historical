## Privacy Policy

**Effective May 26, 2016**

**1\. Introduction  
**This privacy policy (hereafter “ _Privacy Policy_ ”) applies to the Site (as the term “Site” is defined in Our Terms of Service, or “ _Terms_ ”) and all Site content and/or materials accessed via the Site. The Terms can found at the following link: <http://oneplussystems.com/legal-statement/>. All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms, and the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy constitute additional Terms.

**2\. General  
**We respect Your privacy and We are committed to protecting personally identifiable information that may be accessed or submitted through the Site. We have adopted this Privacy Policy to explain what information may be collected on our Site, how We may use this information, and under what circumstances We may disclose the information to third parties.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information We collect through the Site, and does not apply to our collection of information from any other sources. We keep this Privacy Policy posted on the Site and you should review it frequently, as it may change from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site.

**WHEN YOU ACCESS OUR SITE AND/OR USE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE VIA THE SITE YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING OUR SITE.**

**3\. Information We May Collect  
**Our Site typically collects two kinds of information about You: (a) information that You voluntarily provide which may personally identify You; and (b) general information relating to Your use of the Site that does not personally identify You and that We automatically collect when You visit our Site.

**A.** _Personally Identifiable Information_ : For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc. (hereafter “ _PII_ ”). As a general policy, We may not require users to provide Us with any PII in order to use certain portions of the Site; However, certain information may required of You if You wish to take certain actions which may be allowed by the Site, including registering as a user, submitting payments, and other actions, and portions of the information so submitted may be PII.

**B.**   _Non-Personal Information_ : Our definition of non-personal information includes any information that does not personally identify You (“ _Non-PII_ ”). Non-personal information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We may obtain non-personal information about you from information that You may provide to us (e.g. by submitting a contact request, etc.), either separately or together with your PII. We also automatically collect certain Non-PII from you when you access our Site. This information can include, among other things, IP addresses, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.), the third party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Macintosh OS, etc.), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, NetZero, etc.), the specific areas of the Site that you visit, the duration of your visit, and other general information.

**4\. How We Use and Share Information  
**

**A.  ** _Personally Identifiable Information_ : As noted above, We may not require any PII to access or use certain areas on the Site. If You do provide Us with PII (e.g. by submitting a contact request, or registering on the Site) You agree that We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional information about our products and services or those of our other affiliated companies, or to communicate service notices to you about the Site.

Information that You voluntarily post in any comment or feedback feature maintained on the Site is not PII and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Content (as defined in the Terms) that You voluntarily post on or through any feature of the Site is not PII and is not covered by this privacy Policy.

In certain instances We may share your PII with third party service partners which are under contract with Us and which perform Site-related functions on our behalf, e.g., vendors that provide Us with credit card processing services, assist us with customer service, etc.

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, your personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to any third parties without your prior approval.

**B** **.** ** ** _Non-Personal Information_ : We use Non-PII in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve our services. We may use your Non-PII by itself or aggregate it with information We have obtained from others. We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.

**C.** _IP Addresses_ : We may collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to others, and to track the use of our Site. IP addresses are considered non-personal information and may also be shared as provided above. We reserve the right to use IP addresses and any personally identifiable information to identify a visitor when We feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Service or to: (i) fulfill a government request; (ii) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (iii) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Site, or other users; or (iv) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Site’ users or the general public.

**D.  ** _Cookies_ : We may, from time to time, use cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device, which helps our Web site function better and that do not contain PII) in connection with our Site; and We may analyze the information derived from these cookies for the same purposes as set forth in Section 4.C of this Privacy Policy.
