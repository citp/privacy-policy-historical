  * [UK Data Protection Act 1988 (DPA)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents)
  * [EU Data Protection Directive 1995 (DPD)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046)
  * [EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC)



This site’s compliance with the above legislation, all of which are stringent in nature, means that this site is likely compliant with the data protection and user privacy legislation set out by many other countries and territories as well.

##  Personal information that this website collects and why we collect it

This website collects and uses personal information for the following reasons:

###  Site visitation tracking

Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.

Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer’s IP address which could be used to personally identify you but Google do not grant us access to this. We consider Google to be a third party data processor (see below).

GA makes use of cookies, details of which can be found on [Google’s developer guides.](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage) FYI our website uses the analytics.js implementation of GA.

Disabling cookies on your internet browser will stop GA from tracking any part of your visit to pages within this website.

##  How we store your personal information

As detailed above, if you submit a comment to a post published on this website some personal information will be stored within this website’s database.

Additionally if you fill in a form for one or more of our [opportunities](https://www.oneyoungworld.com/opportunities) or one or more of our [scholarships](https://www.oneyoungworld.com/scholarships), the data you provide in each of these forms will be stored in our database.

When you register to attend the One Young World Summit, the data you provide will be stored in our database. This data is currently stored in an identifiable fashion; a limitation of the content management system that this website is build on (Drupal). In the near future we aim to use encryption to store personal data.

###  Our legal basis for processing your data

When you apply for a One Young World opportunity or scholarship, or register to attend a One Young World Summit, you enter into a contract which requires One Young World to review the content of your application/registration, contact you regarding the outcome of your application/registration and provide you with information necessary for you to take part in the activity for which you have applied. When you do this, One Young World has a lawful basis to process your personal information under Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR as the processing is necessary for One Young World to perform the contract described above.

When you attend a One Young World Summit as a delegate you become a ‘One Young World Ambassador’, this status entitles you to certain ‘Ambassador Benefits’ which include discounts for One Young World events and the right to apply for opportunities reserved for One Young World Ambassadors. One Young World has a legitimate interest in retaining the data you submit as part of your Ambassador profile in order to determine that you are eligible for Ambassador Benefits when you apply for them. If you do wish your data to be removed from the Ambassador database please send your request by email to [privacy@oneyoungworld.com](mailto:privacy@oneyoungworld.com).

When you opt-in to receive a One Young World email newsletter such as the Ambassador Newsletter, or Scholarship newsletter, One Young World relies on your consent as the lawful basis to send the newsletter that you have signed up for. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting [privacy@oneyoungworld.com](mailto:privacy@oneyoungworld.com) or clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link found toward the bottom of all One Young World newsletters.

###  How we use your personal information

Personal information submitted for one or more of our opportunities, scholarships or to register for a One Young World Summit will be used to determine your eligibility for the programme and to provide you with information about the programme for which you have applied.

Many opportunities and scholarships are run in collaboration with third party organisations and, when you apply for these schemes, it may sometimes be necessary for One Young World to share your information with those organisations so that partners can determine your eligibility for the programme. When it may be necessary for One Young World to share such application information it will be made explicit on the relevant application form. One Young World will never provide your personal information to a third party for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

If you attend the One Young World Summit as a delegate, a select amount of the information you provide, will be displayed publicly on your online delegate profile which can be accessed through our [Ambassador Community Database](https://www.oneyoungworld.com/community/ambassadors). The following information will be publicly viewable on your delegate profile:

  * Your full name
  * The country that you are representing at the Summit
  * The languages you speak
  * The education history you provide
  * The organisation you say you currently work with
  * Your role within your current organisation
  * The ‘skills & expertise you indicate you possess
  * The ‘areas of interest’ you indicate on your profile.
  * Your response to the profile question ‘What are you most passionate about and engaged with and why?’
  * Your response to the profile question ‘How have you helped to create positive change in your community, country or organisation?’
  * The different links you enter in your profile (Twitter, Facebook, Website…)



  
If you do not wish your profile to be publicly viewable, please send your request by email to  [privacy@oneyoungworld.com.](mailto:privacy@oneyoungworld.com?subject=Make%20my%20OYW%20profile%20private)

Delegate profiles include a messaging function which enables profile holders to send messages between accounts. When you receive a profile message, our website will send you an email notification. If you do not wish to be able to send or receive profile messages unselect “Personal contact form” in your account section. You can access this section by clicking on “Settings” in the user dropdown menu in the top-right corner (or follow this [link](https://www.oneyoungworld.com/user) and click on edit settings). **You must be logged in to access your settings.**

If you attend the Summit as a delegate the information you provide in your delegate profile will be added to the One Young World Ambassador database. This information is used by the One Young World community team and the volunteers who support them to contact you about One Young World events which may be taking place in your local area, inform you of opportunities that you may be interested in and profile your work or initiatives in One Young World publications. Contact from the community team will primarily come by email but they may also phone you for time to time. If you are a One Young World Ambassador and you do not wish to be contacted by One Young World, please let us know by updating the ‘Preferences section’ of your One Young World profile.

###  Who processes your data?

As soon as you have submitted either an opportunity form, a scholarship application or created a One Young World profile, your submitted data is available for processing by One Young World staff members as well as freelancers that are hired for a specific purpose at a given time during the year. As well as One Young World staff members and freelancers, [Coordinating Ambassadors](https://www.oneyoungworld.com/coordinating-ambassadors) have also access to your data. Both freelancers and Coordinating ambassadors are limited by a written agreement in the amount of processing they are allowed to do with your data.

If you would like to have more information about the Coordinating Ambassadors and their role in the processing of data please email [info@oneyoungworld.com](mailto:info@oneyoungworld.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20and%20coordinating%20ambassadors).
