# Privacy Policy - One Time

We are committed to protecting your privacy. That is because we base our business on trust you place in us. This policy describes our practices regarding personal and account information collected through our web site. 

We will periodically review the appropriateness of this privacy policy and may make, in our discretion, such changes as are necessary. If we decide to change this privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. You should visit our web site periodically to review any changes.

No. We currently do not analyze or look at the secrets in any manual or automated way. A couple of people have suggested we analyze the data anonymously for statistical purposes (to gather stats on weak passwords, etc.). We currently don't have any plans on doing this, but might consider it in the future. We will definitely mention it here if we do.

We feel that this tool is definitely safer than using email or chat tools to send private information. However, if you are concerned that **_any_** third party (ie. us) holding this data is a risk, then you should consider either encrypting the data first and passing the credentials for this one-time via another means, or use something else altogether ([GnuPG is a good candidate](http://www.gnupg.org/)).

The amount and type of personal and account information we collect from you depends on your activities and use of our web site. Below, we explain what information we collect under specific contexts.

  * We use secure, encrypted mechanisms (SSL) when accepting and transmitting information.
  * We regularly perform security audits and updates on our servers.


  * **IP address** \- We collect your IP address to measure our web site traffic and to help prevent malicious use.
  * **Referral web site** \- If you come to our web site via a link, we collect the location of the link that referred you.
  * **Browser and platform** \- We collect information about the browser you are using to help optimize our web site for visitors.
