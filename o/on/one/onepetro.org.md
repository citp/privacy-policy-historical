# OnePetro Privacy Policy

At OnePetro we understand that privacy is important. This page outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use OnePetro, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard information. 

## Payment Information

OnePetro collects payment information (such as a credit card number) for the purpose of completing transactions. OnePetro does not store your credit card information beyond completion of the transaction, nor do we disclose credit card or other financial information to any other individual or organization.

## IP Addresses

OnePetro automatically records the Internet address of the computer accessing the site as well as the time and date of access. This information does not identify you personally, nor does it contain your name or email address. OnePetro uses this information solely for the purpose of diagnosing problems with the OnePetro server and to administer the website.

## Cookies 

OnePetro uses "cookies" to keep track of items that have been added to your cart and to keep track of your preferences. "Cookies" are small text files that help identify you and your preferences when you return to OnePetro. When your browser accesses the site, OnePetro's server checks your browser settings to see if it is permissible to store this identification information on your computer. "Cookies" are not programs, are not known to be damaging to your computer, and are used commonly across the Internet. The “cookies” set by OnePetro do not personally identify you; they simply permit OnePetro's web site to know your preferences (such as currency). "Cookies" are also used to help determine how many unique users access pages on the web site. Most browsers have an optional setting to deny "cookies." If you use this setting, however, you may not be able to use OnePetro's site to its fullest capability. 

## Links 

Certain pages on OnePetro may contain links to other web sites. OnePetro is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such linked sites.

##  Secure Transactions

OnePetro uses industry-standard measures to protect your submission of credit card information to OnePetro. OnePetro uses a secure server and encrypted data transmission using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Technology. SSL Technology encrypts the transmitted information to make it very difficult for anyone other than OnePetro to decode the information. OnePetro's implementation of SSL is authenticated by VeriSign.

You can verify that you are in a secure-transmission portion of OnePetro's website in one of two ways:

  * Look for an unbroken key symbol or lock symbol at the bottom status bar of your browser. This shows that you are in a secured mode. 
  * Look at the URL address in your browser window. When in secured mode, the address changes from http to "https."
