# Privacy Policy | OneSky

Last Updated: May 2, 2014

Your privacy is important to us. Please review the privacy policy below for OneSky’s commitment to safeguarding your privacy online.

## What Information OneSky Collects

OneSky may collect two types of information from users: “personally identifiable information” (such as name and email address) and “aggregate information” (such as frequency of visits to Site, IP address, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type). Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a user. Aggregate information is non- personally identifiable/anonymous information about users of the Site. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information.

Information is collected from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter or fill out a form. Any data OneSky request that is not required will be specified as voluntary or optional.

## How OneSky Uses the Information Collected

OneSky may use the personally identifiable information a user submits for any purposes related to OneSky business, including, but not limited to:

  * To understand a user’s needs and create content that is relevant to the user;
  * To generate statistical studies;
  * To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys;
  * To improve services, information, and products;
  * To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support;
  * To communicate back to the user;
  * To update the user on services, information, and products;
  * To personalize a Site for the user;
