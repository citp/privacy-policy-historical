site and/or your registration for ONECOACH products and services constitute your
consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy,
please do not use the ONECOACH site. </p>

<p>ONECOACH may occasionally update
this Privacy Policy.  When it does, ONECOACH will also revise the "last update”
date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  ONECOACH may make new uses or disclosures
of information collected from clients, such as in connection with an investigation
of a breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life,
health or security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in
compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order, and
in such circumstances, ONECOACH will not inform and obtain the consent of the
client prior to such change. </p>

<p>A client may withdraw
his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time by sending an

site addresses). </p>

<p>ONECOACH has implemented
this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its clients, and

to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is
sent for processing by third parties on ONECOACH's behalf.  </p>

<p>ONECOACH has designated responsibility
for your personal information to its Privacy Officer who ensures compliance with
the principles in this Privacy Policy.  Other ONECOACH individuals may be delegated
to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer. </p>

<p>If ONECOACH is not
able to provide access to some aspect of a client’s personal information, it will
provide reasons for denying access such as; that by doing so would likely reveal
personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential commercial
information or attorney-client privileged communications, or that the information
relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or that its disclosure
could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.</p>

<p>Clients have the
right to request that inaccurate or incomplete information be amended as appropriate,
by contacting ONECOACH or the Privacy Officer as described above.  ONECOACH will
promptly correct such personal information.  </p>
