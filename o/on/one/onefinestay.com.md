## Information automatically collected from your computer

  1. Log files/IP addresses. When you visit the Site our web server automatically records your IP address. This IP address is not linked to any of your personal information. We may also gather other non-personal information (from which we cannot identify you) such as the type of your internet browser which we use to provide you with a more effective service.
  2. Cookies. When you visit the Site we may store some information (commonly known as a “cookie”) on your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means that they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Passwords and credit card numbers are not stored in cookies. A cookie helps you get the best out of the Site and helps us to provide you with a more customised service. We use cookies for the following purposes: 
    1. Storing details about your site preferences (for instance which language you wish to view pages in);
    2. Storing details about any properties you have short-listed;
    3. Enabling our web server to track your session between pages of the site and provide a continuity of experience.
  3. You can block or erase cookies from your computer if you want to (your browser’s help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain parts of the Site are reliant on the use of cookies to operate correctly and may not work correctly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.
  4. When using our site, there are a number third parties who also need to store cookies for essential running of the site. These include but are not limited to: 
    1. Amazon for the running of our load balancers;
    2. to enable Interactive Maps, help us with Analytics and provide remarketing campaigns tailored to your browsing using Google Advertiser Features. If you wish to opt out out of the Google Advertiser Features please click here for details.
  5. If you have any other concerns, please contact us.



## Security

  1. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate technical and organisational measures are carried out in order to safeguard the information we collect from you and protect against unlawful access and accidental loss or damage. These measures may include (as necessary): 
    1. protecting our servers with software firewalls;
    2. locating our data processing storage facilities in secure locations;
    3. encrypting all data stored on our server with an industry standard encryption method that encrypts the data between your computer and our server so that in the event of your network being insecure no data is passed in a format that could easily be deciphered;
    4. when necessary, disposing of or deleting your data so it is done so securely;
    5. regularly backing up and encrypting all data we hold.
  2. We will ensure that our employees are aware of their privacy and data security obligations. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the employees of third parties working on our behalf are aware of their privacy and data security obligations.
  3. This notice and our procedures for handling personal data will be reviewed as necessary.
  4. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use the strict procedures and security features referred to in this clause to try to prevent unauthorised access



## Your privacy rights

The GDPR gives you the following rights in respect of personal data we hold about you. You have the right to:

  2. Ask us to correct any information that we hold about you which is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate.
  3. Ask us to erase your personal information from our files and systems where there is no good reason for us continuing to hold it.
  4. Object to us using your personal information to further our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) or where we are using your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
  5. Ask us to restrict or suspend the use of your personal information, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or our reasons for using it.
  6. Ask us to transfer your personal information to another person or organisation.

Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your personal information and, subject to our retention policy, we will dispose of your data securely (although we may in some circumstances need to continue to process your data, if so then we will confirm the reasons for this).

  3. We review the personal data (and the categories of personal data) we are holding on a regular basis to ensure the data we are holding is still relevant to our business and is accurate. If we discover that certain data we are holding is no longer necessary or accurate, we will take reasonable steps to correct or delete this data as may be required. 
  4. If you wish to request that data we hold about you is amended or deleted, please refer to the Your Privacy Rights section above, which explains your privacy rights.



## Other Sites

We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our Site and recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.

In addition, if you linked to this Site from a third party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that third party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.

## Transferring your information outside of Europe

As part of the services offered to you through the Site, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Union (“EU”).

We may also share information between group companies, which may be located in countries worldwide. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. If we transfer your information outside of the EU in this way, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this privacy policy.

If you use the Site while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU in order to provide you with those services.
