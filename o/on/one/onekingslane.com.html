        <strong>How We Use Your Information:</strong> We will not share or
        disclose your information to anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>
        We use personally identifiable information in order to give you a more enjoyable

        programs, or send you offers or information.</p>
    <p>
        In connection with their performance of services to maintain and operate the Site
        and certain features on the Site, certain trusted third parties may be permitted
        to access your information. For example, we may use third parties to host the Site;
        operate various features available on the Site; send emails; analyze data; provide
        search results and links and assist in fulfilling your orders.</p>
    <p>
        We may transfer personally identifiable information as an asset in connection with
        a proposed or actual merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an
        insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business or as
        part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control. In such
        a circumstance the Transferee would be bound by the terms of this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>

        We reserve the right to disclose information in order to comply with a subpoena,
        court order, administrative or governmental order, or any other requirement of law,
        or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary in order to protect
        our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight
        fraud and credit risk reduction.</p>
    <p>
        We use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate, so that we can
        improve the Site and for business and administrative purposes. We may also use or
        share with third parties for any purpose aggregated data that contains no personally
        identifiable information.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>How We Protect Your Information:</strong> We are committed

        and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity
        of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we
        believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems
        to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
    <p>

        The Site encrypts your credit card number and other personal information using secure
        socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the information

        such access.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences:</strong>
        If you are a registered user, you may access and update your registration information
        and your preferences to receive email or other communications from us by sending
        an email to <a href="mailto:customercare@onekingslane.com">customercare@onekingslane.com</a>. Any
        user who receives an email invitation to join the Site may choose not to receive
        such invitations in the future by following the instructions in the email invitations
        and, in addition, if you are a member, you may also choose not to receive such invitations

        your opt-out requests promptly, but you may still receive communications from us
        for up to ten business days as we process your request.</p>

    <p>
        While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of your information,
        we reserve the right to delete all or any portion of customer information if we
        are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls:</strong> We do
        not solicit any personal information from children. If you are not 18 or older,
        you are not authorized to use the Site. Parents should be aware that there are parental
        control tools available online that you can use to prevent your children from submitting
        information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is
        harmful to minors.</p>
    <p>
