# OnePlace.com - Privacy Policy

| 

At OnePlace.com we strive to bring you the most compelling Christian audio content available on the Internet. It is our goal to keep you, the listeners, completely satisfied with our site and what we have to offer. In order to keep up with the most current developments in the Christian community, we may occasionally need to disclose information about our listeners to select third-party vendors. Accordingly, what follows is a description of how we use the information we collect about you (collectively "Your Information"). 

Information Disclosure   
OnePlace.com reserves the right to provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information to third-party vendors. Generally, these statistics will include no personal identifying information. OnePlace.com may also release Your Information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with the law and law enforcement officials, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of our Terms of Use, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of OnePlace.com, our users, or others. Also, some or all of Your Information may be turned over to third-party vendors who assist us in fulfilling some of the functions of this Web site. Finally, we may provide Your Information to third parties if you authorize us to do so.

Occasionally OnePlace.com will pass this list to select vendors who we trust to provide products or services that may be of interest to our audience.
