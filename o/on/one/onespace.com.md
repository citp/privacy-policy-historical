**1\. Introduction**

Thanks for choosing OneSpace!

At OneSpace, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future. To do this, we need to understand your preferences so we can deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you. That said, your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.

That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.

**2\. About this Policy**

This Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationship with OneSpace. The Policy applies to all OneSpace services, including but not limited to Merchandiser, juggle.com, crowdsource.com, onespace.com, work.onespace.com, projects.onespace.com, insights.onespace.com, transcribe.com, write.com, manager.onespace.com, developer.onespace.com, and any associated services (referred to as the ‘OneSpace Service’). The terms governing your use of the OneSpace Service are defined in our [Terms of Service](https://www.onespace.com/merchandiser-terms-of-service/) (the “Terms of Service”).

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any change to the way we collect or process your personal data, we will provide you with more information and additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.

The aim of this Policy is to:

  1. Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;
  2. Explain the way we use the personal data that you share with us in order to give you a great experience when you are using the OneSpace Service; and
  3. Explain your rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and how we will protect your privacy.



We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you. For information on how to contact us if you ever have any questions or concerns, please see the ‘How to Contact Us’ Section 14 below. Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use the OneSpace Service.

**3\. Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control**

You may be aware that a new European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we have implemented additional transparency to help users be aware of those rights. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:

  * Right of Access - the right to be informed of and request access to the personal data we process about you;
  * Right to Rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;
  * Right to Breach Notification – the right to be notified within 72 hours of a data breach that is likely to result in a risk to your privacy rights;
  * Right to Erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;
  * Right to Restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
  * Right to Object - 
    * the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
    * the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
  * Right to Data Portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service; and
  * Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.

We use technical service providers to help us communicate with you, as described in Section 6 of this Policy.  
We also may share personal data with certain marketing and advertising partners to send you promotional communications about OneSpace.  
OneSpace Partners | Depending on how you sign up for the OneSpace Service (e.g. through a third-party service or a mobile provider), we share your OneSpace username or other Account Registration Data as necessary to enable your account.  
Other OneSpace Group Companies | We will share your personal data with other OneSpace Group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the OneSpace Service to you.  
Law Enforcement and Data Protection Authorities | We will share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena. 

We also will also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.  
  
Purchasers of our business | We will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer. In this situation, OneSpace will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.  
  
**8\. Data retention and deletion**

We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the OneSpace Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the OneSpace Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes. We keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the OneSpace Service. For example, we keep your watchlists and account information.

If you request, we will delete or anonymize your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless, we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:

  * If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;

  * Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.



**9\. Transfer to other countries**

OneSpace may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your home country. Your personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence.

Personal data collected within the European Union may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union. In such instances OneSpace shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organizational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.

For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see the ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ Section 11 of this Policy.

**10\. Links**

We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites. We cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content. If you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the OneSpace Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy. Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.

**11\. Keeping your personal data safe**

We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely secure. We have implemented various policies including pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.

Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the OneSpace Service.

**12\. Children**

The OneSpace Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years. However, in some countries, stricter age limits may apply under local law. Please see our [Terms of Service](https://www.onespace.com/merchandiser-terms-of-service/) for further details.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”). If you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the OneSpace Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.

If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to OneSpace, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in this Policy.

If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the OneSpace account for that child.

**13\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the OneSpace Service or by sending you an email. We may notify you in advance.

Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.
