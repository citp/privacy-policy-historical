END USER INFORMATION

The OneSignal SDK collects data for the purposes of providing developers with functionality to target and personalize the notifications they send to end-users. This data collection is limited to the data available to the application that includes the OneSignal SDK.

This data may also be shared with OneSignal Partners and Clients who leverage such data in order to personalize their Offerings to you, and for cross-app advertising.

Information Collected:

This data may include items such as:

1) Your device's Advertising Identifier

2) Your email address.

2) Some or all of the following information: IP address, device push token, precise location, network information, language, timezone, product preferences, and privacy preferences.

Some of the data and information we collect can indirectly be used to identify you (such as your device’s Advertising ID until it is reset), while other data and information (such as your location) can only be used to identify you when combined with other information. We use some of this data and information in an anonymized and/or aggregated form that does not identify you personally, in order to improve our services, perform web and mobile analytics, and work with entities with which we have a strategic relationship.

Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data partner we have engaged may collect and store a unique identifier matched to your mobile device, in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use applications or surf the internet, or to seek to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers.  In order to customize these ads or content, we or a data partner may connect de-identified demographic or other data about you (received from third parties) either to data passively collected from you, such as your device identifier or IP address.  However, we will share your email address solely in hashed, non-human readable form.

In the case of mobile appliations, the collection of data continues under this Policy until you either: (a) remove any application that integrates the OneSignal SDK from your device, or (b) opt-out of interest-based ads on your mobile device’s settings.

Each third party publisher and application developer is responsible for obtaining all applicable consents required to enable OneSignal to collect information from your device or browser. Your installation of such an app constitutes a legally binding acceptance of this Policy.
