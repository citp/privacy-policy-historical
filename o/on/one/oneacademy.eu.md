**PRIVACY POLICY**

The Company recognizes and supports the importance of protecting the privacy of information we may collect from you. To this end, we are committed to using our best efforts to respect your privacy. Below you will find our policies for how the Company handles information we collect from you from your visits to the OneAcademy website. The Company follows strictly all relevant Laws and Regulations.

**OneAcademy way of using information**

The profile information Users provide is protected by unique password and is accessible only by the User.

Users can change their Profile information at any time and can control how other Users and the Company communicates with them.

If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at info@oneacademy.eu

We receive and store information you enter on the OneAcademy website or give us in any other way. We use such information, including your name and e-mail address, for several purposes such as:

To process, fulfill and notify you of your product order status; and

To inform you about the latest information about our Company, updates in policies and procedures, promotions and changes in strategy.

From time to time we collect personal information from our Users. Where permitted by the provisions of applicable laws the Company may use and disclose such personal information about our Users. for the following purposes:

Administering Users benefits;

Developing and implementing policies, marketing plans and strategies;

Publishing personal information in company’s’ newsletters, promotional materials and company and intra-group communications;

Providing references; and

Complying with applicable laws and regulatory requirements and assisting with any governmental or police investigation; and

Other purposes directly relating to any of the above.

Additionally, User preferences and settings (time zone, language, privacy preferences, product preferences, etc.) may be collected to enhance the Service.

As is standard practice on many websites, the Company also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate User data, and browser type, from Users and other visitors to the site or application. This data is used to improve the Services, to analyze trends, to administer the Services, to track Users’ movements around the Service and to gather demographic information about our User base as a whole. The Company will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third parties to provide more relevant services and special offers to Users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

In addition, the Company and third parties may use pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what parts of our website Users have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches Users perform on our site, among other data. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in formats Users can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we’re only sending messages that are of interest to our Users. The Company stores the information we gather in a database stored on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. To the extent that third parties gather information, they store that information and are responsible for their use of the same. 

The Company may also use a User’s email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. The Company may send email communications which use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the OneAcademy website. When a User clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. The Company tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our Users communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

The Company may also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our Users and thus provide more valuable service. The Company also collects information regarding User activities on our website, and on related websites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to Users and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most interest to them.

**THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING**

As a resource to our visitors, we may provide links to other websites, which OneAcademy believe may be useful and meet our high standards of services.

Ads appearing on OneAcademy may be delivered to Users by OneAcademy or third party advertisers. These third parties may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer or mobile device each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer or mobile device, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

We have implemented the necessary security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information you provide. When you become a User of OneAcademy or give us personal information, such as name, address, including any other information the Company may consider necessary for the accurate User identification, it is automatically saved on our secured server. Our secured server software encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us to protect your data against unauthorized access.

Please note that OneAcademy cannot guarantee the security of User account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.

These companies may help us process information, deliver products to you, manage and enhance User data, provide User service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct User research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with OneAcademy’s policies. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive User service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the OneAcademy website or application.
