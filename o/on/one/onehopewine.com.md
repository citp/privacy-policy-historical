This site does not use interactive tools that ask you for identifying personal information.

**Security of Communications**

We recognize that many people are concerned about the privacy and protection of information as it is transmitted over the Internet. You should keep in mind that the possibility exists for unauthorized individuals to intercept any email message you send over the Internet. In some cases, information can be encrypted (scrambled or encoded) to make it very difficult to read if it is intercepted during communication. Certain technology and practices allow Web sites to provide an increased level of security for your personal information when appropriate.

We use the following practices on our Web site to enhance the level of security for communication and the transmission of personal information:

  * We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site

**E-Commerce and Online Shopping**

Purchasing items over the Internet usually requires you to provide your personal identifying information and credit card information on a Web site. Many people have become accustomed to on-line commerce as a time-saving and useful convenience. There are a number of practices that can make providing your sensitive credit card information more secure and therefore make you feel more comfortable about doing so.

We do process credit card payments for merchandise, or services on our Web site. We have the following e-commerce practices:

  * When processing your credit card payment, we will ask for the card type, number, expiration date, and your card's billing address.
  * We will transmit credit card numbers in an encrypted format using industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
  * We will keep this information in the strictest confidence and will make every effort to maintain the privacy and security of the information at all times.



**Advertising Servers**

On-line advertising, such as banner ads, has become commonplace on many Web sites. Certain Web sites have developed relationships with third-party advertising servers to display these advertisements on their sites. By clicking on one of these banner ads, you will be taken to another site with different privacy policies. These third party ad servers may also use cookies to collect non-personal information on your preferences and interests via the advertisement you decide to view.

At this time, we do not partner with or have special relationships with any advertising server companies.

**Links to Other Sites**
