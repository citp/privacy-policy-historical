We created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and share the information that we collect from and about you on this Site. By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collected

If you refuse to provide any requested information (whether or not required), you may not be able to take full advantage of this Site and its features. Personal information includes any information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or Social Security number, and any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual. On certain Sites, we may also collect from you information about your contacts, such as their email address, to share an article or other content.

_Information from Third Parties:_ We may also collect information about you from third parties, like credit reporting agencies or a social media site or a plug-in you use to log into or connect to this Site, and authorize to send us information from that social media account (e.g., name, age, photo). We may associate or combine the information you provide through this Site with this information collected from third parties.

_Information Automatically Collected:_ When you use this Site, the server may automatically recognize you by a “cookie” or other tracking technology.

Our advertisers, publishers and other third-party partners also may utilize third-party cookies and other tracking technologies like clear pixel GIFs (i.e., web beacons) to identify you.
