 ** _OneWayFurniture.com Privacy Policy_**

This site www.onewayfurniture.com (“One Way Furniture”) is hosted by Yahoo! Store. Yahoo! hosts the store pages, ordering system, and order data. Yahoo! automatically collects order information but may only use this information in the aggregate. If you accessed this store through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically collects information about your shopping experience. Please see the [Yahoo! Privacy Policy](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/details.html) for more information about how Yahoo! uses this information. Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use our gallery’s array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence. We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how One Way Furniture collects information from all users of [ One Way Furniture ](http://www./) both those who contact us without making a purchase ("Visitors") as well as those who make a purchase ("Customers"); what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Customers have concerning the collection and use of such information. One Way Furniture requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. 

**_Introduction_**

One Way Furniture is structured around a Yahoo! Store. Any information provided on our Web site is collected by Yahoo! Store on their servers from Visitors and Customers who access the web site. That information is then shared with One Way Furniture. This information includes ordering information such as shipping and billing names and addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and credit card information. (See “Orders” below.) We use this information primarily to fulfill customer orders and requests. We do not share this information with any third parties except as described in this privacy policy. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below.

 ** _Orders and Use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)_**

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain PII from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

If your PII changes, or if you no longer desire remain as a One Way Furniture customer, you may correct, update, or delete it by emailing Customer Support at 1-800-789-1995.

  * **Registration**
\- Once you place an order you may be asked if you would like to create a username and password for your account if you use our customer support help desk. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site and so that you can track your order information.
  *  **Testimonials**
\- If we receive permission to post testimonials from your shopping experience, we only post first names and last initials. Your PII information is fully protected.
 ** _Security_**

If you feel uncomfortable shopping online please call us toll free at 1-800-789-1995. You may also e-mail, or fax your order. Please do not e-mail us your credit card information, only do that via telephone, fax or online at our Yahoo! Store page. The ordering information you provide - including credit card information - is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology via Yahoo! Store servers. Yahoo! Store uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time a Yahoo! Store asks for a credit card number during checkout for payment, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on Yahoo! servers. This SSL technology is used to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites. While Yahoo! makes every effort to ensure the integrity and security of its network and systems, they cannot guarantee that their security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Privacy Policy for more information about how Yahoo! uses this information.
