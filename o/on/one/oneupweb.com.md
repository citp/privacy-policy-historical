_Voluntarily submitted information_  
When you submit a form requesting our research papers, studies, newsletters, other resources and/or requesting some information or correspondence, we sometimes ask you for your name, company name, email address, postal address, phone and/or other information. Voluntarily submitted information may be subject to additional terms and restrictions agreed upon at the time the information was submitted.

Non-personal data includes, but is not limited to, language, location, occupation, zip code and area code. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose, including providing aggregate non-personal information to third parties.

In the event that we combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information is treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

**How We Use "Cookies" and Other Technologies**

We may use "cookies" (small data files that assign you a unique identifier) and other technologies, such as pixel tags and web beacons, to help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited and to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. This information is non-personal information; however, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. You may use your browser’s preferences to disable cookies, but understand that by doing so, you may cause certain aspects of the website to operate incorrectly or otherwise limit the functionality of the website. 

Third parties that link on this site may use cookies or collect other information when you go to their site. We do not control the collection or use of your information by these companies. You should contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their collection or use of information about you. 

**How We Protect Your Information**

We utilize appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, misuse and alteration. We make reasonable efforts to protect the security of your personally-identifiable information and periodically review and enhance these methods as necessary. However, we make no guarantee that unauthorized, inadvertent disclosures will never occur. All submissions of information by you on our website are made at your own risk.
