<p><strong>Protecting your privacy </strong><br>Your privacy is important to us. <strong>one</strong>world™ pledges to be responsible when gathering your personal information and to protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy should answer your questions about the sources and kinds of information we collect, how we use it, when it may be shared with others, and how we safeguard its confidentiality and security. We also provide you with ways to correct the data you provide us and to limit our sharing of this data with third parties. <strong>one</strong>world reserves the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. If we modify or update our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised policy here, and any modifications will apply to all information collected by <strong>one</strong>world, including previously collected information. </p>

<p><strong>Who we are</strong><br><strong>one</strong>world is an alliance of eight international airlines - American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas, Cathay Pacific Airways, Iberia, LAN, Finnair and Aer Lingus. The alliance is based in Vancouver, Canada. As an alliance, <strong>one</strong>world and its members share information, including personal information. Therefore, as outlined in this Privacy Policy, we may share data about sites' visitors to third parties located both inside and outside Canada.   </p>

<p><strong>Information we collect and how we collect it</strong><br>In order to facilitate your travel, and manage our business, we may collect and maintain personal information about you. <strong>one</strong>world may collect customer information from many sources to understand and meet your needs. We may collect personal information about you from: </p>
<ul>
	<li>You, when you voluntarily provide us with information;</li>
	<li>Your browser, when you visit our websites and your browser interacts with us;</li>
	<li>Our member airlines;</li>
	<li>Other sources, in connection with providing your transportation needs and services. </li>
</ul>
<p>The personal information we may collect about you through these various sources may include, but is not limited to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Name, addresses and telephone numbers</li>
	<li>E-mail addresses, fax numbers and pager numbers</li>
	<li>Frequent Flyer account information</li>
	<li>Information necessary to facilitate travel or other services on our member carriers </li>
	<li>Nationality and country of residence</li>
	<li>Transactional and online activity data pertaining to mileage activity with companies participating in the Frequent Flyer programme </li>
	<li>Use of products and services such as self-service devices, flight status notification and online check-in</li>
	<li>Personal information provided via survey, focus group or other marketing research efforts</li>
	<li>Personal information provided to travel agents and/or customer-service representatives to facilitate travel or other services on our member carriers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aggregate information</strong><br>In addition to obtaining your personal information, when you use our sites, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the sites. <strong>one</strong>world gets this information by using technologies, including cookies to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our sites and to better tailor our sites to our visitors' needs. None of this tracking information identifies you personally; we collect it for reporting onsite activity in the aggregate. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our sites or which pages or features get the most attention.</p>

<p><strong>What this Privacy Policy does not apply to</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Corporate information (unless it is also about any identifiable person)</li>
	<li>Other websites accessed through a link from our websites. In this case the Privacy Policy of the owner of the linked website will apply. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Links</strong><br>Our websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each site that collects information from you. <strong>one</strong>world's Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by <strong>one</strong>world.</p>

<p><strong>Notice to/regarding children under the age of 16</strong><br>If you are under 16 years of age, you should not provide any personally identifiable information (for example, your last name, home address or e-mail address) to <strong>one</strong>world without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian. If <strong>one</strong>world learns that you are under 16 years of age, <strong>one</strong>world will not maintain or use any personally identifiable information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent or guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to participate in some activities on the sites without that verifiable consent. </p>
<p><strong>one</strong>world believes that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the <strong>one</strong>world websites and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.</p>

<p><strong>How your information will be used</strong><br>We use your personal information to facilitate our member carriers in providing travel related products and services to you.</p>

<p><strong>Who we share your personal information with</strong><br>We will not sell your name or other private profile information to third parties, and do not intend to do so in the future. We routinely share your information with our <strong>one</strong>world member airlines and their subsidiaries.  From time to time, we may engage third parties to process information on our behalf and in doing so, we may share your personal information with these third parties; however, <strong>one</strong>world requires that these third parties comply with <strong>one</strong>world's Privacy Policy and principles when using and/or processing this information. We may share anonymous, non-personal aggregated information about all our users with third parties.</p>
<p>If you indicate that you wish to receive promotional offers, <strong>one</strong>world may also send you promotional offers in connection with its promotional partners. </p>

<p><strong>How <strong>one</strong><span class="nb">world</span> uses cookies and similar technologies</strong><br><strong>one</strong>world uses cookies, tags, and other similar technologies as a means of collecting non-sensitive information on general websites usage so that we may improve your experience on our websites.  </p>
<p>These cookies are not designed to identify you personally and the information they gather is used only to guide improvements in navigation, enhance content and provide a means for us to ensure that our websites continue to meet sites users' needs. These cookies are not used for any promotional purposes. If you would like to browse the <strong>one</strong>world websites you may do so without accepting cookies.</p>

<p><strong>How to find out what information we have concerning you and with whom we have shared it</strong><br>At any time, you can find out what personal information we have, what it is being used for and to whom it has been disclosed. We will do our best to provide the required information to you within a reasonable time period and will provide an explanation if we are unable to meet your request.</p>

<p><strong>How to change your personal information, if it is inaccurate</strong><br>Simply contact the Privacy Officer at the address below and indicate which information is incorrect. We will correct inaccurate or incomplete information within a reasonable time and will notify you when we have done so. In the unlikely event we have given incorrect information to others, including our member carriers, we will ensure they are advised of the required corrections.</p>

<p><strong>How long do we keep your personal information?</strong><br>We only keep your personal information on file for as long as we need it to provide you with service and to meet legal requirements. When we no longer need the information, it is either destroyed or made anonymous.</p>

<p><strong>What safeguards do we employ to keep your personal information confidential?</strong><br>We have implemented procedures and installed equipment to safeguard the security and confidentiality of your information. We continually review and improve these arrangements to ensure that we are doing all that is reasonably and technically feasible at this time to protect your information.</p>
<p>Only those employees who need personal information to provide service have access to it. It is a condition of employment that all <strong>one</strong>world employees conform to our Privacy Policy and promise to observe the highest standards of confidentiality for each customer's personal information.</p>

<p><strong>How to voice any questions, concerns or complaints you may have relating to your privacy</strong><br>If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about the way in which your personal information is collected or used by <strong>one</strong>world please contact the Privacy Officer at:</p>
