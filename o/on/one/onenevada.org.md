# Privacy Policy - One Nevada Credit Union | Serving Las Vegas, Pahrump and Reno, Nevada - Loans, Checking, Savings, Investments and Insurance

We recognize our obligation to keep member information secure and confidential. This obligation is very important to us. Our commitment to protect your financial information will continue under the guidelines described below. We reserve the right to make changes to our privacy guidelines whenever warranted to further protect our member’s financial information. Comments on your privacy can be [e-mailed](https://ssl8.onenevada.org/form/email-us.aspx) to us.

## Internet Browsers and Online IDs

We have taken all appropriate measures to ensure that our website and home banking product is secure, and that our members’ account information remains private. Our members also play a role in protecting their credit union account information. Your online banking Account ID and Password should be provided only when your browser shows a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) session is taking place. Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encode (scramble) account information between computers, so that it is virtually impossible to be read by others. We recommend that our members use a current version of browser software so that they may benefit from the most up to date internet security available. After you finish any website session that included viewing or sending private information you should close your browser window.

## Computer “Cookies”

A “cookie” is a small text file placed on your hard drive by a web server. “Cookies” are commonly used on websites and do not harm your computer system. We use cookies to provide a more interactive and helpful website and to customize the information you see. You can control how a cookie will be handled (accepted or rejected) on your computer by configuring your preferences or options in your browser software. We use cookies for administration purposes of our website. We never combine information collected through a cookie to e-mail you, or to gain confidential account information.

## Collecting and Using Member Information

For our internal use, we collect the following information about you:

  * Information we receive from you on applications and other forms, such as name, address, social security number, assets and income; and
  * Information about your transactions with us, such as account balances, payment history, parties to transactions and credit card usage; and
  * Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies, such as credit worthiness and credit history.



Any information we collect is used to service our member accounts and to help us learn more about the financial products or services they would be interested in. Collecting information from our website helps us provide better products and services. We do gather and analyze data regarding usage of our website, including domain name, number of page hits, pages visited, length of user session, time of day, day of week, etc., to evaluate and improve our website.

We restrict access to protected information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to protect your information.

If you choose to close your account(s) with us or if you become an inactive member, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this statement.

## Website Calculating and/or Planning Tools

One Nevada’s e-mail response back to the sender will not include confidential account information.

## Sharing or Selling Account Information

To assist us in offering you services, we may at times choose to share information with companies that work for us, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.
