<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (<em>e.g</em>., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process);</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, any term or condition of the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, our Community Requirements or any of Additional Terms or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of us, our parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, our Services, any of our operational service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, other users, registered users, Subscribers or any other party;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests, or to comply with any legal and regulatory obligations; or</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Protection of Personal Information.</strong> We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites and wireless and mobile communications, it is possible third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Service in the same way. We also limit access to our Services by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy.</p>

You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age or wireless or mobile device numbers, may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information, but cannot be deleted and if you delete or attempt to delete such information, it may result in the suspension of any and all rights you may have to use our Services, your status as a Registered User, Subscriber and/or other aspects of our Service or offers we make available to you. If you have registered for or subscribed to any Services or provided any information as part of an account or profile in connection with our Service, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information and you should go to our Website and follow the instructions there that will explain how you can edit, change, update and, with some exceptions noted, delete your Personal Information.</p>
<p>If you do not understand or are not sure what Personal Information may be collected or used for particular purposes, you should contact our Privacy Administrator via email with a request at <a href="mailto:privacy@onebip.com">privacy@onebip.com</a> and be prepared to provide verification of your identity.</p>
<p>Personal Information collected for certain offers and promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request unless the user is under the age of 18. Parents of Minors who wish to terminate or cancel their Minor’s use of all or any portion of our Services or modify any selections the Minor may have made, must notify us by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@onebip.com">support@onebip.com</a> and provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible Minor before making any changes to or terminations of the Minor’s registration. We will not allow direct access to any Personal Information by any person without the Registered User’s or Subscriber’s User appropriate identification. Parent will be required to send an email to the <a href="mailto:support@onebip.com">support@onebip.com</a> that includes the parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the Minor’s name and wireless or mobile device number or email address as shown in our records, as a user, and service password. We will send a confirming email to the parent via the wireless or mobile device number or email address provided by the parent to verify the parent wishes to terminate his or her Minor’s registration. The parent must confirm by sending a reply to the return address designated by us. We will then terminate the Minor’s account and registration as requested by the parent and will notify the Minor of the termination request either by SMS text message or email, identifying the name, address and contact information submitted by the parent, legal guardian or other authorized person who made the request.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration, subscription, status as a Registered User, Subscriber, and/or the use of or access to any or all of our Services and any other services, content, activities, features or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use or access any portion of our Service, to use or access any information. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to such information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.</p>
