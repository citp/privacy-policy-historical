If you are a minor, please do not provide us or other website visitors with any personal information. </span><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">This Policy Is Part Of Our Terms And Conditions Of Use</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">Our website privacy policy is a part of, and subject to, our website's terms and conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions on our website.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">The type of information we collect from you and interest-based advertising.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic information such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website, your computer's operating system, and the type of web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records this basic information about you.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">And like many other websites, we may use cookies, click redirects, pixel tags, container tags, and similar technologies. In plain English, this means information that our website's server transfers to your computer. This information can be used to track your session on our website and to customize our website content for you as an individual. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">If you are using one of the common Internet Web browsers, you can set up your browser to either (a) let you know when you are being tracked by us or to (b) deny us tracking access to your computer or electronic mobile device. The manufacturer of the browser you use has instructions on how to modify tracking settings. You may find these instructions in the “Help” section of your browser or by contacting the browser’s manufacturer.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">If you download or use mobile software applications (“Mobile Apps”) from our website, we may know your location. In addition, your smart phone, computer tablet, or other electronic device using our Mobile Apps may provide us information about the device, including its unique identifier, make and model, operating system, mobile network carrier, and your telephone number.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">We may also collect any data that you provide us by posting it at our website or by sending to us via email. You can always choose not to provide us with information. However, if you do withhold information, we may deny you access to some or all of our website's services and features.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">Some transactions between you and our website may involve payment by credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment services. In such transactions, we will collect information related to the transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, including your billing address, telephone number, and other information related to the transaction.</span><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">What We Do With Your Information</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">We use your information to operate our website's business activities. For example, we may use this data to contact you about changes to our website, new products and services, special offers, resolve disputes, troubleshoot issues, and enforce our website's terms and conditions.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">If you download or use Mobile Apps from our website, the information we learn about you may be used by us to give you personalized content based upon your location and other data you share. If you do not want to share your location via Mobile Apps, check the instruction manual for your electronic device or contact your device’s manufacturer to see if you can turn off the locator feature.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">As a general rule, we will not give your data to third parties without your permission. However, there are some important exceptions to this rule that are described in the following paragraphs.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">We may, in our sole discretion, provide information about you to law enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud investigations, alleged intellectual property infringement, or any other suspected illegal activity or matters that may expose us to legal liability.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">Some government intelligence agencies have the technological ability to access data from our website without our cooperation, knowledge, or consent. Even if we were to learn of such access, we may not be able to tell you because of national security laws. Please take this risk into account before supplying information to us or any other website owner.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">Although we do not disclose individually identifiable information, we may disclose aggregate data about our website's visitors to advertisers or other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">From time to time, we may use third party suppliers to provide services on our website. If a supplier wants to collect information about you, you will be notified. However, you will never be required to give information to a third party supplier. We restrict the way third party suppliers can use your information. They are not allowed to sell or give your information to others.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;">If we sell our website, we may transfer your information to the purchaser of the site.

If we become aware of a data vulnerability, where economically feasible, we will attempt to promptly fix it in order to keep your data safe.
