We may share such non-personal data with third parties.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**  


While Onwardclick does not use tracking, we may at any time use "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about website activity. For example, when someone visits the website, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the website previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. If you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the website.  


Pixel tags and cookies may be used in email messages that we send you directly or via a third party.

If you have agreed to receive emails from us, those emails may contain advertising about goods and services that we think might be of interest to you. In order to understand how our readers interact with the emails and the content that we send, we use pixels in the text in order to understand who has opened the emails that they have been sent. In order to provide our content in the most interesting way, we also use pixels to learn whether you can receive emails in text or html form. If you click on a link in the email, we may set a cookie on your browser. If you visit this website as a result of clicking on a link, we are able to understand how you interact with the pages of our website through the combination of the cookie and pixels set on the pages of our website. This enables us to understand what interested you in our emails and what did not, and what interests you about our website and what does not. We can then try to send you more interesting information in the future. Please note that this information is for our use only - we do not disclose or share this information with any third parties.
