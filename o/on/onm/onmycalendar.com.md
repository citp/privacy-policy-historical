The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, device type and timestamps. 

Referral information. If you arrive at a OnMyCalendar website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us. 

Information we collect from other sources. If you are an Account User or Website Visitor, from time to time, we may obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers and our joint marketing partners. We take steps to ensure that such third parties are legally or contractually permitted to disclose such information to us. 

**If you are an Account User, we also collect:**

Userid information. When you create a OnMyCalendar userid, we collect your first and last name, username, password, and email address. If you choose to use two-factor authentication, we also collect your phone number.

When you create a OnMyCalendar account, we collect your billing details, a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding to your method of payment (e.g. credit card number). If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder. You may also set various preferences and personal details such as your default language, time zone, and communication preferences. 

Information you want to publish. Many OnMyCalendar services allow you to publish information to the Internet. Examples are general web pages, calendars of your public events, and forms for web visitors to fill out. OnMyCalendar does not require any specific information. You choose which information you want to publish. 

**If you are a Respondent, we also collect:**

Information the Account Owner requests on their forms. In filling out an Account Owner's form, you will be providing information to the Account Owner.

If you are a Respondent, you will need to ask the Account Owner how long your responses will be stored in OnMyCalendar services. 

### 7\. Children's personal information

"Minors" are individuals under the age of 13. We do not use Minors' data for targeted marketing and/or advertisements, or rent or sell it to anyone. 

Our services are not designed or intended for Minors to be Account Owners or Users. OnMyCalendar does not knowingly collect personal data from Minors. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a Minor, we may delete this information without notice. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact us at Support@OnMyCalendar.com. 

The Childrens' Online Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from Minors. OnMyCalendar relies on the Account Owner (e.g. school, teacher, coach) to obtain verifiable parental consent to provide our services to minors. If you believe an Account Owner is using a Minor's Personal Information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at Support@OnMyCalendar.com.
