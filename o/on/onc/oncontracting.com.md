OnContracting uses "cookies" to collect non-personal data and information.  Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, and is typically placed on your hard disk by a web page server.  Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.   The way cookies function is by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website.

You should be aware that OnContracting cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by OnContracting's third-party partners or advertisers.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Website and OnContracting Service that depend on cookies.
