<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">2 Cookies</h3><p>It is not necessary to accept cookies to visit our website. However, if you would like to place an order or add an item to your shopping basket, you will need to set your browser to accept cookies so you can use the shopping basket and checkout functions. 2.1 What are Cookies? Cookies are small files that are saved on your computer which store specific information about your preferred settings and any other data that our system needs when interacting with your browser. There are two different kinds of cookies: session cookies, which are deleted the moment you quit your browser; and permanent cookies, which are stored on your data carrier for a longer period of time or, in some cases, permanently. Cookies help us to tailor our website to suit you and to reflect your tastes and your browsing habits. They also allow us to save any information you have entered so you don’t have to enter it all again the next time you visit.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">2.2 What kind of cookies do we use?</h3><p>Most of the cookies we use are session cookies which are deleted at the end of your browser session. We use these to allow you to use our shopping basket function across more than page of our site, for example. We do use some cookies that remain on your computer after you have quit your browser. This kind of cookie enables our system to recognise that you’ve visited our website before and to remember which settings and products you preferred. These permanent cookies have a certain lifespan after which they will be automatically deleted. These cookies allow us to collect and analyse data to come up with strategies to improve our website. This makes our website easier for our customers to use and helps us to provide you with personal recommendation of products you may like. Our aim is to offer you a fun, easy shopping experience on a website that is tailored to your tastes.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">2.3 What kind of information is stored in cookies?</h3><h3><p>The cookies used by On are never used to store any personal information. Therefore our cookies cannot be traced back to an individual user. Once a cookie is activated, it is given an ID number, which is solely used for internal reference and cannot be used to identify the user or access any personal information, such as your name or IP address. The anonymised information we receive from the cookies allows us to assess which pages of our site are visited the most and see which products were most popular etc.
<br></p></h3><h3 class="subtitle">2.4 What is on-site targeting?</h3><p>The On website gathers information that could be useful in tailoring our adverts and online offer to our customers. This information is not used to identify you as a user; it is solely used for the optimization of our website. Information collected by our cookies is not stored with our customer’s personal information or order information, it is only used to provide our users with adverts and/or notification of offers and services that are suited to their individual tastes, using click stream analysis (e.g. adverts for reduced trainers if a customer has been browsing our sports shoe selection). Our goal is to provide you with a shopping experience suited to your tastes and shopping preferences.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">2.5 Use of third-party-cookies</h3><p>Cookies from specific business partners are allowed by On for the purpose of tailoring their adverts to your tastes and browsing habits, so cookies from some of our partners may be stored on your computer when you visit our site. These cookies are permanent cookies, which will be automatically deleted from your computer at the end of their lifespan. As with our own cookies, these third party cookies do not collect any personal information. The data stored is collected at certain times, allowing these companies to see which products have been viewed most frequently but this is done completely anonymously under randomly designated user ID numbers. Therefore, this data will never be pooled with any personal information you have given On. Third party cookies have the sole purpose of allowing our partners to advertise products that may interest you.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">2.6 Re-targeting</h3><p>Our website may use retargeting, which allows us to make our online offer more interesting for you. Retargeting technology means we can advertise recently viewed and related products on our partners? websites, meaning our adverts, even on other companies? sites, are relevant to what you would like to see. We do this by analyzing user behavior from data collected by our cookies. This kind of information is anonymous, with no personal information being stored and no user profiles.</p><h3 class="subtitle">2.7 Declaration of Consent</h3><p>By using the On Site and Shop you hereby give permission for your user information to be stored on cookie files. You also allow these files to remain on your computer after you have ended your browser session so they may be used upon your next visit to the website. You reserve the right to retract this permission by changing your browser settings to refuse cookies.<br>
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">2.8 How can I prevent cookies from being stored on my computer?</h3><p>You can change the settings in your browser to ask for your permission every time a cookie tries to access your computer. If you would like to accept On cookies but block our partners? cookies, you can set your browser to block third party cookies.
<br>Usually, your browser’s help section will provide information on how to change your cookie settings.<br>
<br>We recommend only changing the browser setting for your profile on shared computers.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">3 Log Files</h3><p>Every time you visit the Site, information is sent from your browser to our server log files, where it will be saved. The information transferred includes: time and date or visit to our site, which pages were viewed, IP address, URL of site that referred you to On, how much information has been stored and which browser you have been using.<br>
<br>Once we have all this information, all IP addresses are deleted or anonymised. Anonymisation means that your IP address is changed in such a way that they either cannot be linked with the original user or can only be linked through extensive research.<br>
<br>The anonymous information stored in this log file is then used to improve the shopping experience by making our navigation more user-friendly, finding errors quickly and directing our server’s capacity to where it is needed most. For example, this information allows us to work out our busiest times and plan enough server power for those times to keep our site running as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>You hereby give your permission for On to analyse and use protocol data to develop and optimize their Site and Shop.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">4 Sharing of personal data with external parties</h3><p>Your personal data is only shared with third parties in order to fulfill the contract or the payment. These third parties (e.g. the provider of our order management platform, the supply chain company fulfilling the good or the payment provider) may be situated outside your country of residence. You therefore agree that we may share your data with such third parties.<br>
<br>Furthermore we shall only provide third parties with your data in compliance with this privacy policy or if you have explicitely agreed to such transfer beforehand.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">5 Web Analytics</h3><p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (’Google’). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google has declared that they will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">6 Use of Facebook Social Plugins</h3><p>Our website uses social plugins ('plugins') provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ('Facebook'). The plugins are identifiable by a Facebook logo or the notice 'Facebook Social Plugin'. For a full list of all social plugins and their appearance please see <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/plugins">developers.facebook.com/plugins</a>.<br>
<br>When you visit a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser which embeds the latter into the website, enabling Facebook to receive information about your having accessed the respective page of our website. For this purpose, the internet address of the visited site (your IP address included) is transferred to a USA-based Facebook server where the data are stored. This occurs even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not logged into Facebook at the time.<br>
<br>If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking ’Like’, or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. The information can also be published on Facebook, and shown to your Facebook friends.<br>
<br>If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to connect the data concerning your visit to our website with your member data already stored by Facebook, please log off Facebook before entering our website. You can also block Facebook social Plugins by using add-ons for your browser, like the ’Facebook Blocker’.<br>
<br>For information on the purpose and scope of data collection by Facebook and how it is processed and used, as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy please visit Facebook’s privacy policy.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">7 Secure data transfer</h3><p>We have in place appropriate technical and security measures to prevent unauthorised or unlawful access to or accidental loss of or destruction or damage to your information. When we collect data through the Site, we collect your personal details on a secure server. We use firewalls on our servers. When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) coding. Whilst we are unable to guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker to decrypt your details.
<br></p><h3 class="subtitle">8 Your rights and contact regarding data protection</h3><p>If you are concerned about your data, you have the right to request access to the personal data which we may hold or process about you. You have the right to require us to correct any inaccuracies in your data free of charge. At any stage you also have the right to ask us to stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes. For any of the above purposes, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:info@on-running.com&gt;">info@on-running.com</a>.</p>
