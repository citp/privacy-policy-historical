        <p><strong>THIRD PARTY TRACKING AND DO NOT TRACK</strong><br>

These vendors and other partners include advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, audience segment providers, data exchanges, analytics providers, and other similar providers. Please see the chart at the end of this policy for a current list of the agencies and providers with which we work. These partners and vendors may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited at Company sites and other third party sites) in order to help Company (and in some cases, third party advertisers) deliver personalized content and advertising to you while you are on Company or other sites.</p>
			
        <p>For example, if you go to a Company site to look at one of our Products, you may later see an advertisement from us when you visit another web site. We may also engage one of these vendors to deliver our advertisements to consumers whose online behaviors on sites other than the Company sites indicate that they may be interested in travel. In other instances, we engage in special arrangements with certain advertisers with which we think our web site visitors would have an interest. We allow these advertisers to deliver co-branded messages (e.g., Company and the advertiser) directly to consumers who have visited our web pages. These types of cobranded advertisements may appear on Company sites or on third party sites.</p>
			
        <p>Your browser or other third party mechanisms may be able to allow you to signal or otherwise express your choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals).

          SITES:</strong><br>
          The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access or use our Service, the third-party site or application may send PII about you to us. If so, we will then treat it as PII under this Privacy Statement, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service. In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Statement. Company may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service.</p>
			
        <p>In order to anticipate your needs, Company provides links to other web sites for your convenience and information. Company is not responsible or liable for any content presented by or contained on any independent web site, including, but not limited to, any advertising claims or marketing practices. Please note that while Company will take reasonable steps to protect your information on Company owned and operated web sites, we cannot control and will not be responsible for the privacy policies of third party web sites, including web sites owned or controlled by independent distributors that may use the name of a Company brand, or web sites or mobile applications not controlled or authorized by Company. Third party web sites that are accessed through links on our web sites have separate privacy and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their web sites. We encourage you to contact them to ask questions about their privacy practices, policies and security measures before disclosing any PII. We recommend that you review the privacy statements and policies of linked web sites to understand how those web sites collect, use and store information.</p>
	    
	    <p>Please note that the personal data collected will not be transferred to third parties unless otherwise stated. We will inform you in each case separately about the transfer of personal data to third parties. </p>
			
        <p><strong>MINORS</strong><br>
         We are a general audience service and do not use the Service to knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen (13) that requires parental notice and consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) or other applicable law, without such parental consent. Company does not seek to obtain nor does it wish to receive PII directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our web sites. In the event that Company becomes aware that we have collected personal information from any child (as defined by applicable law), we will dispose of that information in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information without COPPA-required consent, we encourage the parent or guardian to contact us to have this information removed and to unsubscribe the minor from future Company marketing communications. If you are a child under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to use the Service and should not send any information about yourself to us through the Service.</p>
	     
	     <p>For purpose of the GDPR and within its territorial scope (i.e. EU and EEA), please note that:<br>
         In case the consent has given in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.

<p>オンキヨーグループおよびその第三者マーケティング・パートナーは、お客様が弊社の本サービスを利用中に、クッキー、不可視ピクセル、およびウェブビーコン（以下総称して「トラッキング・テクノロジー」）を使用してお客様に関する情報を収集することがあります。クッキーは任意のウェブサーバーからお客様のブラウザに送られてくるきわめて小さなテキストファイルで、お客様のAVレシーバーのハードドライブ内に保存されます。オンキヨーグループ・クッキーはお客様のAVレシーバーに固有の識別子を割り当てますが、この識別子はお客様がオンキヨーグループ・ウェブサイトに戻るごとに、常にお客様のIDカードとして使われます。</p>
<p>クッキーはお客様の時間の節約を目的としています。クッキーによって、お客様は弊社ウェブページに戻るたびにご自分の内容を弊社に伝えることなく、お客様に合わせた独自の体験を得ることができます。オンキヨー・クッキーはお客様のファイルを破損することを意図するものではなく、またお客様のAVレシーバー・ハードドライブ上にある他のファイルから情報を読み取ることもできません。</p>
<p>クッキーを使うことで、弊社は以下のように、個々のお客様に適したオンラインサービスを提供することもできます。<br>

クッキーによって、お客様は必要なすべての情報を得ることができます。<br>
クッキーによって、弊社はお客様の好みと場所に対応する関連情報をお伝えすることができます。</p>

<strong><em>機能</em></strong>&nbsp; 弊社は、お客様が本サービスにアクセスする際に強化機能を提供するため、必要なクッキーまたはその他のトラッキング・テクノロジーを使用することがあります。これらには、お客様が弊社の本サービスにサインインする際の本人確認、または弊社の本サービス上でのコンテンツの提供条件等、弊社が特に選ぶ項目の追跡などが含まれます。<br>
  <strong><em>目標</em></strong>&nbsp; 弊社は、お客様が弊社の広告またはコンテンツにアクセスする程度により、弊社の本サービス上および第三者サイト上で、お客様の興味に合わせた広告などのコンテンツを配信するため、トラッキング・テクノロジーを使用することがあります。これには、お客様に配信された広告およびコンテンツのお客様にとっての有用性を理解するための、トラッキング・テクノロジーの使用が含まれます。</p>
        
<p>弊社はお客様のニーズをよりよく満たすため、また、お客様が今後より容易に情報を見つけだすことができるよう、弊社のウェブサイトの利用状況を追跡します。オンキヨーグループ・クッキーの他に、様々な第三者もお客様のデバイス上にトラッキング・テクノロジーを設定することがあることにご注意ください。これらには第三者ウェブサイトまたはオンラインサービス上で行われるお客様のオンライン活動に関する情報の継続的収集が含まれます。オンキヨーグループはこれらの第三者トラッキング・テクノロジーを制御することはできず、また、第三者トラッキング・テクノロジーの存在の有無について、また、第三者クッキーの関連で第三者が用いる技術能力または方法について責任を負いません。ただし、お客様は弊社の本サービスの利用にあたり、第三者トラッキング・テクノロジーに遭遇する可能性のあることに同意し、また、本プライバシーポリシー中の弊社の声明は第三者のトラッキング・テクノロジーまたは方法には適用されないことに同意します。</p>
<p>お客様がクッキーの使用を希望しない場合は、お客様はクッキーを異なる方法で処理するようお客様のインターネットブラウザを調整することができます。お客様がご使用のブラウザの種類によりますが、お客様は以下のいずれかの方法でお客様のブラウザを設定することができます。（i）毎回、クッキーを認めるか拒否するかを選ぶプロンプトが表示されるか、または、（ii）お客様が、すべてのクッキーの受け入れを阻止するようブラウザを設定します。お客様にはクッキーセキュリティに関する詳細について、お客様のウェブブラウザのサプライヤまたはメーカーにお問い合わせすることをお勧めします。ただし、クッキーを拒否した場合は、それが、弊社のウェブサイト上で特定の取引を行うお客様の能力、およびアクセスのたびにお客様のブラウザを認識する弊社の能力に影響を与える可能性のあることもご理解ください。お客様が使用する各ブラウザは個別に設定する必要があり、また、この点に関しては、ブラウザが提供する機能およびオプションは様々です。</p>
<p>ブラウザを使用しない場合（本アプリケーションのほとんどの機能が含まれます）のアプリケーション関連トラッキング・テクノロジーは、アプリケーションをアンインストールすることでのみ無効にすることができます。アプリケーションをアンインストールする場合は、お客様のオペレーティング・システムまたハンドセットのメーカーの指示に従ってください。</p>
<p>オンキヨーグループはまた、特定のウェブページの閲覧者数を数えるため、ウェブビーコンとも呼ばれる不可視ピクセルを使用することがあります。不可視ピクセルから収集された情報はまとめて使用され報告されますが、PIIは含んでおりません。オンキヨーグループはマーケティング用プログラムおよびコンテンツを改良する目的で、この情報を使用することがあります。</p>
<p><strong>第三者追跡および追跡の禁止</strong><br>
弊社はまた、ベンダーおよびマーケティング・パートナーと協力し、お客様が興味をもつと弊社が考える広告および個人化されたコンテンツを配信します。これらのベンダーおよびその他のパートナーには広告主、広告代理店、広告ネットワーク、視聴者セグメンテーション・プロバイダー、データ交換プロバイダー、分析プロバイダー、およびその他類似のプロバイダーが含まれます。この方針の末尾に、弊社と協働する政府機関およびプロバイダーの最新のリストを掲げますのでご覧下さい。これらのパートナーおよびベンダーはお客様がオンキヨーまたはその他のサイトを閲覧中にオンキヨーグループ（また、ときには第三者広告主）が個人化されたコンテンツおよび広告をお客様に配信するのを支援する目的で、トラッキング・テクノロジーを使用して、お客様のオンライン活動（オンキヨーグループ・サイトおよびその他の第三者サイト上でお客様が閲覧したサイトおよびページなど）に関する情報を収集することがあります。</p>
<p>例えば、お客様が弊社の本製品を見るためにオンキヨーグループ・サイトにアクセスすると、その後お客様が別のサイトにアクセスした際に、弊社からの広告が出ることがあります。また、弊社と契約するこれらのベンダーの1社が、消費者がオンキヨーグループ・サイト以外のサイトでのオンライン行動で旅行に興味があることが分かると、そうした消費者に弊社の広告を配信することがあります。また、別の例として、弊社は、弊社ウェブサイトへの訪問者が興味をもつと弊社が判断した特定の広告主と特別な契約を結ぶことがあります。弊社はこれらの広告主に対して、共同で（オンキヨーグループと広告主との）社名を載せたメッセージを、弊社のウェブページにアクセスした消費者へ直接配信することを認めることがあります。これらの共同社名広告はオンキヨーグループ・サイトまたは第三者サイトに掲載されることがあります。</p>
<p>お客様のブラウザまたはその他の第三者のプログラムにより、お客様は第三者ウェブサイトまたはオンラインサービス上で継続的にお客様のオンライン活動に関する情報が収集されることについて、お客様の選択を知らせるか、別の方法により明確にすることができます（ブラウザは信号を追跡しません）。現在、弊社はこれら「追跡禁止」信号その他のプログラムに関しては監視や対策を実施していません。</p>
