In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to transfer your PII to Company's affiliates, properties within the Company system and/or third party service providers located in Japan and throughout the world for the purposes outlined within this Privacy Statement. Unless otherwise precluded or governed by legal requirements and/or process, Company, its subsidiaries and its affiliates that may receive your information are required to abide by substantially similar privacy requirements relating to your PII. As a general practice, Company does not sell, rent, or give physical possession of your PII to unaffiliated third parties outside the Company system. For international transfer of personal data, we apply the standards of GDPR as described below under “DATA TRANSFERS ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS".

If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your PII and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.

However, if you reside outside of Japan, certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission before we send you information that you have not requested from us.

Such cases may be the use of the Products and services as well as the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken. In addition, your permission will be deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill transactions and services that you request. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements, and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.

We may transfer the PII we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected.

**ON-LINE TECHNOLOGIES**  
We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies (as defined below) and your limited choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed.

Company and its third party marketing partners may use cookies, invisible pixels, and web beacons to obtain information about you while visiting our Services (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”). A cookie is a very small text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your AV receiver's hard drive. Company cookies assign your AV receiver with a unique identifier, which in turn, becomes your identification card whenever you return to an Company web site.

Cookies are designed to save you time because they help us to provide you with a customized experience without you having to remind us of your preferences each time you return to our web pages. Company cookies are not designed to damage your files, nor can they read information from other files on your AV receiver hard drive.

Cookies can also help us provide you with a personalized on-line experience in the following ways:  
they remember your user name and password for future visits so log-in is easier and faster;  
they ensure you are provided with the appropriate frames and content.  
they ensure you obtain all requested information; and  
they help us deliver communications that are relevant and responsive to your interests and location. 

**Tracking Technologies Usage**.  We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:  
**_Strictly Necessary_**. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Service, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.  
**_Performance‑Related_**. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Service, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.

This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that have been delivered to you.

We track the usage of our web sites in order to better meet your needs and to help make it easier for you to find information in the future. Please note that in addition to Company cookies, various third parties may also place Tracking Technologies on your Device, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. Company may not control these third party Tracking Technologies, and is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party Tracking Technologies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies. However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Service and accept that our statements under this Privacy Statement do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.

If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your Internet browser can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security. However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our web sites and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.

App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of the App) can only be disabled by uninstalling the App. To uninstall an App, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.

Company also uses invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, to count how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain PII. Company may use this information to improve marketing programs and content.

**THIRD PARTY TRACKING AND DO NOT TRACK**  
We may also work with vendors and marketing partners to help deliver advertisements and personalized content that we believe will be of interest to you. These vendors and other partners include advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, audience segment providers, data exchanges, analytics providers, and other similar providers. Please see the chart at the end of this policy for a current list of the agencies and providers with which we work. These partners and vendors may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited at Company sites and other third party sites) in order to help Company (and in some cases, third party advertisers) deliver personalized content and advertising to you while you are on Company or other sites.

For example, if you go to a Company site to look at one of our Products, you may later see an advertisement from us when you visit another web site. We may also engage one of these vendors to deliver our advertisements to consumers whose online behaviors on sites other than the Company sites indicate that they may be interested in travel. In other instances, we engage in special arrangements with certain advertisers with which we think our web site visitors would have an interest. We allow these advertisers to deliver co-branded messages (e.g., Company and the advertiser) directly to consumers who have visited our web pages. These types of cobranded advertisements may appear on Company sites or on third party sites.

Your browser or other third party mechanisms may be able to allow you to signal or otherwise express your choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these “do not track” signals or other mechanisms..

**INTERACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES:**  
The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access or use our Service, the third-party site or application may send PII about you to us. If so, we will then treat it as PII under this Privacy Statement, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service. In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Statement. Company may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service.

In order to anticipate your needs, Company provides links to other web sites for your convenience and information. Company is not responsible or liable for any content presented by or contained on any independent web site, including, but not limited to, any advertising claims or marketing practices. Please note that while Company will take reasonable steps to protect your information on Company owned and operated web sites, we cannot control and will not be responsible for the privacy policies of third party web sites, including web sites owned or controlled by independent distributors that may use the name of a Company brand, or web sites or mobile applications not controlled or authorized by Company. Third party web sites that are accessed through links on our web sites have separate privacy and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their web sites. We encourage you to contact them to ask questions about their privacy practices, policies and security measures before disclosing any PII. We recommend that you review the privacy statements and policies of linked web sites to understand how those web sites collect, use and store information.

Please note that the personal data collected will not be transferred to third parties unless otherwise stated. We will inform you in each case separately about the transfer of personal data to third parties. 

**MINORS**  
We are a general audience service and do not use the Service to knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen (13) that requires parental notice and consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) or other applicable law, without such parental consent. Company does not seek to obtain nor does it wish to receive PII directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our web sites. In the event that Company becomes aware that we have collected personal information from any child (as defined by applicable law), we will dispose of that information in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information without COPPA-required consent, we encourage the parent or guardian to contact us to have this information removed and to unsubscribe the minor from future Company marketing communications. If you are a child under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to use the Service and should not send any information about yourself to us through the Service.

For purpose of the GDPR and within its territorial scope (i.e. EU and EEA), please note that:  
In case the consent has given in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
