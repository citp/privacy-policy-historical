ONLYJOBLISTINGS DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.

The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of ONLYJOBLISTINGS

This policy applies to ONLYJOBLISTINGS's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by ONLYJOBLISTINGS on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to ONLYJOBLISTINGS's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. ONLYJOBLISTINGS is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.

**1\. Collection of Information.**

**1.1 Survey Information.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an ONLYJOBLISTINGS survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, ONLYJOBLISTINGS or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to ONLYJOBLISTINGS, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). ONLYJOBLISTINGS may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to ONLYJOBLISTINGS or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from ONLYJOBLISTINGS or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to ONLYJOBLISTINGS.

**1.2 Third Party List Information.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and ONLYJOBLISTINGS subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, ONLYJOBLISTINGS seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to ONLYJOBLISTINGS and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.

**1.3 Other Information.**

Other occasions when ONLYJOBLISTINGS obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by ONLYJOBLISTINGS or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through ONLYJOBLISTINGS's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a ONLYJOBLISTINGS service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

**1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, ONLYJOBLISTINGS may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

**(a) Cookies.**

A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows ONLYJOBLISTINGS to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in ONLYJOBLISTINGS's database. You may read more about cookies at [http://cookiecentral.com](http://cookiecentral.com/). Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.

**(b) Web Beacons.**

A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an <img src="x"> programming function -- see [http://truste.org](http://truste.org/) for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows ONLYJOBLISTINGS to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, ONLYJOBLISTINGS might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in ONLYJOBLISTINGS's database, visits the fishing website, ONLYJOBLISTINGS receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site, and ONLYJOBLISTINGS would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in fishing. ONLYJOBLISTINGS may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, ONLYJOBLISTINGS also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in ONLYJOBLISTINGS's database.

**(c) New Technology.**

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is ONLYJOBLISTINGS's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, ONLYJOBLISTINGS strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

**1.5 Outside Information.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of ONLYJOBLISTINGS including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").

**1.6 Individual Information.**

As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information ONLYJOBLISTINGS gathers or receives about individuals.

**1.7 No Information Collected from Children.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If ONLYJOBLISTINGS obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, ONLYJOBLISTINGS has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. ONLYJOBLISTINGS has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

**1.8 Credit Card Information.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from ONLYJOBLISTINGS. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to ONLYJOBLISTINGS, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. ONLYJOBLISTINGS will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.

**2\. Use of Individual Information.**

**2.1 Discretion to Use Information.**

THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.

The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how ONLYJOBLISTINGS currently uses Individual Information, but ONLYJOBLISTINGS may change or broaden its use at any time.

ONLYJOBLISTINGS may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.

**2.2(b) Solicited Email.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from ONLYJOBLISTINGS or to individuals who have agreed on third party websites to receive email from third parties such as ONLYJOBLISTINGS. ONLYJOBLISTINGS does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to ONLYJOBLISTINGS's email messages.

**2.3 Targeted Advertising.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the Internet, ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, and ONLYJOBLISTINGS attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. ONLYJOBLISTINGS may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.

ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.

ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of ONLYJOBLISTINGS's web sites are most frequently visited. This information helps ONLYJOBLISTINGS to better understand the online habits of individuals so that ONLYJOBLISTINGS can target advertising and promotions to them.

**2.6 Profiles of Individuals.**

ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases.

**2.7 Storage of Individual Information**.

ONLYJOBLISTINGS stores the Individual Information in a database on ONLYJOBLISTINGS computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under ONLYJOBLISTINGS's control. Not withstanding such measures, ONLYJOBLISTINGS cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent ONLYJOBLISTINGS computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.

Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Websites and on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about individuals.

Such links are provided for your convenience and reference only.
