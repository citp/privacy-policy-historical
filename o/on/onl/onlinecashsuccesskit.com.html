      <h2 class="mHeading">Cookies and Action Tags</h2>
      <p class="default1">We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using "cookies" and "action tags." </p>
      <p class="default1">"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer in order to identify: (a) your Web browser; (b) your activity  on the Website; and (c) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other marketing and promotional efforts.  Cookies may be used to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> personalize your experience on the Website (e.g., to dynamically generate content on web pages specifically designed for you); </li>
        <li> assist you in using our Online Products (e.g., to save you time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to the Website); and </li>
        <li> allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Website for purposes of improving our Online Products, All-Access Program and other offerings. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="default1">We also may use cookies to conduct marketing and promotional efforts, tailor certain advertisements to your browser that we think may be of interest to you, and to determine the popularity of certain content. </p>
      <p class="default1">You do not have to accept cookies to use the Website, however, you may not be able to use certain products, offerings, features or resources of the Website (including our Online Products and/or the All-Access Program) if you do not accept cookies. Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar.</p>
      <p class="default1">"Action tags," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed.  Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Website, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain cookies that are associated with action tags that are located on the Website.  Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer. </p>
      <p class="default1">By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve the Website and our Online Products and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>
      <p class="default1">Finally, please note that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags that track when you click on their advertisement or link to their website or service, on or from the Website.  This Privacy Policy does not govern the privacy practices of such third-party websites or providers of third-party advertising.</p>
      <h2 class="mHeading">Referral Programs</h2>
      <p class="default1">Through third-party referral program operators and others, we offer referral programs through which websites can earn commissions through the referral of subscribers or other purchasers to the Website. To track the earning of such commissions, and to determine the effectiveness of the referral programs, the users who become subscribers to or purchasers of our Online Products, or enroll in our All-Access Program, through such referral websites are tracked using technologies that do not include Personally Identifiable Information (such as cookies and/or action tags).  Our program operators and the referral websites themselves can only access Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as data relating to the number of impressions served, the number of transactions completed and their resulting earnings. They cannot access our customers' Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
      <p class="default1">Please note that if you choose to apply to be a referral website, we use the data that you provide in connection with the affiliate application process strictly for conducting business with you. </p>

      <p class="default1"> The Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or operated by OnlineCashSuccessKit™ (for example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, you will likely be taken to a third party website), including links to websites operated by franchisees of OnlineCashSuccessKit™.  We will attempt to make it obvious to you when you leave the Website and visit these websites by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving the Website.  However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites.
