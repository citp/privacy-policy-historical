# Online-Education.net Privacy Policy

## Company Practices Regarding Your Privacy

We at Online-Education.net and our affiliated companies worldwide are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any information you share with us by using our web sites.

Online-Education.net has established the following Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes the overall privacy practices of Online-Education.net regarding information we collect on our network of web sites and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but not limited to email, newsletters, and leave-behinds. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Online-Education.net does not own or control, or to people that Online-Education.net does not employ.

## Your California Privacy Rights

California has passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to California residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer's personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information. 

If you are a California resident you may request this information from Online-Education.net or any of its affiliates by writing to us via email at [info@quinstreet.com](mailto:info@quinstreet.com) or you may send us correspondence at the following address: Online-Education.net, Attn: Privacy, 950 Tower Lane, 6th Floor, Foster City, CA 94404. Online-Education.net is not obligated to respond to more than one such request from a customer per calendar year.

## Information Collected by Online-Education.net

_Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information_

Online-Education.net collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs and to provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) or other Internet tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet session may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using, your Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP address and the URL you saw just before coming to the Online-Education.net site, the pages of the site you visited and the URL of the page you visited upon leaving the site.

Online-Education.net may also contract with reputable third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures to collect your non-personally identifiable information.

_Personally Identifiable Consumer Information_

In addition, at some of the Online-Education.net web sites, we collect information that you may choose to provide to us when requesting additional information from us or from one or more of our clients. Examples of personally identifiable data that you may provide to us include name, address, and email address. If you provide personally identifiable data to us, you may later elect to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth below.

## How Collected Information is Used

The non-personally identifiable information that Online-Education.net collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals.

If you elect to provide Online-Education.net with personally identifiable information, we may utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in follow-up communications from Online-Education.net and from our clients. In addition, that information may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to your preferences and behaviors, and for other Online-Education.net sales and marketing efforts.

## Sharing Information with Third Parties

All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence by Online-Education.net. There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below.

Your non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of Online-Education.net on an anonymous basis.

When you request information from Online-Education.net or one or more of our clients, we may transfer that information within Online-Education.net or route your information to our client(s), across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, so that they may provide the information on their product or service that you requested.

We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that Online-Education.net is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business.

In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others, there is also the possibility that Online-Education.net, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable information.

Finally, Online-Education.net may share your information as necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.

## Security

Wherever your personally identifiable information may be held within Online-Education.net or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the information you shared with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Please note that while Online-Education.net will make every reasonable effort to protect your information, no transmission of data over the Internet is 100% secure.
