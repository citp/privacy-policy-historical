<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Company/Seller (herein referred to as "this Site") strives to offer 
its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide 
an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally 
Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, 
telephone number) subject to the terms of this Privacy policy. We will 
never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third
 party. </p>
<p class="redman style1" align="center"><strong>WE HATE SPAM! We will NEVER sell, rent, barter or share your EMAIL ADDRESS with anyone! </strong></p>
<p><strong>How we gather information from users </strong></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the 
services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request 
certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You 
may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and 
contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of 
our site, where applicable. Like most Web sites, this Site may collect 
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that 
may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you
 and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie 
may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to 
re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number
 of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our 
site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information 
through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us 
with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to 
accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain 
portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and 
password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features 
according to your preferences. </p>
<p><strong>What we do with the Information we Collect </strong></p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your 
visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.. </p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify
 you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information 
about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other 
users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages 
are visited most or what features are most attractive). We may 
occasionally provide limited personal information to trustworthy third 
parties for direct mail offers and to make our future marketing efforts 
more efficient, but you can tell us not to. Such information includes 
your name and mailing address or other information where. This 
information may be combined with demographic information and past 
purchase information. We will never include your email address or credit
 card information. </p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on this Site
 to communicate with you about your registration and customization 
preferences; our Terms of Service and Privacy policy; services and 
products offered by this Site and other topics we think you might find 
of interest. </p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by this Site may also 
be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site 
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, 
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications 
with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the 
operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access 
such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law.
 In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, 
we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. 
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred 
assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court 
order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do 
so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to 
us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it 
appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice
 prior to disclosure in such cases. </p>
<p>The use of information as described herein may or may not be how 
information that   is collected is customarily used by this site.&nbsp; 
While actual use of any   information collected may be used quite 
conservatively, you must assume that it   is not.&nbsp; You must assume 
that information collected is shared with other persons   or entities 
for commercial purposes.&nbsp; While this may or may not occur, you must
   assume that it is as you make your decision whether or not to view or
 interact   with this website.&nbsp; This type of shared information may
 include your name,   address, phone number, email address and buying 
habits, as well as other   information.&nbsp; This information may be 
used for general commercial solicitation   by this website or other 
persons it is sold to, rented to, or shared with.</p>

third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited 
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are 
beyond the control of this Site and this policy. </p>

submit whatever   information is demanded by the website in insure that

 provisions of the OPPA may exempt this   website from complying.&nbsp; 
While we take measures to ensure that outside parties   do not have 
access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that   
outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your 
  information.&nbsp; (You should know that merchant service providers do
 not allow us   access to your credit card information.)&nbsp; This 
Privacy Policy also is subject to   change without notice.&nbsp; You are
 required to read it prior to using the website.&nbsp;   By interacting
