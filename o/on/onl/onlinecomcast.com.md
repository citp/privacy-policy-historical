  1. **General**

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you about the type of information that Saveology.com (“Company”, “we,” “our” or “us”) may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of Saveology.com (this “Site”). It also is intended to explain the conditions under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to that information.

  3. **Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information**

We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying Information from you. “Non–Personally–Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. “Personally–Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.

Like most site operators, we gather from you Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages that you view right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.

      2. **_Web Cookies_**

A “ **Web Cookie** ” is a string of information that a site stores on your computer, and that your browser provides to this Site each time you submit a query to this site.

In order to enhance your experience when you visit our website, we participate in the Google Interest-based Advertising Program (the “Program”) to insure that the advertisements on our website correspond to your interests.

      4. **_Web Beacons_**

A “ **Web Beacon** ” is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may occasionally place Web Beacons on pages of this Site.  
You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.

    2. **_Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information_**

We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from you to help us better understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. We link information gathered using Web Cookies and Web Beacons to Personally-Identifying Information.
