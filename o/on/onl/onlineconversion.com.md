**BlueSparks** has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for our web sites.

Some forms may ask users to give us contact information (email address).

**We will never give or sell your email address to anyone.**

**Web Forms**

**OnlineConversion.com:** Many of the forms ask you to enter information for using the conversions. Such as how many feet to convert to meters. Some may ask for personal information, such as your birthday, to tell you how many days old you are. These forms use "Client Side Scripting" and do not send any information to us. The information entered in these forms disappears as soon as you close your web browser. 

**AcronymSearch.com:** The information typed into the acronym search, and reverse acronym search, is sent to our server and may be saved. We would use this information for determining the "most popular" acronym or something similar. We consider this information to be "non-personal" in nature, and can in no way be associated with any single person. 

**Forums**

We use a community type BBS for our Message Forums.

If you post messages as a guest, your name and email address is asked for. This information can be viewed by anyone. Your email address is not required and we recommend not giving it, and using an alias for your name, if you do not wish this information available to the public.

If you register for the message forums, other personal information is asked for. This information is viewable by anyone. Most information is optional and we recommend not giving information you do not want available to the public. Your email address is required but you can make this private in your preferences. Your name is required but you may use an alias if you wish.

Any information you give in the message forums is not used by us. It is used only for the message forum. Some examples are notifying you through email when you request to be notified of postings.

**Chat**

BlueSparks has public chat which asks for your name. Anybody can view this information so BlueSparks recommends using an Alias when using the chat. The chat is for demostration purposes only for those interested in downloading the chat program.

**External Links**

These sites contain links to other sites. **BlueSparks** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Security**

These sites have standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We cannot be 100% sure that nobody can hack into our server, so BlueSparks recommends using a free e-mail service, such as hotmail, when submitting your e-mail address to sites on the Internet.
