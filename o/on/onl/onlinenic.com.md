    DOMAIN REGISTRATION SERVICES PRIVACY POLICY ADDENDUM

“Privacy Policy”), is applicable to you if you purchased domain registration services from
OnlineNIC Inc (“we,” “us” or “OnlineNIC”). Please review the below in addition to the Privacy
Policy.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
When you purchase Domain Registration services for top level domains (“TLDs”), as the
domain registrar, we are required to collect the following personal information from you
(collectively, “Personal Information”):
            Registrant Name

            Billing Contact Email
            Billing Contact Fax (where applicable)
            Billing Contact Telephone Number
Our collection of Personal Information is necessary to comply with contractual obligations we
have with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) and with
certain TLD registries (“Registries”) so that you can validly register your domain name. In
addition to Personal Information, our contracts with some Registries may require us to collect


other personal information for the registration of a TLD such as certain professional affiliations,
identification or other qualifiers (“Additional Personal Information”).
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
        Public Whois. Our contracts with ICANN and other Registries require us to make
         certain domain name information (“WHOIS Information”) available and accessible to
         the public through a searchable port 43 “WHOIS” Service via a public webpage
         operated by the applicable registrar of record (“WHOIS site”). The WHOIS site is a
         publicly accessible database that lists WHOIS Information, including a particular
         domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain
         name’s creation and expiration date. Except for EU/EEA natural persons (as described
         below), your Personal Information could be displayed on the WHOIS site.
        EU/EEA natural persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the European
         Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, if you are a EU/EEA
         natural person (as defined by the GDPR), other than as specified in this addendum,
         our publication of WHOIS Information will not contain any Personal Information.
         Accordingly, we will not display Personal Information of an EU/EEA natural person on
         the WHOIS site unless you explicitly opt out of this protection.
        Transfer Out. If you initiate a transfer out of a domain name away from us as the
         registrar of record, pursuant to our contract with ICANN, we may need to publish your
         registrant email address obtained from your Personal Information on the WHOIS site
         for a period of approximately five (5) calendar days. After this period and assuming a
         valid transfer has occurred, you would cease to be our customer for that domain name
         and your WHOIS Information would be managed by the gaining registrar.
        Certain Registries. Registries are third party providers of TLDs that are independent
         of domain registrars. If required by contract with a particular Registry, we may be
         obligated, as a domain registrar of domains provided by the Registry, to provide
         Personal Information and Additional Personal Information to such Registry to
         successfully complete your domain name registration. If we provide your Personal
         Information and Additional Personal Information to a Registry, the Registry has its own
         obligation to comply with applicable data privacy laws.
        Data Escrow. Our contract with ICANN requires us to deposit the Personal
         Information collected with a secure third-party escrow provider who acts solely as a
         holder of the data.
        Permitted Disclosures. We may also disclose your Personal Information when
         required by the rules, regulations and policies of ICANN, including but not limited to
         the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP).
