They may also combine information they collect from your interaction with the Site with information they collect from other sources. We do not have access to, or control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies.
  

    3. **Information Collected From Other Sources**

We may acquire information from other sources as follows:

      * From other trusted third-party sources to update or supplement the information that you provide or that we collect automatically. This includes, for example, information from public databases or data aggregators (which may include your demographic information, previous purchases, lifestyle preferences, or information to validate or update the information we collect from or about you).
      * From our partners and service providers (including, for example, business partners, analytics vendors, advertising networks and search information providers).

We may use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, personalize your experience with the Services, target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services or other offers that may be of interest to you, to measure ad quality and responses, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

    4. **Combination of Information**

We may combine the information we receive from and about you, including information you provide to us and information we automatically collect through our Services, as well as information collected offline, across other computers or devices that you may use, or from third party sources.

  2. **HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**
  

    1. **Information Use by or on Behalf of Us**

We may use the information we collect from or about you to:

      * Confirm, process, or otherwise complete a transaction or transactions requested by you;
      * Provide customer support (including, responding to your requests), troubleshoot and resolve problems and disputes;

      * Understand and anticipate your needs and preferences;

Additionally, if you use the Services to connect with third party services you authorize us to use information from and about you, on your behalf, to interact with these third party services based on your requests.

    2. **How We Use Your Information for Interest-Based Advertising**

We may use third parties to measure and target advertisements on our behalf about our products and services that are tailored to your online interests. We allow these third-party companies to use cookies, web beacons, pixels and similar technologies to collect certain data and other information about your online activity. This information is used to display advertisements for us on the Site or across other websites, mobile applications, social media or online services that you use, or to send you promotional materials or offers via email or direct mail.

We also may display interest-based ads through Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms or websites. This is done through the Facebook Custom Audiences, Twitter Tailor Audiences, or other similar business tools. These tools allow us to personalize our ads based on your shopping experience with us, without having to share your personal information with these social media platforms. We do this only by sharing hashed information (which converts your email or phone number to a unique string of numbers and letters) that the social media platform then matches data against its own data for the limited purpose of serving advertisements (either directly to you or to other lookalike audiences). The matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted, and are not used for any other purpose.

For information on your choices with respect to interest-based ads, see the "Interest Based Advertising Choices" section below.

  3. **DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION**
  

    1. **Information You Disclose to Third Parties**
