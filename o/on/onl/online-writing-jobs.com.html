			 <div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px"> 
				<p>Online-Writing-Jobs.com strives to offer its visitors the many
				  advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
				  personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your
				  name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of
				  this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to
				  any unauthorized third party. Period.</p> 
				<p><b>How we gather information from users</b></p> 
				<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
				  visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services
				  provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you
				  register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain
				  features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide
				  information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards
				  and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,
				  Online-Writing-Jobs.com also collects information automatically and through the
				  use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example,
				  we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology
				  to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the
				  cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to
				  re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of
				  times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we
				  adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other
				  means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
				  example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you
				  may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to
				  re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the
				  site's features according to your preferences.<br><br>We automatically register
				  your I.P. address in case of spam and abuses to our jobbank. Any user caught
				  spamming or abusing our jobbank will be banned indefinitely and we will report
				  you to your Internet Service Provider with your I.P. address.</p> 
				<p><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p> 
				<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance
				  your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect
				  your privacy and do not share your information with anyone. All passwords are
				  encrypted and even our webmasters cannot access your password without
				  generating a new one for you.</p> 
				<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
				  identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information
				  about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to
				  help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most
				  or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally
				  be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information
				  does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow
				  anyone to identify you individually.</p> 
				<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
				  www.Online-Writing-Jobs.com to communicate with you about your registration and
				  customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services
				  and products offered by www.Online-Writing-Jobs.com and other topics we think
				  you might find of interest.</p> 
				<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by
				  Online-Writing-Jobs.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not
				  limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce
				  transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other
				  communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support
				  for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access
				  such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In
				  addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may
				  sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
				  transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also
				  disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we
				  believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the
				  collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities
				  whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide
				  you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p> 
				<p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p> 
				<p>Online-Writing-Jobs.com expects its partners, advertisers and
				  affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third
				  parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content
				  providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
				  collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site
				  you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a www.Online-Writing-Jobs.com
				  page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.
				  Also, through Online-Writing-Jobs.com you may be introduced to, or be able to
				  access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by
				  other parties. Online-Writing-Jobs.com is not responsible for the actions or
				  policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy
				  policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page
				  operated by a third party.</p> 
				<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or
				  other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify
				  some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some
				  of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that
				  enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular
				  advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services
				  operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather
				  information. Online-Writing-Jobs.com does not control the use of this
				  technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not
				  responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p> 
				<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
				  Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
				  information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third
				  parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
				  individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
				  Online-Writing-Jobs.com and this policy. </p> 
				<p><b>Children</b></p> 
				<p>Online-Writing-Jobs.com does not knowingly collect or solicit
				  Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as
				  permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child
				  under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information
				  immediately. If you believe Online-Writing-Jobs.com has any information from or
				  about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p> 
				<p><b>Contacting Us</b></p>

				<p><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p> 
				<p>Online-Writing-Jobs.com reserves the right to change this policy
				  at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued
				  use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you
				  accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is
				  posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time
				  the information was collected.</p> 
				<p><b>Governing law</b></p> 
				<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by South
				  Carolina law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to
				  resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following
				  location: Columbia. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with
				  the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p> 
				<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory
				  solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding
				  arbitration at the following location: Columbia, under the rules of the
				  American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
				  arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p> 
				<p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended
				  to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of
