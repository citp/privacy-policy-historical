# Privacy policy | BOS online survey tool

This document explains what information we gather when you visit the BOS website (https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk) and explains how that information may be used.

The information within this document does not apply to any surveys run using the BOS software. Specifically, it is the sole responsibility of the institution holding the BOS licence to provide survey respondents with all appropriate information as required either by law or by other statute (such as instruction from an ethics committee) either as part of the survey completion process or via other communication.

In addition, registered users of the BOS service should refer to the licence agreement signed by their organisation.

## Email address use

You will need to provide a valid and operational email address should you wish to log in to BOS (either to run surveys or access survey results etc). This address may be visible on any surveys you issue and will be used if you request a replacement password.

Administrators and the Primary Contact within the BOS account may be added to our [mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=BOS-SURVEYS) since this is the primary means of communication between the BOS team and our registered users. Users may choose to leave this mailing list at any time.

Your email address will not be passed to any third party except if required by law or in the case of a user abusing the Bristol Online Surveys service – in which case details will be passed to contacts at the relevant institution or service provider.

## Data collected

As with the vast majority of web sites, our web server automatically logs certain information about every request made of it. This information is used for system administration, for bug tracking, and for producing usage statistics.

Data may, on occasion, be passed to the administrators of other computer systems/networks to enable investigation of abuse, problems accessing this site or of system misconfiguration. Otherwise the logged information is not passed to any third party except if required by law. Summary statistics are extracted from this data and some of these may be made publicly available, but those that are do not include information from which individuals could be identified.

The following data is automatically logged for each request:

  * The name or network address of the computer making the request. Note that under some (but not all) circumstances it may be possible to infer from this the identity of the person making the request. Note also that the data recorded may be that of a web proxy rather than that of the originating client.
  * The date and time of connection.
  * The HTTP request, which contains the identification of the document requested.
  * The status code of the request (success or failure etc.).
  * The number of data bytes sent in response.
  * The contents of the HTTP Referrer header supplied by the browser.
  * The content of the HTTP User-Agent header supplied by the browser.
  * Logging of additional data may be enabled temporarily from time to time for specific purposes.
