		<h1 class="title">Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>Last Modified: May 2018</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<br>
		<p>Only Fans is a social network which enables some users to share their content; other users to enjoy others’ content and for some to do both.</p>
		<p>Only Fans is the trading name of Fenix International Limited (company number 10354575).</p>
		<p>When people use these services they share some information with us. This policy sets out the information we collect, how we use it and who we share it with.</p>
		<p>We confirm that the lawful basis for processing your data is that by participating with our social network you have contracted with us (INSERT TERMS OF SERVICE LINK) and the processing of data set out here is part of that contract. To the extent that we have to monitor and control use of our site the basis for that processing is to fulfil a legal obligation</p>
		<p>If you have any questions about anything in our Privacy Policy or wish to complain then please contact
			<a href="mailto:privacy@onlyfans.com">privacy@onlyfans.com</a>. We hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information. If not, contact the Information Commissioner at
			<a href="http://ico.org.uk/concerns/">https://ico.org.uk/concerns/</a> or telephone: 0303 123 1113 for further information about your rights and how to make a formal complaint.
		</p>
