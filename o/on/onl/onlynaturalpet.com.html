<p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>We only collect personally identifiable information from you when you voluntarily 
	register on the site, place an order, request a catalog, enter a contest or 
	sweepstakes, respond to a survey or communication such as e-mail, or participate 
	in another site feature. </li>
	<li>When ordering or registering, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, 
	mailing address, phone number, credit card information or other information. 
	You may, however, visit our site anonymously. </li>
	<li>We may also collect information about gift recipients such as name, 
	email address, and shipping address so that we can fulfill 
	the gift purchase. The information we collect about gift recipients is used 
	for purposes of sending the gift and will not be used 
	for other purposes. </li>
	<li>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enhance your experience and gather 
	information about visitors and visits to our websites. Please refer to the "Do 
	we use 'cookies'?" section below for information about cookies and how we use 
	them.</li>
	<li>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our 
	site, we will ask you for you and your friends name and email address. We 
	will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to 
	visit the site. We do not store this information, and use it for the sole 
	purpose of sending this one-time email.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How do we use your information?</strong><br>
<br>
We may use the information we collect from you when you register, purchase products, 
enter a contest or promotion, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf 
the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:
<ul>
	<li>To personalize your site experience and to allow us to deliver the type 
	of content and product offerings in which you are most interested. </li>
	<li>To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service 
	requests. </li>
	<li>To quickly process your transactions. </li>
	<li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature. </li>
	<li>If you have opted-in to receive our e-mail newsletter, we may send you periodic 
	e-mails. If you would no longer like to receive promotional e-mail from us, 
	please refer to the "How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have 
	provided to us?" section below. If you have not opted-in to receive e-mail newsletters, 
	you will not receive these e-mails. Visitors who register or participate in 
	other site features such as marketing programs and 'members-only' content will 
	be given a choice whether they would like to be on our e-mail list and receive 
	e-mail communications from us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do we use "cookies"?</strong><br>
<br>
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your 
computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's 
or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember 
certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process 
the items in your shopping cart, greet you by name, and facilitate signing into 
your account. They are also used to help us understand your preferences 
based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with 
improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site 
traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools 
in the future. These cookies do not contain personally identifiable information 
and the information collected is not tied to your personally identifiable 
information except to provide the services described here.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our website. We have no access 
to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of 
cookies by this website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any 
advertisers.<br>
<br>
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, 
or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like 
Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, 
so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. 
If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site 
experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. However, 
you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service at 
888-937-6677.<br>
<br>
<strong>Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</strong><br>
<br>
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally 
identifiable information except as outlined below. The term "outside parties" 
does not include Only Natural Pet Store.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We use other third parties to provide services such as email delivery, 
	website hosting, credit card processing, and catalog mailing. When you sign 
	up for our email newsletter, place an order, or request a catalog, we will 
	share your information as necessary for the third party to provide that 
	service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally 
	identifiable information for any other purpose.</li>
	<li>We may release your information when we believe release is appropriate to 
	comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, 
	property, or safety. </li>
	<li>We may release your name, mailing address, and purchase history to certain 
	outside parties to be used for anonymous marketing analysis or to send you postal 
	mail offers from other companies we believe you may be interested in receiving. 
	You may opt-out of this marketing analysis and of receiving postal mail offers 
	from outside parties by sending a request to
	<a href="mailto:service@onlynaturalpet.com">service@onlynaturalpet.com</a> or 
	calling us at 888-937-6677.</li>
	<li>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any 
	third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an 
	informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that 
	party.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your email address will not be sold, rented, or traded to an outside party. You 
will not receive email from an outside party as a result of providing your email 
address to us.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<strong>How can you opt-out, deactivate, or modify information you have provided to us?</strong><br>

communication with a link that will take you to this page. Please note that due to email production schedules

sign into your account and update it. You may also update your information, or 
if you no longer desire our service, deactivate it, by contacting us at

<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter 
sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or 
order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 
information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No 
method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 
100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable 
means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute 
security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can email 
us at <a href="mailto:service@onlynaturalpet.com">service@onlynaturalpet.com</a>.</p>

on our site. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. 
We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities 
of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site 
and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link 
does not work).</p>
