Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual. 

**What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?**

> We may collect basic user profile information from our Visitors. Online-Sweepstakes.com may collect Personally Identifiable Information when a Visitor (1) registers as a Member of the website, (2) enters a Sweepstakes and/or Contest administered and/or sponsored by Online-Sweepstakes.com, or (3) subscribes to our newsletter(s). Some of the Personally Identifiable Information we may collect includes names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. 

**How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?**

> We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, contact winners of our Sweepstakes and Contests, or send out our newsletter(s). We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact our Visitors in response to specific inquiries, to provide requested information, or to provide our Visitors with information regarding our Site which we feel is important enough to warrant such contact. 

**With whom may the information may be shared?**

> Online-Sweepstakes.com does not and will not sell or share Personally Identifiable Information about our Visitors with third parties unless explicitly authorized by the Visitor to do so. For example, a Visitor's contact information may be shared with sponsors of our Sweepstakes and/or Contests in order to contact the winner and arrange prize fulfillment. Or, a Visitor's contact information may be shared with a third party when a Visitor "Opts-In" to receive an offer from said third party. Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this information.

> We provide Visitors with a mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting webmaster@online-sweepstakes.com.
