Cookies: 

Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilises a standard technology called "cookies" and web server log files to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs allow us to monitor website traffic and to personalize the content of the site for you. 

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. 

IP Addresses: 

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. 

Security and data retention: 

We employ security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorized persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage. We will retain your information for as long as required or as long as the law requires. 

Accessing and updating your information: 

You are entitled to see the personal information that we have collected on line and that we maintain. If you wish to do this, please contact us by emailing admin[at]online-business-journey.com and insert "access request" as the subject heading. We may charge a small fee to meet our costs in providing you with these details. 

You may ask us to make changes to the information held about you, to ensure that it is accurate and kept up to date. You may also request that we cease processing the personal information and that we delete this from our database or records. Please note that it may be impossible to completely delete your information because of back-ups and records of deletions. Please send your requests to admin[at]online-business-journey.com and insert "change details" or "unsubscribe" as the appropriate subject heading. 

We will only perform the activities outlined above to the extent that such activities will not compromise privacy, security or any other legal interests.
