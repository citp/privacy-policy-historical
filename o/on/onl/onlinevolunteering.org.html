			  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			  <p>       <strong>Overview </strong></p>				
			  <p>UNV is committed to respecting the privacy of its Users. and to providing
			    a safe, secure User experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the
			    online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to
			    the Online Volunteering site (www.onlinevolunteering.org) (the “Site”).
			    By using this Site, you consent to the policies and practices described
			    in this Statement.</p>
			  <p>Our Site contains links to other websites over which we have no control.
			    UNV is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other
			    websites to which you choose to link from this Site. We encourage you
			    to review the privacy policies of those other websites so you can understand
			    how they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Statement
			    applies solely to the information we collect on this Site.</p>
			  <p><br>
			    <strong>Collection and Retention of Information</strong></p>
			  <p>In some areas of the Site, and in order to become a registered user of
			    Online Volunteering, UNV requests or may request that you provide personal
			    information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number,
			    contact information, and any other information from which your identity
			    is discernible. In other areas, UNV collects or may collect demographic
			    information that is not unique to you such as your country of residence,
			    age, gender, and employment status. Sometimes we collect or may collect
			    a combination of the two types of information. An example of an area on
			    the Site where we collect personal or combined personal and demographic
			    data is the registration page.</p>
			  <p>We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our
			    Site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover,
			    there is information about your computer hardware and software that may
			    be collected by UNV. This information can include without limitation your
			    IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website
			    addresses.</p>
			  <p>We retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an
			    effort to make your use of our Site more efficient, practical and relevant.
			    Of course, you can correct or update your personal information at any
			    time. Moreover you can withdraw from the UNV’s Online Volunteering
			    service, in which event we will remove your account profile information
			    except for an archival copy, which is not accessible on the Internet.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p><strong>Use of Information by UNV</strong></p>
			  <p>We use the information we gather on the Site, whether personal, demographic,
			    collective or technical, for the purpose of operation and improving the
			    Site, fostering a positive User experience and facilitating the connection
			    of Online Volunteers to Host Organizations (Groups) as set forth in this
			    Privacy Statement. </p>
			  <p>User information, Host Organization information, and assignments are
			    managed as follows:</p>
			  <p>All Registered Users maintain their information at the Member Profile
			    page accessible from the OV area of the site. <br>
			    The Site eliminates automatically Registered Users registered
			    with an invalid email address.</p>
			  <p>Host Organizations as well as Host Organization assignments are published
			    on the Site subject to their approval by the Site Administrator. <br>
			    The Host Organization Owner can modify his/her assignment postings,
			    take assignments offline/online or delete his/her assignment postings. <br>
			    We have an area where you can submit feedback. Any feedback you
			    submit in this area becomes our property, and we can use such feedback
			    in connection with the Site or contact you for further information.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Others</strong></p>
			  <p>We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined
			    personal and demographic information or information about your use of
			    the Site (such as areas you visit or services you access), except that:</p>
			  <p>(a) In case you apply for an online assignment, certain registered Users
			    affiliated with the organization that posted the assignment will be able
			    to access part of your personal profile such as your name, email address,
			    city and country of residence as well as any additional information you
			    may submit with your application.<br>
			    (b) We may disclose such information to companies and individuals
			    we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting
			    our web servers, and analyzing data. These companies and individuals will
			    have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their
			    functions, but they may not share that information with any other third
			    party.<br>
			    (c) We may disclose such information if legally required to do
			    so, subject to our privileges and immunities, if requested to do so by
			    our internal governing and oversight bodies, including Member States,
			    or if necessary in our sole discretion to protect UNV property or rights,
			    prevent a crime or protect the safety of Users or the public.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
			  <p>UNV ‘s Online Volunteering service uses “cookies” to
			    help personalize and maximize your online experience and time online.
			    A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page
			    server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
			    computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only
			    be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
			  <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
			    to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that
			    you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize
			    pages or register, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information
			    (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies,
			    we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized
			    site experience. </p>
			  <p>You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
			    automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
			    settings to decline all cookies, if you prefer. Alternatively, you may
			    be able to modify your browser settings to notify you each time a cookie
			    is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual
			    basis. If you chose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance
			    and negatively impact your experience on the Site.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p><strong>Updating Your Information</strong></p>
			  <p>All Registered Users can correct, update or change their account profile
			    at any time from the Member Profile page accessible from the MyOV area
			    of the site.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
			  <p>UNV ‘s Online Volunteering service has implemented reasonable technical
			    and organization measures designed to secure your personal information
			    from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or
			    disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties
			    will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information
			    for improper purposes.</p>
			  <p>We attempt to limit access to your personal information to relevant Registered
			    Users, but we cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access
			    to it. For example, Users may have retained a copy of your information
			    in their own file system or databases. We are not responsible for the
			    retention, use or privacy of this information in these instances.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Statement</strong></p>
			  <p>If we decide to change our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes
			    here, so that you will always know what information we gather, how we
			    might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it. If at any
			    time, you have questions or concerns about the UNV Privacy Statement,
			    please feel free to email us at info@onlinevolunteering.org.<br>
