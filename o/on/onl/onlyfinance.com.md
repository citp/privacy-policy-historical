# Privacy Policy - Only Finance®

_Please read this Privacy Policy carefully_

You must not use our website or our services if you do not accept our Privacy Policy. Please be aware that once you have used our website or services therein, you will be regarded as having given your consent to this privacy policy.

Leadbay Ltd is committed to ensuring your personal information is protected. This is done in a number of ways:

  * All our data including your personal information is protected by Thawte
  * Servers are securely located and can only be accessed by authorised employees
  * Firewalls are used to block unauthorised traffic
  * All personal information is kept confidential at all times



We will only collect personal information about you as part of our product aggregation service, for example, in order to obtain a quote for car insurance. We may also be required to store details of your transaction(s) or financial information. We will periodically review our procedures so we do not keep your personal information longer than is required.

Once you have used our website or services therein, you will be regarded as having given your consent to us disclosing your personal information to the following parties: 

  * Third party providers whose products or services are listed on the results pages of www.onlyfinance.com for the purposes of obtaining an online quotation for you or comparing different products and services as requested by you;
  * The Financial Services Authority and/or other regulatory/governing bodies for the purposes of compliance monitoring;
  * Other third parties that might be able to offer, either an alternative product in the event that your preferred choice of third party provider does not approve your application or offers a less attractive product or service than you had originally applied for, or simply a product that meets the basic criteria of the type of product for which you have searched on www.onlyfinance.com 



We would like to keep you updated by phone, e-mail or text of other products and services which we feel you may benefit from. For example, we may e-mail you letting you know how you could save money by switching product and services. By submitting your details you consent to us disclosing your personal information to the following parties:

  1. other companies listed in our website; and
  2. our trusted business partners, whose products and services may save you money.



You can ask us to stop passing your information to third parties for marketing purposes at any time, which we will do. Such a request may result in us ceasing to offer the Services to you. 

If you decide to enter into a contract with a third party provider through our website, the information you have provided to us will be held according to that provider's privacy policy. We therefore strongly advise you read their privacy policy before you enter into any binding agreement with them. In no event shall Leadbay Ltd be liable for any use of your personal data by the third party once you have signed a contract with them.

We may at our discretion use cookies on our site. A cookie is a small file that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser.

Please visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) if you want to know more about how cookies work and how they use visitor data.

Please be aware that your personal information rights are protected by Data Protection Act 1998. If you require a copy of all the personal information we hold on you we will be happy to oblige although a small fee may be payable to cover admin and postage costs.

Telephone calls that you make to Leadbay Ltd may be monitored and recorded. We do this so as to help train our advisors and improve the service we provide to you. Monitoring and recording will only ever take place under adequate and prudent supervision.
