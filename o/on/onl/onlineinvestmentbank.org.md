to the Teacher and the Parent, which form requires parental consent prior to submission by anyone under 18 years old, and the obtaining of a submission code by all under 18 years of age.  When _Virtualology ™_ receives an entry for a contest from someone less than 18 years of age, we will send a confirming Email to the parent’s Email address.  When _Virtualology ™_ receives a submission for judging from anyone regardless of age, we will send a confirming Email to the teacher’s Email address, as submissions must be part of a regular or extra credit classroom assignment.

**USES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED**

The following information will appear on submissions and be seen by the site operator and third parties.  It will be used to separate entries from all other entries, to assure that there are not multiple entries from the same person for the exact same contest period, to notify parent and teacher of submittal and if it was a winner.  The Information will also be used to separate categories of entrants into the appropriate class level (example collegiate versus fifth grade)

Parent/Guardian name and address (unless submitter is over 18 years old) Name of Child/ Submitter (unless the teacher makes other arrangements with _Virtualology ™_ to use distinctive screen names, combining school, teacher and class name identifiers) E-mail address of child/submitter and parent (if submitter is under 18) School in which enrolled (or home school) and its address Grade level at time of submission Teacher’s name and email or other contact information at school; Class / Subject; Title of Paper; Date of Birth.

Materials submitted will be reviewed, judged, and winning submittals may be published in total or edited on the web site or URL of the topic where appropriate, and may also be published on the judging or sponsors site through hyper links.  The city and state of the winning submitters school, grade level, school name, class name, assignment and teacher’s names may also be displayed for the period of time thought appropriate by the site operators. The name of the submitter, if over 18 years of age will be published. Submitters’ names under 18 years of age will be published if the submission is not clearly and prominently marked next to the student name “Do Not Publish”, and signed by the parent.  The materials if selected for inclusion at the web site or URL will be viewed and copied by the public, in general.  The editing sponsor noted on the particular web site or URL would be the organization which will view the submissions and the personal information included on it, see the [_Virtualology Submission Form_. ](http://www.virtualology.com/studentsubmission/)

As the editing sponsor will vary but is identified with a hyper link at the page where the submission is targeted, you must go to that site to determine exactly where the information has gone, who will do the actual judging and what criteria will be used.  For example, if the submission would be about Tyrannosaurus Rex, the URL to type on your computer would be tyrannosaurusrex.org.  At that page you will find the current editing sponsor.  By clicking on the area for the editing sponsor, you will be linked to a site hosted by that sponsor which will identify who will do the judging. It is the goal of _Virtualology_ ™ to award approximately 75% of the sites to editing sponsors by September 2002. For more information click on [editing sponsors.](http://virtualology.com/EditingSponsors/)

The general information obtained at any of the _Virtualology_ ™ sites will be used by _Virtualology_ ™ to determine what additional information to include on a particular site or if additional sites should be added.  It will also be used to tailor future enhancements to the sites.

We may also use personal and general information to perform demographic studies.  By doing this, we can improve our sites to meet the needs of our visitors.  Should we merge personal information and general information, we will use reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity of the personal information.

When _Virtualology_ ™  issues a newsletter, _Virtualology_ ™ or a third party mailing out this newsletter will have access to individually identifiable information  but only for those who have sent their personal information and requested the newsletter.

Our third party partners may have useful products or services.  We attempt to limit use of your information to those services/products that we feel would be of benefit to you.  WE MAY PROVIDE YOUR INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION TO THESE PARTIES.  You will be asked to have information about these sent to you.  As of this writing (see date at beginning), the third parties are either entities that are a University, University associated, or Museums.  In the future, this information will available to advertisers and also be sent to other third parties who will have products and services to offer.  We will limit this to exclude what we feel are inappropriate solicitations.

Children under 13 must by United States law have parental consent to provide personal information over the Internet. We have selected 18 years of age to keep all parents/guardians involved in the learning process and encourage their children’s efforts.  Our policy is to require that all persons under 18 years of age provide a parental consent form to enter any submission and to participate in any activity that requires the disclosure of personal information.

The form found at [Parental Consent](http://www.virtualology.com/consent/)  must be completed, signed by the parent or guardian and mailed to:

General information of which _Virtualology_ ™ sites you visit will be tracked for the purpose of determining general interests. 

A one-time request for information will be processed without parental consent.   The material you submit may be seen by various persons.  Those persons my be associated with _Virtualology_ ™ or the editing sponsors.  We may enter the information you send us into our electronic database, to share with our editing sponsors..  Note that Email is not guaranteed to be secure against interception.

Competition and recognition are keys to this site being successful.  While we want to acknowledge the great works of our scholars of all ages, we do not want to collect or disclose any more information than is necessary to administer the activities on these sites.  We do not want to have parents feel uncomfortable.  On the other hand, the international publication of an excellent student paper or artwork at a website deserves recognition.  The site operator is willing to work with teachers and parents to protect children’s privacy through other methods that would promote fairness, competition and recognition.
