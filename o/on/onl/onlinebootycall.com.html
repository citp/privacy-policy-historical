In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." These small files are needed for the <span class="uppercase">onlinebootycall.COM</span> site to operate properly. If your browser is set to reject all cookies, the <span class="uppercase">onlinebootycall.COM</span> website will not function properly.</p>
	<p class="margin-15">When you use <span class="uppercase">onlinebootycall.COM</span>, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, and perform searches.
