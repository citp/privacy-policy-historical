<div class="fck">
	<p>This policy is effective as of March, 15, 2010.</p>
	<p>
	MOBEZE, INC. ("MOBEZE") has created this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") as part of our commitment to helping our users better understand what information we collect about them and what we may do with that information.
	</p>

	<h2>

	</p>
	<h2>
	2. Information We Collect
	</h2>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
	When you register with ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us.
	</p>
	<p>
	When you enter ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM, we collect your IP address, browser type, hardware profile and the address of the pages you request. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." These small files are needed for the ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM site to operate properly. If your browser is set to reject all cookies, the ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM website will not function properly.
	</p>
	<p>
	When you use ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, and perform searches.

	</p>
	<p>
	You post user content on ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM at your own risk. Although we attempt to limit access to ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM members, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or instant message inviting him or her to become a member.

Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@onlinebootycall.com">support@onlinebootycall.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.
