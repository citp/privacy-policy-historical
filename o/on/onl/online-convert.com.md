This means that Google will broadcast advertisements based on the content of our website and not on the interest profile created by you. Therefore, an analysis of your data for the purpose of profiling does not take place here. However, Google also uses cookies and web beacons in the scope of the “contextual-only advertisements” to prevent abuse, compile statistics, and prevent multiple visits.

To do so, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of a user as soon as they visit the website based on different characteristics.

* ## 16\. Header bidding

On our website, we use the java script “prebid.js” from Prebid.org. This is an open source project, which enables us to start bidding requests on advertising platforms for advertising space provided by us.

We provide advertising space on our website (e.g. areas on our website where banners can be displayed), which we would like to offer at the best possible conditions. In order to ensure this, the java script “prebid.js”, which is integrated by us, “asks” our header bidders (cf. below) if they would like to make an offer on our advertising spaces. The header bidder with the best bid wins the bid and the corresponding advertising material (advertisement) is displayed on our website.

The header bidders inquired by us might, in the scope of the bidding process, receive information (including personal data) from you, and set cookies on your device in order to broadcast advertising material and enable the identification of your device.

The legal basis for the processing of personal data as described above is art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. By being able to display advertisements via the so-called header bidding to our users, we finance our offer and are able to continue doing so for you.

* ## 17\. Header Bidder

We use different header bidding services. These are „Criteo“ (<https://www.criteo.com/>), „sovrn“ (<https://www.sovrn.com/>), „OpenX“ (<https://www.openx.com/>), and „AppNexus“ ([https://www.appnexus.com](https://www.appnexus.com/)).

In each case, we are active as “publishers”, thus providing advertising space for others on our website.

The legal basis for the processing of personal data as described above is art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. By being able to display personalized advertising to users, we can optimize our marketing and let it play out in a targeted manner. This is also the purpose of the integration.

Furthermore, Cloudflare offers increased security and can detect and counter attacks on our servers quickly.

We are registered as a participant in the Amazon affiliate program.

After clicking on an advertisement of the Amazon affiliate program on our website, which will redirect to an offer **on an external website, Amazon sets a cookie** on your device which, among others, contains an ID that allows an association for Amazon. That way, it is possible for Amazon to detect that you took notice of the offer and visited the website via our website. Additionally, a potential purchase of the product can be traced and assigned to our affiliate ID. Amazon can detect your device based on this ID and, e.g., display personalized advertisements to you.

Further information on Amazon’s usage of this data can be found here: <https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010>
