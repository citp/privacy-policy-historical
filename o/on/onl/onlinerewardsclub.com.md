Privacy Policy

**CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS**

Should you no longer want to receive offers from a OnlineRewardsClub, you may choose to "unsubscribe" through by using the unsubscribe option within any promotional offer or through the website. In accordance with the CAN-SPAM Act, you will be completely taken off of our email list and you will no longer receive offers from us. If you have registered or submitted PII (Personally Identifiable Information) under multiple email accounts, you must submit separate unsubscribe requests for each account. 

Cookies that we use do not have an "opt-out" option, yet by changing the setting on your internet browser, you still have the option of blocking cookies. Please see your browser’s help function or internet options tab for instructions. 

OnlineRewardsClub uses software and third-party sources to validate the accuracy of PII provided and/or filter suspicious data. You may change, correct or update your information by email by contacting OnlineRewardsClub. Changing or deleting your information or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from the OnlineRewardsClub will change or delete the data only in our database for purposes of transacting future business on our sites and for managing future communications from OnlineRewardsClub. These changes and deletions will not change or delete information already collected as part of a particular transaction.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT: INDIVIDUAL INTERNET CONSUMERS**

**I.         Personally Identifiable Information (PII). **

OnlineRewardsClub sites are designed to offer Internet consumers with a variety of valuable products. When you place an order with an OnlineRewardsClub site, you will be asked to provide your name, address, zip code, email address and billing information. This information is used to process your order and we cannot do so without it. 

The OnlineRewardsClub may use your PII for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site, and to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on the Site. We also may use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business or combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other sources.

Unless you tell us not to, we may use your personal information to contact you about offers or promotions from OnlineRewardsClub and selected third parties we think you would be interested in. 

**II.       Non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII). **

When you visit an OnlineRewardsClub site, we send a cookie and/or gif file ("Cookies") to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser. Cookies are small data files commonly used on the Internet to help optimize and personalize the Internet end user experience and identify repeat visitors to websites. For example, Cookies enable OnlineRewardsClub to track your shopping cart and retrieve your information and preferences when you return to our site.

For each visitor to our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Upon visiting our website, we assign each visitor a unique ID that is used to track visitor traffic patterns within our website. We also collect aggregate and user-specific information on what pages visitors access or visit. We reserve the right to retain all website traffic reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and auditing purposes.

  **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THIRD PARTY INFORMATION & LANGUAGE**

YOU AGREE THAT HOTPRODUCTOUTLET'S LIABILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY HOTPRODUCTOUTLET TO THE EXTENT SUCH CLAIM IS NOT OTHERWISE BARRED BY OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 

You also agree that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose personal data you supply to the OnlineRewardsClub with regard to: (a) the purposes for which such third party's data has been collected; (b) the intended recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data; (c) which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary; and (d) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them. It is the express will of the parties that this agreement and all related documents have been drawn up in English.

**INFORMATION SHARING**

OnlineRewardsClub may use third party vendors to help us operate our business and OnlineRewardsClub sites or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by OnlineRewardsClub. OnlineRewardsClub reserves the right to rent or sell all email addresses and personal information submitted on our site. 

OnlineRewardsClub and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge PII about consumers who have opted-in to receive marketing communications with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information. 

OnlineRewardsClub may share PII (including information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with advertisers, third party marketers, our affiliated entities for their online and/or offline marketing programs or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the OnlineRewardsClub companies. While OnlineRewardsClub strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, OnlineRewardsClub is not responsible for the information practices of clients or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this policy. 

OnlineRewardsClub may release account and any other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of OnlineRewardsClub or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 

**CONSENT AND CHANGES**

OnlineRewardsClub may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by OnlineRewardsClub prior to the effective date of the policy change unless we provide you direct notice and the opportunity to opt-out of such proposed change.

**DATA PROCESSING**

You acknowledge that OnlineRewardsClub operates in the United State and agree to (i) permit OnlineRewardsClub to transmit and use your User information anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to affect the services and transactions provided by this Site; and (ii) that such use OnlineRewardsClub shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Statement and our Terms and Conditions.

**SECURITY**

OnlineRewardsClub employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on OnlineRewardsClub servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. OnlineRewardsClub also encrypts sensitive information such as passwords and financial data. OnlineRewardsClub has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, allowing access only to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering OnlineRewardsClub products and services by means of user login and password requirements. The OnlineRewardsClub Network routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.

No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of OnlineRewardsClub to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your PII, OnlineRewardsClub cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with a OnlineRewardsClub Network company.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY AND SPAM**

OnlineRewardsClub is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. OnlineRewardsClub web sites, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 13 to do business with us. If you believe your child has provided OnlineRewardsClub with any personally identifiable data by registering at a  OnlineRewardsClub web site, please contact [OnlineRewardsClub](mailto:ERG@customsupportsultions.com) to have them removed. 

OnlineRewardsClub is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. § 7701). It is our policy to prohibit the sending of unsolicited or "Spam" email by OnlineRewardsClub or any of its marketing partners. 

Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is required to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from future emails about the advertiser. Although not required to by law, many email marketers also include an opt-out mechanism to enable consumers to be removed from their mailing list. This has caused some confusion for consumers in opting out. 

**STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING**

OnlineRewardsClub information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In accordance with these beliefs, OnlineRewardsClub creates opportunities for advertisers and consumers in revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy.

**CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS**

As of January 1, 2005, companies that collect personally identifiable information ("PII") from California residents and disclose such information to third parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with third parties. We have elected the second option and you may request that your PII not be shared with third parties by sending your request, including your full name, email address and postal address below.
