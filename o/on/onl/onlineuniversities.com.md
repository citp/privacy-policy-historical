## Our Data Collection

OnlineUniversities.com collects two types of data: submitted and automatic information. 

Submitted information is voluntarily provided by the user, and may include name, phone number, address, email, and any other information that may be required to match you to a product or service. This is typically submitted through a web-based form, and is collected and stored by OnlineUniversities.com. It is shared with schools and other third parties so that we may provide you with information about schools, programs, and other education-related services. By submitting this information, you authorize OnlineUniversities.com, as well as our affiliated schools and partners, to contact you in accordance with all applicable laws. However, if you receive any email communications from us, a school, or third party, you can unsubscribe through a link in the email. This will remove you from the mailing list of that sender.

Automatic information is data collected and stored whenever visitors interact with OnlineUniversities.com, and includes (but is not limited to) browser version, operating system version, and IP address. This anonymous information is used to help us to improve the website and create a more tailored user experience. “Cookies” are utilized to collect this automatic data, which is utilized for analytics, site optimization, and for advertising and marketing purposes. 

Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored in the user’s web browser. These are used for technical purposes, such as web analytics. OnlineUniversities.com’s web analytics are primarily run using Google Analytics. These advertising cookies, which are sometimes referred to as third-party cookies because they track navigation and publish ads on behalf of third parties, do not contain personally identifiable information. They do, however, enable advertisers to make ads more relevant to the user’s interests. For more information about Google Analytics, check [Google’s privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html).

By using this website, you acknowledge that OnlineUniversities.com uses cookies and consent to our use of cookies. 

Here are some examples of how we may use cookies, including uses through services and partnerships with vendors and third-party service providers:

  * Looking at demographic and other anonymous data for web optimization and other analysis
  * “Lead auditing” to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and validity of submitted information
  * Marketing and conversion tracking cookies, used for targeting and optimizing digital ad serving to improve relevance, user experience, and advertising effectiveness



You can remove cookies through your browser settings, but you may need to do this per usage. You can also generally opt out of receiving personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or that follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. To do so, visit the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA websites.
