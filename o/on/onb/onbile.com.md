  6. ### Information Sharing and Disclosure

    1. **Non Personal Aggregate Information**

We may share aggregate information with third parties, including reports generated as a result of your use of the Service, including non-identifying information and login data, for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other commercial purposes, like offering targeted advertising about other products and services. Any aggregated information shared in these instances will not contain your Personal Information. We do not aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

    2. **Personally Identifiable Information**

ONBILE employs third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf. These services include credit card processing, email service providers, data analysis, and customer services. These service providers will have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions, but will not use it for any other purposes, and are obliged to comply with this Policy.

We may release account and other personal information when we believe it necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Terms of Service, or protect the rights, property, or safety of ONBILE, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

In the event of a business transfer or sale by ONBILE, client information is generally one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the conditions of any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, you consent for their use otherwise).

Aside from what is set out above, you will be notified when information about you may be derived to third parties, and you will be able to choose not to share the information.

    3. **Combined Information**

We may combine certain Personal Information with non-personal Information in order to create information and services packages that suit your interests and preferences better. Among other things, linking that information will allow us to improve and personalize the Site and the Service. If we combine or link any information with your Personal Information, the resulting combination will be treated as Personal Information and this Policy will apply.

    4. **Disclosure by you of information of other users**

It is not permitted to collect personal information from other users through the Service, the Site or in any other way that may be connected to the use of the Service or the Site. Any information that you may choose to share in a comment or submission to the Site or the Service will be publicly available and may allow for other users to know about you. We recommend that you preserve your privacy and sensitive information, and encourage you to carefully consider what kind of information about yourself you want to disclose in your comments and observations.

    5. **Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement**

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as ourselves, at our discretion, that we believe necessary or appropriate to comply with the applicable legislation (including, but not limited to, court summons), in order to protect our property or a third party's property, and the rights thereof, or to prevent or stop any activity that is or has the risk to be illegal, immoral, inappropriate or punishable by law.

  7. ### Log Files

As it happens with most websites, we collect certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

This information may also be used to identify users who are using the service for spam or other activity that may conflict with our Terms of Service. This information will be used as a whole, and never linked back to any personal identification information.

  8. ### Cookies

Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies, stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us 'remember' information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. Users who disable cookies will not be able to use the Service, as they are required to maintain their login information to our service during a browser session.

Disabling cookies does not prevent you from accessing websites published under our system, although some features of those sites may be degraded.

These cookies can be tied back to personally identifiable information only in the event that you are logged into our Service. If you are logged in to our Service, the cookies on your computer will only identify your account within our system.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ONBILE only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See the 'Third Party Advertisers' section for more details.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies. See Third Party Advertisers.

  9. ### Links to Other Sites

This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by ONBILE. Please note that we, ONBILE, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by this Website.

  10. ### Third Party Companies, Business Transitions and Information Processing

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on our behalf or to perform services related to the management of the Service or the Site (including, but not limited to, maintenance, payments, hosting and database management services, web analytics and administration). These third parties will only have access to your Personal Information in order to perform these tasks on our behalf. However, these parties may be subject to their own privacy policies, so you are advised to consult them regularly.

In the event that ONBILE went through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of its assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

Please note that your information may be processed, stored or transferred outside of your state, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those within your area.

  11. ### Legal Disclaimer

ONBILE reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.

  12. ### Changes in this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.

  13. ### Third Party Companies, Business Transitions and Information Processing

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on our behalf or to perform services related to the management of the Service or the Site (including, but not limited to, maintenance, payments, hosting and database management services, web analytics and administration). These third parties will only have access to your Personal Information in order to perform these tasks on our behalf. However, these parties may be subject to their own privacy policies, so you are advised to consult them regularly.

You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

Please note that your information may be processed, stored or transferred outside of your state, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those within your area.
