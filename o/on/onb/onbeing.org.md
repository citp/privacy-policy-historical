# Privacy Policy for On Being / KTPP | The On Being Project

Your privacy is critically important to us. The On Being Project, formerly known as Krista Tippett Public Productions (KTPP), is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization, where we have a few fundamental principles:

> → We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)  
>  → We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  
>  → We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.  
>  → On our website and mobile apps, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

Following is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

The On Being Project operates several websites including onbeing.org, civilconversationsproject.org, and youraudioselfie.org and mobile apps for On Being. It is The On Being Project’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and mobile apps.

**Website and App Visitors**  
The On Being Project collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request as well as user path, time spent on screen, user flow, etc. The On Being Project’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how The On Being Project’s visitors use its websites and mobile apps. From time to time, The On Being Project may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website and mobile apps.

The On Being Project also collects potentially personally-identifying information like email addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on The On Being Project’s websites and mobile apps. The On Being Project only discloses logged in user and commenter email addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that the commenter email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the page where the comment was left.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**  
Certain visitors to The On Being Project’s websites and mobile apps choose to interact with The On Being Project in ways that require The On Being Project to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that The On Being Project gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to leave a comment on our mobile apps and website at OnBeing.org to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with The On Being Project are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, The On Being Project collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with The On Being Project. The On Being Project does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website- and app-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**  
The On Being Project may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and mobile apps. For instance, The On Being Project may monitor the most popular sections on the OnBeing.org site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. The On Being Project may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, The On Being Project does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**  
The On Being Project discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on The On Being Project’s behalf or to provide services available at The On Being Project’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using The On Being Project’s websites and mobile apps, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. The On Being Project will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, The On Being Project discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request, or when The On Being Project believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of The On Being Project, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a The On Being Project website or mobile app and have supplied your email address, The On Being Project may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with The On Being Project and our products and content. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. The On Being Project takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

The On Being Project uses cookies to help The On Being Project identify and track visitors, their usage of The On Being Project websites and mobile apps, and their website and mobile app access preferences. The On Being Project visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using The On Being Project’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of The On Being Project’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Business Transfers**  
If The On Being Project, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that The On Being Project goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of The On Being Project may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

**Ads & Underwriting**  
Ads and underwriting appearing on any of our websites or mobile apps may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer or mobile device each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by The On Being Project and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Comments (Reflections)**  
We use the free service Disqus as our primary commenting engine and anti-spam service, which provides each member of our community the ability to identify herself / himself in public online communities in the way they’re most comfortable. The On Being Project does not save any comments on our servers, but we encourage each person to [read the Disqus privacy policy](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy) for more information.

**Privacy Policy Changes**  
Although most changes are likely to be minor, The On Being Project may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in The On Being Project’s sole discretion. The On Being Project encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this website or mobile app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
