**Scope of This Policy**

This online privacy policy (this “Policy”) applies only to information collected through the On Being Project-owned platforms on which it is posted (collectively, this “Site”), including our websites at onbeing.org, civilconversationsproject.org, youraudioselfie.org. It does not apply to third-party platforms or to other platforms owned by the On Being Project. It also does not apply to information collected through other channels, such as over the phone or in person.

Some of the information we collect through this Site may be “personal information” — information that identifies you personally, alone, or in combination with other information available to us. Other information may be non-personally identifiable, such as information collected by cookies.

We have provided this Policy so that you will know what information we collect, how we use this information, the types of third parties with whom we may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you.

**Your Consent**

Please take a few minutes to review this Policy before using this Site. By using this Site you are consenting to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by this Policy, you may not access or use this Site.

**Your Choices**

_In General._ We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose the information you provide on or through this Site. We strive to provide choices to you at a meaningful time and in a meaningful place. This Policy describes some of your other choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving “cookies.”

_Do-Not-Track Mechanisms_. Your browser may deliver a “Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) signal” to this Site. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within these technology application industries regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.

_Previously Expressed Preferences._ You may change previously expressed preferences regarding how we use the information you provide on or through this Site. For example, after signing up to receive our electronic newsletter, you may decide to stop receiving it by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter’s footer.

We are continually improving and adding to the features and functionality of this Site and the products we offer through this Site. As a result of these changes (or changes in the law), we may need to update or revise this Policy. Accordingly, we reserve the right to update or modify this Policy at any time, without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Policy behind the link marked “Privacy Policy” at the bottom of each page of this Site. Your continued use of this Site after we have posted the revised Policy constitutes your agreement to be bound by the revised Policy. However, we will honor the terms that were in effect when we gathered data from you.

The information we receive may depend on your browser or device settings.

The information we receive from your web browser and device may or may not be, in and of itself, personally identifiable. However, we may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you, or we may combine it with information that does identify you.

_Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies_. A “cookie” is a small file placed on your device when you visit a site that can be understood by the site that issued the cookie. We use cookies and other technologies, including device identifiers, to collect information and support certain features of this Site. For example, we may use these technologies to collect information about the ways visitors use this Site — which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page.

**Information About Third-Party Cookies (Ad Choices)**

In addition to the cookies we deliver to your computer or mobile device through this Site, certain third parties may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons. For example, we may use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Sites. To learn more about Google Analytics, [click here.](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html)

Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors over time and across nonaffiliated websites and/or delivering targeted advertisements either on this Site or on other websites.

You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our Sites. For example, if you don’t want information about your visit to this Site sent to Google Analytics, you may download an opt-out browser add-on by [clicking here.](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) Please note that the add-on does not prevent information from being sent to us.

In addition, if you would like to opt out of having interest-based information collected by certain entities during your visits to this Site or other websites, please [click here for a “Website Opt-Out.”](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) You will be directed to an industry-developed website that contains mechanisms for choosing whether each listed entity may collect and use data for online behavioral advertising purposes. It may be that some of the third parties that collect interest-based information on this Site do not participate in the industry-developed opt-out website, in which case the best way to avoid third-party tracking of your online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies.

The Website Opt-Out described above works only on websites. To opt out of having participating entities track your behaviors for advertising purposes when you are using a mobile app, download and use the Digital Advertising Alliance’s [“App Choices” app.](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) As with the Website Opt-Out, the “Mobile App Opt-Out” prevents tracking only by participating entities.

Please note that the Website Opt-Out and Mobile App Opt-Out are device-specific, and the Website Opt-Out is browser-specific. If you wish to opt out from having interest-based information collected by participating entities across all devices and browsers, you need take the steps outlined above from each device and browser.

**How to Access, Update, or Correct Your Information**

If you want to access, update, or correct your information, please contact us using the information provided below. We will respond to you within a reasonable time and, in any case, within the time limits established by applicable law. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, we will provide access and correct or delete any inaccurate information you discover. In some cases, however, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so or if we are unable to verify your identify. If you seek deletion of information that you provided when you were a minor, please contact us using the information provided below.

**Steps We Take To Safeguard Your Personal Information**

We maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technological measures to protect the confidentiality and security of information you submit on or through this Site. Unfortunately, no website, server, or database is completely secure or “hacker-proof.” We therefore cannot guarantee that your information will not be disclosed, misused, or lost by accident or by the unauthorized acts of others. Further, we cannot control dissemination of personal information you post on or through this Site using any social networking tools we may provide, and you should have no expectation of privacy in such information.

**How We Share Your Information**

_With Third-Party Vendors_. We may share information collected through this Site with third-party vendors who act for us or on our behalf. For example, we use third-party vendors to design and operate this Site; to conduct surveys; and to help us with our communication efforts. These third-party vendors may need information about you to perform their functions. Typically, they are required by contract to keep your information confidential and to use it only to provide services on our behalf; however, as described below, we may allow them to use aggregate or de-identified data for their own purposes or to market the products and services of their other clients.

_With Third-Party Social Media Platforms._ We may provide functionality on this Site that allows you to automatically post information to a third-party social media platform (such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google+). If you choose to take advantage of this functionality, people with access to your profile on the third-party platform will be able to see your post. Thus, you should have no expectation of privacy in those actions.

_In Aggregate or De-identified Form._ We use information collected through this Site to create a compiled, aggregate view of usage patterns. We may share aggregate information with third parties so we and they can better understand our community. We may also share with third parties information about how particular individuals use this Site, but only on a de-identified basis (“Individualized Data”). Individualized Data is not personally identifiable, but it does reflect the usage patterns of a particular Site user, as opposed to Site users collectively. We may provide basic demographic information (gender and age) in conjunction with providing Individualized Data. Third parties typically use this information for analytical purposes and to market their own products and services.

_As Part of a Business Transfer_. Your information may be transferred to a successor organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of this Site to another organization or if we merge with another organization or if we liquidate our assets and sell them individually. If such a transfer occurs, the successor organization’s use of your information will still be subject to this Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

_To Comply with Laws and Protect Our Rights and the Rights of Others_. We may disclose your information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order, or a subpoena. We may also disclose your information to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of this Site; to enforce or apply our online [Terms of Use](https://onbeing.org/terms-of-use/) or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.

_As Described in a Privacy Notice or Click-Through Agreement_. We reserve the right to disclose your information as described in any privacy notice posted on this Site or as described in any click-through agreement to which you have agreed.

**Children Under the Age of Thirteen**

We are proud of this Site and we strive to ensure that it does not offend people of any age. However, this Site is not intended for children or minors under the age of thirteen years without the permission of a parent or guardian. If you believe that a child has submitted personal information on or through this Site without the consent and supervision of a parent or guardian, please contact us using the information provided below so that we can take appropriate action.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Site may provide links to other websites operated by third parties, including in some cases our third-party vendors. We do not control these websites and are not responsible for their data practices. Any information you provide to third parties on their websites is covered under their privacy and data collection policies and is not covered by this Policy.
