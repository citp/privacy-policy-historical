ON24 Inc. Statement of Privacy  
At ON24, Inc., we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. ON24 has established this online privacy policy so that you can understand the care with which we treat your personal information. 

ON24 strives to comply with all applicable laws that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, ON24 intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your information to countries that may not require protection. 

This policy details the information we gather from you, how we may use or disclose that information, and our efforts to protect it.

  
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. Personal information collected by ON24 is usually limited to email address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

  
In connection with your use of our site, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from and about you in different ways.

ON24 strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under circumstances where this policy would violate a lawful court order and/or Federal, State, or Local law, or Statute. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where ON24, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or agents are located.

  
You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, if any, including fees. Therefore, we recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.

Where ON24 collects personal information on the web, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why personal information will be collected and whether we plan to share such personal information outside of ON24 or those working on ON24's behalf. ON24 does not intend to transfer personal information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on ON24's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. 

  
You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to ON24. The notice we intend to provide where ON24 collects personal information on the web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit ON24's web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. 

If you chose to have a relationship with ON24, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship. 

  
Wherever your personal information may be held within ON24 or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 

ON24 employs the most up-to-date and industry-standard encryption methods, including firewalls. We restrict access to any registered user portions of our site to computers running web browsers that support Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. We use industry standard practices to insure your personally identifiable information is secure, including firewalls.

Regardless of the precautions taken by us, ON24 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. ON24 reserves the right to change this policy at any time without prior notice. Revisions will be posted on our web site. This statement of privacy is for the information of our users and does not constitute a contract or modification of any contract.

  
To the extent that you do provide us with personal information, ON24 wishes to maintain accurate personal information. Where we collect personal information from you on the web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting ON24 should you need to update or correct that information.
