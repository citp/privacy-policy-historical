												OnSale, Inc. and its affiliates (“OnSale,” “we, “us”) shares your concerns 
												about the protection of your personal information online. This Privacy Policy 
												(the “Policy”) describes our practices regarding the collection and use of 
												information through our family of websites, including the website currently 
												located at www.onsale.com and other websites owned and operated by OnSale that 
												link to this Policy (collectively, the “Site”). By using the Site, you signify 
												your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree 
												to this Policy, please do not use the Site.<br>
												<br>
												Please note that OnSale reviews its privacy practices from time to time, and 
												that those practices are subject to change. We ask that you bookmark and 
												periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most 
												current version of our Privacy Policy. You can determine when this Policy was 
												last revised by checking the “Last revised” legend at the bottom of the Policy. 
												To contact OnSale about privacy issues, to report a violation of our Privacy 
												Policy or to raise any other issue, please e-mail us at Privacy Q&amp;A.<br>
												<br>
												This Policy is the sole authorized statement of OnSale's practices with respect 
												to the online collection of personally identifiable information and the usage 
												of such information. Any summaries of this Policy generated by third party 
												software or otherwise (for example, in connection with the "Platform for 
												Privacy Preferences" or "P3P") shall have no legal effect, are in no way 
												binding upon OnSale, shall not be relied upon in substitute for this Policy, 
												and neither supersede nor modify this Policy.<br>
												<br>
												The Information We Gather.<br>
												<br>
												OnSale gathers two types of information about visitors to our Site:<br>
												<br>
												(1) Non-personally identifiable information: When visitors come to our Site, we 
												collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages 
												of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which 
												hyperlinks were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves the logging of 
												the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to 
												the Site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it may be 
												possible to determine from an IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider 
												and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.<br>
												<br>
												We also use “cookies” — that is, small text files placed on a visitor’s 
												computer hard drive — for a number of Site-related reasons, including to help 
												us personalize your online auction experience, keep track of your buying and 
												selling activities, recall your specific information on subsequent visits, 
												assist in identifying problems with our server, monitor the length of time each 
												visitor spends at any particular area of the Site and determine the popularity 
												of the various OnSale services made available through the Site. Essentially, 
												cookies are a visitor’s identification card for the OnSale computers, or 
												servers, that placed them there. Cookies are only read by the server that 
												placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow OnSale 
												to serve you better and more efficiently, and to further enhance the value of 
												the Site to you. Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether 
												cookies will be accepted by your web browser. For more information on how to do 
												so, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser. If you choose 
												to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience fully the interactive 
												features on the Site. Additional information on cookies could be found at 
												Cookies FAQs.<br>
												<br>
												In addition, OnSale allows certain third-party ad servers or ad networks to 
												display advertisements on OnSale web pages. Some of these companies may place a 
												cookie on your computer. This cookie allows these companies to recognize your 
												computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, these 
												companies may compile information about where the user of your computer viewed 
												their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked on, 
												allowing them to deliver targeted advertisements to you. OnSale does not have 
												access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by these companies.
												<br>
												<br>
												Site pages may also use “pixel tag” technology (also known as “web beacons”) to 
												help us track visitors to those pages and to deliver co-branded and other 
												services. OnSale may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or 
												online newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and 
												acted upon. Web beacons are used as a statistical tool and not used to access 
												your personal information. Web beacons collect only a limited set of 
												information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a 
												description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Site pages may also 
												contain web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help determine 
												the effectiveness of OnSale’s online advertising campaigns.<br>
												<br>
												(2) Personally identifiable information: In general, you do not have to provide 
												personally identifiable information to us in order to use the Site. However, 
												particular services made available through the Site may require us to collect 
												personally identifiable information from you. We collect such personally 
												identifiable information only when you affirmatively provide it to us - for 
												example, when submitting information in order to participate in an online 
												auction. You may be asked to provide your contact information (including, for 
												example, first name, surname, street address, email address, telephone number) 
												and, when applicable, credit card information.<br>
												<br>
												Please note that we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable 
												information from children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years 
												of age) without obtaining parental consent.
												<br>
												<br>
												We also note that, in particular instances, cookies placed on your computer may 
												be linked to personally identifiable information that you have provided to us 
												or our advertising partners. As noted above, you should be able to control how 
												and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser.
												<br>
												<br>
												OnSale does not control the acts of its Site visitors. All Site visitors should 
												be aware that, when they disclose personally identifiable information through 
												publicly-accessible Site features such as OnSale Report Card, OnSale Chat, 
												OnSale Community, or other online forums, or in communications with other Site 
												visitors, this information may be collected and used by others, and may be 
												difficult or impossible to remove from the Site. In the event that you 
												encounter any OnSale user who is improperly collecting or using information 
												about you or other users, please contact Privacy Q&amp;A.
												<br>
												<br>
												How We Use (and Do Not Use) the Information We Gather.<br>
												<br>
												Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways that 
												OnSale uses the information that it gathers. Keep in mind that, while OnSale 
												encourages all third parties involved – including but not limited to its 
												affiliates and advertisers – to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of 
												our visitors and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible 
												manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or 
												omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information 
												received either from OnSale or independently.
												<br>
												<br>
												(1) Non-personally identifiable information: OnSale uses non-personally 
												identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful 
												online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective 
												characteristics and behavior of our visitors, and by measuring demographics and 
												interests regarding specific areas and services of the Site. We provide 
												statistical information based on this data to advertisers, affiliates and other 
												current and potential business partners. We also use the aggregate data to 
												inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked 
												on links to their web sites.
												<br>
												<br>
												The Site contains links to other Internet web sites, including co-branded or 
												other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by OnSale. 
												Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy 
												practices or the content of such web sites, including such sites’ use of any 
												information (such as IP number, browser type or operating system) collected 
												when visitors to the Site click through links to those sites. Even though such 
												information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to 
												become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites.<br>
												<br>
												(2) Personally identifiable information: OnSale seeks to provide notice 
												wherever personally identifiable information is collected on the Site. OnSale 
												reserves the right to release any personally identifiable registration 
												information regarding you to third parties who provide goods or services that 
												we believe may be of interest to you. Although you may not “opt out” of the 
												registration process if you wish to use Site features that require 
												registration, we attempt to provide you with an ability to “opt out” of 
												receiving promotional materials from OnSale and/or its affiliates, advertisers 
												or other business partners. If you decide that you would like to discontinue 
												receiving promotional information from such third parties, please contact those 
												third parties directly.<br>
												<br>
												The “My OnSale” feature of the Site provides Site users with an ability to 
												create personal profiles that can be used in connection with the Site and 
												Site-related services. Such profile will contain personally identifiable 
												information, including but not limited to your name, address and, if you so 
												choose, your credit card information.
												<br>
												<br>
												Some of the services that we provide in connection with the Site are fee-based; 
												such service fees may be paid by you with your credit card. We note that, as 
												part of the “My OnSale” feature or through your use of Site-related services, 
												your credit card information may be disclosed by us to sellers and third 
												parties in order to complete a transaction in which your payment is by credit 
												card; you should use extreme caution before allowing your credit card 
												information (and other personally identifiable information) to be accessed by 
												such sellers and third parties, and you should investigate whether such sellers 
												and third parties have a privacy policy the terms of which are acceptable to 
												you before allowing access to such information. We note that only if the user 
												voluntarily requests that the credit card information be transferred will any 
												transfer take place — for example, if/when a user clicks a “submit form” button 
												or other button. We note that sellers and other third parties may have privacy 
												policies that differ significantly from this Policy.
												<br>
												<br>
												OnSale seeks to limit its own e-mail solicitations to those Site users who have 
												not “opted out” of receiving such communications. The solicitations are limited 
												in that they, among other things, will seek to clearly indicate the originator 
												of the e-mail and to provide the customer with either information regarding or 
												a method for “opting out” of receiving future communications of a similar 
												nature.
												<br>
												<br>
												In addition, OnSale sometimes uses individual data to “target” advertising — to 
												decide which advertisements and sponsor messages to show to which Site users. 
												As an example, if Sponsor Co. wishes to display its advertising only to 
												females, OnSale may use registration data to ensure that Sponsor Co.’s ads are 
												displayed only to female visitors to the Site.
												<br>
												<br>
												OnSale may use individual users’ data to “pre-populate” forms which are 
												displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by OnSale and/or its 
												sponsors. Such pre-population of a form does not automatically transfer any 
												data to any advertiser or third party. Only if the user voluntarily requests 
												that such data be transferred will any transfer take place — for example, 
												if/when a user clicks a “submit form” button or other button.
												<br>
												<br>
												If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your 
												contact information and correspondence, and reserve the right to use your email 
												address, and any information you provide in your message, to respond thereto. 
												Such contact information may also be used to send promotional materials to you 
												unless you “opt out” of receiving such promotional materials of a similar 
												nature from us. In addition, from time to time we may email important 
												information regarding the use of the Site or services to visitors who have 
												provided us with their email addresses. Because this information may be 
												important to your use of the Site, you may not “opt out” of receiving these 
												emails.<br>
												<br>
												OnSale works with third parties who provide services that may include, but are 
												not necessarily limited to, website hosting, ad serving, data analysis and 
												email services. We reserve the right to share personally identifiable 
												information with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services, 
												and will seek to impose confidentiality obligations on such service providers.
												<br>
												<br>
												Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to release information 
												concerning any visitor when we believe that visitor is in violation of our User 
												Agreement or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably 
												suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, and to release such 
												information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, 
												discovery requests and as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right 
												to release information about our visitors when we believe that such release is 
												required to protect the rights, property, safety or security of OnSale, our 
												partners, our visitors or the public, or to respond to an emergency.<br>
												<br>
												If and when OnSale sponsors contests or sweepstakes, or third parties sponsor 
												contests or sweepstakes in conjunction with OnSale, either OnSale or the third 
												party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or 
												registration area for the promotion or sweepstakes. That privacy information, 
												to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that 
												particular promotion or sweepstakes. If no such information is posted, this 
												Policy and/or the sponsor’s privacy policy will govern the collection and use 
												of such information.
												<br>
												<br>
												Occasionally OnSale or its third party sponsors may offer Site visitors an 
												opportunity to participate in a survey, participation in which may require 
												submission of personally identifiable information. Unless expressly provided 
												otherwise in connection with the survey, this Policy and/or the sponsor’s 
												privacy policy will govern the collection and use of such information. Again, 
												you are always free not to participate in any survey.
												<br>
												<br>
												Security.<br>
												<br>
												OnSale has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and 
												alteration of visitor information which is under our control. Unfortunately, no 
												security system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet, can be 
												guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result of the foregoing, while we strive to 
												protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the 
												security of our servers, the means by which information is transmitted between 
												your computer and OnSale's servers, or any information provided to us or to any 
												third party through or in connection with the Site. You provide all such 
												information at your own risk.<br>
												<br>
												Updating, Correcting, Changing, and Deleting Personal Information.<br>
												<br>
												The “My OnSale” feature of the Site provides you with an ability to update, 
												correct or change the personally identifiable information stored in your 
												customer profile. Also, certain personally identifiable information can be 
												deleted from your customer profile; for example, if your credit card 
												information is part of your customer profile, you can choose to delete that 
												information from your profile. Keep in mind, however, that there may be 
												residual information that will remain within OnSale databases, access logs and 
												other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable 
												information. The residual information will not intentionally be used by us for 
												commercial purposes; however, OnSale reserves the right, from time to time, to 
												recontact former customers or visitors to the Site.<br>
												<br>
												Business Transfers.<br>
												<br>
												OnSale reserves the right to transfer any and all information that we collect 
												from visitors, or that we otherwise collect concerning or in connection with 
												the Site, to a third party in the event of a sale or other transfer of assets 
												or of any portion of our business.<br>
												<br>
												Offline vs. Online Practices.
												<br>
												<br>
												Please note that this Policy applies solely to our online information-gathering 
												and dissemination practices in connection with the Site, and does not apply to 
												any of our practices conducted offline.<br>
												<br>
												Questions and Concerns.<br>
