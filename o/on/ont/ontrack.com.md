### What Personal Information Ontrack Passively Collects: Cookies and Other Technologies

Ontrack’s web site, online services, applications, email messages, and advertisements, if any, may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons ( pixel tags and web beacons are together known as “Other Technologies”) to collect information about you. A cookie is a small data file stored on the web browser on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie associates the identification numbers built into the cookie with information about you that you have provided to us. This association allows us to recognize who you are when you arrive at our web site. Other Technologies tell us where on our website you have visited, counts how many users visited certain web pages within our web site, and measures the effectiveness of advertisements, if any, and web searches.

Like most web sites, we also automatically collect some tracking information and store that tracking information in an anonymous, aggregated and non-personal format. This tracking information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating system used, date and time stamps and click stream data. We use this tracking information to understand and analyze trends, to administer our web site, and to learn about user behavior on our web site. However, Ontrack may use IP addresses to identify you when Ontrack feels, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to enforce compliance with its TOU, this Privacy Policy, to protect its services, Web Site, systems, information, employees, business partners, affiliates, users, customers or others, or when required by law.

### Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties

As a general rule, Ontrack does not share with or disclose to any third parties any specific Personal Information, except (a) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, (b) when Ontrack has your permission, or (c) under special circumstances such as, but not limited to, when Ontrack believes in good faith that the law requires such disclosure, or when the disclosure will protect the safety of others.

**Affiliates:** Ontrack may share any or all of your Personal Information with and among its affiliated or related entities, including Ontrack affiliates located in the EU and elsewhere. Any onward transfer of your Personal Information is pursuant to the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework, discussed later in this Privacy Policy. The transfer of your Personal Information to our affiliates is done to allow these entities to offer you information about their businesses, products or services that may be of interest to you, or for other lawful business purposes.

**Business Partners and Service Providers:** Ontrack may share your Personal Information with companies which provide services such as, but not limited to, online chat, product promotion via email, order fulfillment, e-commerce, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in products and services, information processing, conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys, and online job applications. These companies are obligated to protect your Personal Information.

**Other:** Ontrack may, if required by law, legal process, litigation and/or requests from public or governmental authorities, disclose your Personal Information. We may also disclose Personal Information about you if we determine, in good faith and in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary for purposes of national security, law enforcement, the prevention of a crime, or other issues of public importance. We may also disclose Personal Information about you if we determine, in our sole discretion, that it is reasonably necessary to enforce the TOU, or to protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a corporate reorganization, merger or acquisition, or sale, we may transfer any and all Personal Information we collect to a relevant third party.
