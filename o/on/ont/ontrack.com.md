This Privacy Policy will explain the following regarding our collection of information: 

**The information we collect.**

  * Information that is needed to respond to your request for our services.
  * Whenever you shop our online store, at the time of check-out, we obtain the information we need from you to complete your transaction. To process your order, we require you to supply us with your correct billing, shipping and contact information. The transfer of this information is secure and cannot be received or read by others. 
  * We also allow you to register to receive periodic email correspondence from us through our "Newsletter Center." The information we collect for this purpose is your name and email address. 
  * When you "Ask a Question" through our online support center, we obtain the information we need from you to answer your questions appropriately. To be able to effectively respond to your inquiry, we require you to supply us with your name and email address.



 **How we use the information we collect.**

  *  **Online Orders**  
We use the personal information you supply when placing an online order to complete and ship your order. Your email address is used to send you an order confirmation, as well as to alert you to any changes in the availability of the items you ordered. 
  * **Technical Support**  
We use the personal information you supply when you submit a support question to respond to your question. Your email address is used to send a response from our Technical Support team. 
  * **Email messages**
    * If you provide permission by subscribing through our newsletter center, we will send occasional email messages to let you know about changes to our Web site, free promotional offers and special discounts on products that we believe will be of interest to you. 
    * Email messages also may be sent to invite you to participate in a contest or survey, or to provide you with information about a product you have purchased from Ontrack. 
    * We offer free email newsletters for our customers located in the United States. With every email they receive, customers are provided an option to remove themselves from receiving future emails. 
  * **Surveys and Contests**  
Occasionally, Ontrack requests information through surveys or contests. Requested information may include contact information (such as your name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as your zip code and occupation). Contact information will be used to notify contest winners and award prizes, unless you acknowledge that you would like to receive future correspondence (emails, special offers, etc.) from Ontrack.
