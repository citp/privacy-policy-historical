When visiting our web pages, our web servers temporarily stores any access in log files (so-called server log files). Access data includes:

  * The IP address of the device used by you for page retrieval (PC, smartphone, tablet, ...)
  * The date and time of access
  * Name and URL of the retrieved website

  * The address of the previously visited website (Referrer URL), if you have reached there from a reference to our offer (if transmitted by the requesting web browser)



The collection and processing of this data is for the purpose of operation, system security and optimization of the Internet offer. A storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place. The IMISE reserves the right to evaluate the log data retrospectively, if there are concrete indications for the reasonable suspicion of illegal use. 

The data stored in the log files will be deleted after no later than seven days. Further storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses are deleted or alienated, so that assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.

## safety

The IMISE uses technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data managed by us against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.

We point out that data transmission by e-mail is usually unsecured. It can't be ruled out that transmitted data can be read by unauthorized persons and possibly even falsified.
