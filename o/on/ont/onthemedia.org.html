<h2>Online Privacy Policy</h2>

 </div>


<div id="main">

<p>WNYC values your participation in our public radio community, both online and offline, and assures you that your privacy is a priority to us. The WNYC web site adheres to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information) and preserving the integrity of this online medium.</p>

<h2>Visiting WNYC.org:</h2>
<p>When you visit our sites, our web server automatically recognizes only your domain name, where you are coming to us from and what browser you are using. We use this information to analyze how traffic flows at WNYC.org, but no one can contact or identify you from this information.
</p>

<h2>Cookies:</h2>
<p>WNYC places an industry-standard "cookie" file on your computer to more accurately count the number of visitors and track activity on our websites. This cookie is totally anonymous and does not store any personal information about individual users. Cookies can also be used to store certain visitor preferences, like your favorite media player or a bulletin board password. In such cases, users have a choice of storing such information in a cookie or typing it each time they visit the site.</p>

<h2>E-mail Communications:</h2>
<p>WNYC regularly sends email Newsletters and membership correspondence to our registered members and visitors with information about WNYC programs, services or membership opportunities. If you do not wish to receive any email from WNYC, please indicate your preference on the pledge form when making a pledge, visit the e-mail newsletter sign up page to "opt-out", or contact Listener Services: <a href="mailto:listenerservices@wnyc.org">listenerservices@wnyc.org</a> or 212-669-3333. We will do our best to make your change in a timely manner.</p>

<p>WNYC never sells, exchanges or lends to third parties any email or telephone information you provide when making a Membership Pledge or subscribing to our E-mail communications.</p>

<h2>When You Make an Online Membership Pledge:</h2>
<p>WNYC will ask you to provide the information necessary to process and service your membership pledge: name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number. This information is encrypted for your security and is only seen by our membership staff who processes your gift and our contracted fulfillment agencies.</p>

<h2>List sharing policy:</h2>
<p>WNYC may occasionally share names and postal addresses collected through membership pledges with carefully selected organizations. If you do not want your address exchanged, please contact Listener Services: <a href="mailto:listenerservices@wnyc.org">listenerservices@wnyc.org</a> or call 212-669-3333 to classify your membership record as "No Exchange". It is WNYC policy not to sell or exchange e-mail addresses with any organization.</p>

<h2>Bulletin Board Participation:</h2>
<p>WNYC reserves the right to collect the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to our bulletin board, information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information we collect is to ensure compliance with bulletin board rules and occasionally to alert members and visitors to opt-in to our e-mail newsletter but is never shared with other organizations.</p>

<h2>Security:</h2>
<p>When you contribute to WNYC online, the information you provide is encrypted using a Secure Socket Layer Certificate (SSL) and transferred using secure protocol to WNYC where it is stored in a secure database. The SSL Certificate will provide 128-bit-encryption as long as users are running 128-bit enabled browsers. WNYC has aggressive security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.</p>

<h2>Children: Under 13:</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old in order to register for our Discussion Forums. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Age 13 -18:</h2>
<p>Visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 must obtain permission from a parent or guardian before registering for the Discussions or otherwise sending any personally-identifying information.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, you must be a least 18 years old in order to participate in any online contests.</p>

<h2>Links:</h2>
<p>WNYC.org contains links to a wide variety of websites, including some which may not follow the same privacy policies as WNYC. WNYC is not responsible for the privacy policies of those other sites or how they treat information about their users. Users who choose to follow links from WNYC.org, should make themselves familiar with target sites' privacy policies.</p>

<h2>Changes to Privacy Policy:</h2>
<p>WNYC will never use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice without notifying users. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site, attempt to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.
