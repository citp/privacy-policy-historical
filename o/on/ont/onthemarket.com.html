            Personal information collected
            </h3>
            <p>
            When you visit or use the Site or use our services, you may be asked to provide certain information about
            yourself, including your name and your contact details. We may also collect information about how you use this
            Site, including your searches, the properties and pages you look at, the advertisers or partners you contact and
            the contents of the emails you send to them. Finally, we may also collect information from any correspondence
            that you have with us. Collectively, we refer to this as "Your Information".
            </p>
            <p>
            All of the forms where you might enter personal information on our Site have tick box options to enable you to
            accept or decline to our use of Your Information for marketing purposes. We always use the most recently
            submitted form to be your current consent status. If you are a registered user, but not signed in when you submit
            a form, we won't be able to use your saved settings so will deem your consent choice to be as per the form you
            submit at the time.
            </p>

            <h3>
            How we use Your Information
            </h3>
            <p>
            Your Information will enable us to provide you with access to all parts of this Site and to supply the services and
            features that you have requested. We may aggregate the information to identify patterns which we can use in our
            marketing and to help us develop, administer, support and improve our services and features.
            </p>
            <p>
            We may use Your Information to contact you for your views on our services and to notify you occasionally about
            important changes or developments to this Site or our services. Where you have consented, we may also use
            Your Information to contact you with details about any other products or services we or our partners or
            advertisers offer that may be of interest to you. Where you have consented to being contacted by third parties,
            we may make Your Information available to them. If you change your mind about being contacted in the future,
            please email us at info@agentsmutual.co.uk and tell us.
            </p>
            <p>
            The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information.
            </p>

            <h4>
            Contacting advertisers
            </h4>
            <p>
            The information that you enter into any of the forms we offer to allow you to contact advertisers is recorded by us
            and then sent to the advertiser that you chose to contact. This helps them provide you with a more personalised
            service. We also send the advertiser details of your last search to help them find property that matches your
            requirements more closely. If you are a registered user and signed in when you contact an advertiser, we include
            your settings to help them to provide more personalised services to you.
            </p>

            <h4>
            Telephone calls
            </h4>
            <p>
            When you contact our advertisers using a unique telephone number displayed on the OnTheMarket.com site,
            information regarding the time and date of the call, status of the call (answered, unanswered, engaged)
            along with your telephone number (when presented) will be available to that advertiser. If the advertiser you contact has opted
            into our telephone recording functionality, your phone calls will also be recorded for training and monitoring
            purposes. The recordings will only be available to the advertiser you contacted and Agents' Mutual Ltd staff.
            </p>

            <h4>
            "Send to a friend" (Email a friend)
            </h4>
            <p>
            When you use the "Send to a friend" feature of this Site we record which properties you have sent to the friend,
            solely so that we can track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details provided in the email for
            internal monitoring of the service. We will NOT add any information collected in this manner to our mailing lists or
            inform the advertiser, to protect you and the recipient's privacy.
            </p>

            <h4>
            Registering with us
            </h4>
            <p>
            If you&nbsp;register&nbsp;with us, we save the details you provide and use them to enable us to personalise the service we
            offer to you. You can update&nbsp;your details at any time via the Site. When you are signed in, we automatically pre-
            populate your saved details on contact forms.
            </p>

            <h4>
            Saving properties
            </h4>
            <p>
            If you&nbsp;register&nbsp;with us and&nbsp;save properties&nbsp;you are interested in, we can identify which properties you have saved.
            We may anonymously aggregate these details to indicate how many users have saved a particular property, but
            we will not make available to third parties any personal data relating to which users have saved which properties.
            </p>

            <h4>
            Using the property alerts and saved searches
            </h4>
            <p>
            If you&nbsp;register&nbsp;with us, save searches and/or use the&nbsp;property alerts&nbsp;feature to receive notification when new
            properties matching your criteria are added to this Site, we record the settings you use and which properties have
            been sent to you. We do not make any information about any property that has been sent to you available to our
            advertisers or third parties.
            </p>

            <h3>

            </p>
            <p>
            When our service is available via the websites of our partners, those partners may have access to Your
            Information. Their use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policies. We are not responsible
            for the privacy policies and practices of any other websites, even if you access them using links from this Site or if

            </p>
            <p>
            If our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, Your

            </p>
            <p>

            Information to them in order to deliver the service. By using this Site you consent to us providing Your Information
            to the third parties licensed by us to provide such services. We may also use third parties to provide services on
            our behalf which may include processing (but not using themselves) Your Information e.g. to complete partial
            addresses or to augment the information we hold about you. In either case, we will not pass Your Information to
            anyone who is not also notified with the Information Commissioner's Office as a data controller or is not subject to

            commercially without your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
            We will not otherwise disclose, sell or distribute Your Information to any third party without your permission
            unless we are required to do so by law.

            Cookies and tracking
            </h3>
            <p>
            Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enable us to personalise your visits to this Site, simplify the signing-in
            procedure, keep track of your preferences and track the usage of this Site. Cookies are small pieces of
            information that are stored in the hard drive of your computer by your browser. Your browser will have the option
            to prevent websites using cookies (your browser's help screen or manual will tell you how to do this), but please
            note that this may reduce the functionality of this Site and other websites. Further information about the cookies
            we use can be found here.
            </p>
            <p>
            Like all websites, our servers automatically record 'log files' containing information about the volume and
            characteristics of our Site traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of time spent on Site. We use
            log files to build pictures of how our Site is used that help us to monitor and improve the service. We cannot
            identify you from your log files.

            <h3>
            Security, storage and transfer of information
            </h3>
            <p>
            We follow strict security procedures to ensure that your personal information is not damaged, destroyed, or
            disclosed to a third party without your permission (unless they are providing services as outlined in the 'who has
            access to Your Information' section above) and to prevent unauthorised access to it. The computers that store
            the information are kept in a secure facility with restricted physical access and we use secure firewalls and other
            measures to restrict electronic access. If we are working with third parties we will require them to have in place
            similar measures to protect Your Information.
            </p>
            <p>
            All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to
            perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We will explicitly ask you when
            we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we
            disclose information to you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing
            your&nbsp;my details&nbsp;page.
            </p>
            <p>
            Your Information will not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area.
            </p>
            <p>
            We will retain Your Information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law.

            <h3>
            Property details displayed on OnTheMarket.com
            </h3>
            <p>
            OnTheMarket.com does not accept UK property listings directly from consumers. If you are the owner of a
            property being displayed for sale or for rent on our website this is because the agent you have chosen to use for
            the sale or the letting of your property has a contract with us to display the details of your property on our Site
            and thereby place the information about your property fully in the public domain.
            </p>
            <p>
            Details held by us about a property do not comprise personal data as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998.
            OnTheMarket.com may use the data which we hold about properties advertised to provide professional valuation
            services and other data services to third parties. If your property is listed for sale or rent on OnTheMarket.com
            you may ask us not to use some or all of the details of your property to provide such data services. In this event
            please write to the Data Controller, Agents' Mutual Limited, PO Box 450, Aldershot, Guildford GU11 9FZ, stating
            your full name and address, confirmation that you are the owner of the property upon whose instructions we are
            entitled to act, the full postal address of your property, the date it was placed on the market for sale or rent, and
            the name address and telephone number of the agent you have instructed to market the property. We will
            consider your request but are not under an obligation to take any action in this regard (e.g. taking your property
            off our Site); this is ultimately a matter to be dealt with between you and your estate agent.
            </p>
            <h3>
            Changes to the policy
            </h3>
            <p>
            We may change this policy from time to time as we add new services or features or in response to changes in the
            law or our commercial arrangements. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this Site.
