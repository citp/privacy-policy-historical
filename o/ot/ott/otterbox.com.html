This site is owned and operated by Otter Products, LLC. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Otter Products, LLC, 
we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you 
should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.<br><br>

<strong>INFORMATION OTTER PRODUCTS, LLC GATHERS AND TRACKS</strong><br>

Otter Products, LLC gathers two types of information about users:

    <ul>
    	<li>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive 
    	our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, and from participation in polls and surveys.</li>
    	<li>Information Otter Products, LLC gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views 
    	throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers 
    	and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Otter Products, LLC derives its revenue mainly 
    	from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to 
    	users. Under no circumstances does Otter Products, LLC divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.</li>
    </ul>

<strong>Otter Products, LLC Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</strong><br><br>

<strong>Optional Voluntary Information</strong><br>
We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:

     <ul>
     	<li><strong>Electronic newsletters policy </strong>: We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users who opt-in to our email program. 
     	Otter Products, LLC gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing 
     	list by following the directions at the bottom of each email newsletter. We do not share, sell or lend our customer's email addresses.</li>
     	
     	<li><strong>Message boards/forums policy</strong>: Users of the site's blog must register separately for this 
     	service (free of charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During 
     	registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.</li>
     	
     	<li><strong>Surveys</strong>: Otter Products, LLC may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our 
     	content to our audience. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.</li>
     </ul>
     
<strong>Usage Tracking</strong>:<br>
Otter Products, LLC tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data 
about individual users. Otter Products, LLC does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, 
and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).<br><br>

Otter Products, LLC sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is 
never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and 
don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page 
performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.<br><br>

<strong>Cookies</strong>:<br>
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal 
Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly 
provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data 
off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Otter Products, LLC uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). 
Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.<br><br>

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you 
will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do 
need cookies to participate actively in our blog, polling and surveys.
Privacy Policy Use.<br><br>

<strong>Information Usage</strong>:<br>
Otter Products, LLC uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, 
whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.<br><br>

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users 
to participate in polls and surveys. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), 
and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. 
<strong>Otter Products, LLC never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners</strong>.<br><br>

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. 
We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better 
service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't 
track which terms a particular user enters.<br><br>

Otter Products, LLC creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. 
This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent 
to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know 
that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with 
applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.<br><br>

<strong>Sharing of information</strong>:<br>

Otter Products, LLC uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers 
better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share 
information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process 
or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.<br><br>


<strong>YOUR CONSENT</strong>:<br>

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Otter Products, LLC. If we decide to change our privacy policy, 
we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
