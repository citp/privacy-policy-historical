      <br>
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the

      a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:<br>
      <br>
      Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a

      <br>
      Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is 
      treated.<br>

      best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">ELECTRONIC PRODUCT 
      REGISTRATION</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When you buy and install a 
      new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When 
      you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've 
      already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If 
      you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile 
      for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to 
      review or update that information, you can visit the Profile Center, click 
      on Update Profile, and edit any of the Personal Information in your 
      profile. If you haven't already created a Registration ID, we will ask you 
      to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">CUSTOMER PROFILES</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As mentioned above, every 
      registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is 
      assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure 
      that only you can access your profile.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When you register, we 
      create your profile, assign a personal identification number, then send 
      this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of 
      a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. 
      It is your passport to seamless travel across OTOGoldMine.com, allowing 
      you to download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium 
      sites without having to fill out registration forms with information 
      you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to 
      re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>WHAT WE DO WITH THE

      address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, 
      questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and 
      announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. When you 
      order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We 
      use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that 
      time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case you 
      want to order from us again, but we don't use this information again 
      without your permission.</font></p>

      companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, 
      mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about 
      products or services, sending postal mail and processing event 
      registration. We will only provide those companies the information they 
      need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that 
      information for any other purpose.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">"Kanishka Infocom Private
