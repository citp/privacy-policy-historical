#### Uses of Information

We may make the email addresses of our users available to other organizations whose products or services we think you may find interesting. If you supply us with your postal address online or we receive it through one of our relationships, you may, receive mailings from other third party companies. These third party companies may use the information that you provide to OtherInbox or OtherInbox receives from other sources to deliver you mailings with offers about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We use a third party company to distribute our offers.

Except as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared.

From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the interests of our users. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly.

Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or email address with a partner company will be done only with your permission.

OtherInbox reserves the right to disclose information when required by law.

We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

OtherInbox uses customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about OtherInbox and promotional material from some of OtherInbox's partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. OtherInbox may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the visitor's experience on OtherInbox's site, show the visitor content that OtherInbox thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with advertisers ONLY on an aggregate basis.
