## The Organization Collecting Information at This Website

The mission of Return Path and its subsidiary companies is to make email better for everyone. We build products and provide services to make your inbox a safe and manageable place filled with email you want to receive and nothing more.

The products and services of Return Path, Inc. and its subsidiaries include Context.IO, OtherInbox, and Shopami.com. We operate and own the websites (the “Sites”) located at:

  * [http://context.io](http://context.io/)
  * [http://www.otherinbox.com](http://www.otherinbox.com/)
  * [http://www.shopami.com](http://www.shopami.com/)
  * [http://www.whiskerwidget.com](http://www.whiskerwidget.com/)
  * [http://www.getunsubscriber.com](http://www.getunsubscriber.com/)
  * [http://getorganizer.com](https://www.otherinbox.com/organizer/)



Through these Sites, we provide various email management and information products and services through which users who register with us may analyze and manage email messages received and better understand relevant data such as purchase and other information from their email stored in their personal email accounts.

## The Information We Collect and Use

We refer to the above products and services, as well as any of our other current or future products and services, collectively as the “Service.” Any information provided to us through the Service will be retained and used for the purposes of fulfilling your request for information, fulfilling a request through a Site or Service feature, performing and carrying out the Terms of the Service, performing or improving our Service, developing a new Service, communicating with you as a user of Return Path’s services or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

## Registration Information

Registration for the Service may not required to simply view a Site. If you elect to register for a Service, Return Path asks you for information that enables us to provide the Service. You will be registering with Return Path on the form provided and such registration may require you to provide contact information such as your name, username, password, and email address.

## Service Usage Information

We collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual – and personal information automatically when you access and use the Service. For example, when you use the Service, we may collect data from and about the commercial electronic mail messages, transactional or relationship messages that are sent to your email accounts so that we can better understand the behavior of the senders of such messages, develop anonymized data products from your email messages and interactions (“anonymized data products”), as well as better understand our customer behavior to improve our products, services, and advertising. If we do disclose such messages, all identifiable personal information will be removed or obfuscated prior to any such disclosure. If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information, including anonymized data products, for any purpose.

The services Return Path offers are:

### Context.IO

#### Developers

The Context.IO Developer Terms of Service contain some specific obligations applicable to you regarding your privacy and data practices. These obligations include things such as ensuring that you are publishing a sufficient privacy policy to your End Users, that it is available to your users for review in a sufficient manner, and that specific disclosures exist which allow for the Context.IO Services to be utilized within your mobile or web product or service, and data to be shared with Return Path. If you are a developer and have powered your mobile or email application with Context.IO, please review your [Developer Terms of Service](http://context.io/terms-of-service).

#### Service End-Users

If you are an email user using a third party mobile or email application powered by Context.IO, then with your permission at sign up or use of the application, Return Path and Context.IO collect personal information from you and your email accounts that are connected to Context.IO. This includes but is not limited to your name, email address, username and password. Context.IO may also collect personal information from visitors when they communicate with us about our services and products or during other transactions or interactions. Context.IO will use personal information to provide services and products requested by you, to enable its vendors and contractors to provide and assist Context.IO in the marketing and provision of such services and products to you, or to develop anonymized data products. We also use your information to improve spam filters, detect and help stop phishing attacks, help companies adopt best practices, and analyze how people interact with commercial email. You may opt out of sharing information with Context.IO at any time by going to http://optout.context.io or to marketing communications sent by Context.IO via the opt-out link contained in the communications.

### OtherInbox

With your permission, Return Path connects your email account(s) to one or more applications developed and operated by OtherInbox. Our OtherInbox applications provide a service whereby our servers scan your mailbox to inventory, organize and categorize email and/or to assist in unsubscribing from selected senders. As part of that process, we index information about commercial email companies who have sent you email. For example, we index information like FROM domain, FROM IP Address, Message Subject line, Message Date, and Message Body URLs. We retain data from these commercial messages, about the commercial sender, including their name and reply email address, Message Subject line, and message content and unsubscribe link (if present). We also retain user usage data points, including whether the email was opened, moved, forwarded, clicked, or marked as spam. We use this collected information, including personal information, to operate or improve the Service, to develop new services, features or applications and to develop anonymized data products.

### Return Path Consumer Applications

With your permission, our Consumer Applications (Shopami, Whisker Widget, Organizer, and Unsubscriber), connect to your email account(s) that you choose in order to provide you services such as indexing coupons, offers and promotions from your inbox and helping you manage your preferences for commercial emails. When you connect your email accounts to our Consumer Applications, Our servers scan your mailbox and store information, including personal information, in order to help us provide services to you, improve or develop new services, features or applications and to develop anonymized data products. We may retain message level information (like what’s described above in our OtherInbox product) as well as your location data (e.g., when you use a location-enabled feature in Shopami, we may collect and process information about your location), device information (such as product model, operating system and the device identifier or “UDID”), log information (such as device event information, system activity, hardware settings, internet protocol address, and details of how you used our services). If you do not want us to collect or use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for Shopami located in your account settings on your mobile device and or within the Shopami application itself. If you choose not to share your location information, then certain features may be limited or unavailable.

## Aggregate Information

From time to time, we may collect general, non-identifiable personal, statistical information about the use of the Sites and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as “cookies” and “IP addresses”, which are discussed in greater detail below. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Sites and Service to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties (such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)), or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you, other list members or any other visitors to the Sites.

We may store your personal information along with your files and data on a third party server such as Amazon Web Services; or we may use a third party analytics tool to learn how you are using our Sites.

At any time, you can disable location services on your personal device (generally in your devices “account settings”), and we will no longer have access to your location information.

### Mobile Analytics

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link this information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.

## Profile

We store information that we collect through cookies and clear gifs to create a “profile” of your preferences. We tie your personal information to information in the profile to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers or to improve the content of the Sites for you.

Details will be used only by our staff and/or approved agents to support the necessary terms and conditions for use of service such as service providers under contract who help with our business operations and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.

## Retention of Personal Information

When we collect your personal information (including geo-location data), we will retain it as long as your account in the relevant Service remains enabled, unless applicable law requires otherwise. However, we will make good faith efforts to delete your personal information if you contact us by following the instructions at the beginning and at the end of this Privacy Policy, provided that we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact the Return Path Privacy Office by emailing us at [privacy@returnpath.com](mailto:privacy@returnpath.com).

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Except for the limited situations listed here in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your identifiable personal information with unapproved third parties. To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to unapproved third parties as part of legal process.

## Agents and Third Party Service Providers

To provide the Service to you, we may sometimes use approved third party businesses or individuals to perform certain specialized services such as data processing, analysis or other technology services. Return Path may transfer personal information that we collect about you to affiliated entities or to other trusted third parties to perform services for us, including to help us develop anonymized data products. These entities are not permitted to retain or use your information for any other purpose other than to perform work for us.

## Where your Information is Processed

Return Path and many of its service providers are based in the United States. Return Path and its service providers may also maintain data processing facilities outside of the United States. If you use the Service, please be aware that your information will be transferred to, processed, and used in the United States and other countries where we and our service providers maintain data processing facilities. If you are located in the European Union, Switzerland or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including your personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Return Path or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Change of Control / Asset Transfer

As the Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell all or parts of our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that the assets of the Company in whole or in parts are acquired by a third-party, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Sites or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets. In the event of a corporate change in control or sale of all or parts of our business assets our users will be notified in accordance with the “Changes to this Policy” section of the policy if their personal information is provided to the new corporate entity or asset purchaser.

## Legal Compliance

As we stated, Return Path values our relationships with our Users and are committed to respecting and protecting your Usage Information. Return Path can however disclose Users’ Usage Information for legal or regulatory reasons, including in response to subpoenas, bankruptcy proceedings, and court orders. Return Path can also use Usage Information to investigate fraud and to prevent violation of our Terms of Service and unlawful use of our network, services and other Users.

Return Path also reserves the right to disclose member information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Return Path’s rights or property, other visitors, list members, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Return Path also reserves the right to disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
