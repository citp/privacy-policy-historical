    <div class="readMode">
      <p>Welcome to the website of MQL4.community!</p>
      <p>Here you can familiarize yourself with our Privacy
        Policy regarding any personal information you provide via www.mql4.com. We are committed
        to safeguarding your personal data and information that you entrust to us via the
        Internet.</p>

      <p>By accessing and using this website, you are deemed to accept and be bound by this
        Privacy Policy, as well as <a target="_blank" href="/en/about/terms">this website's Terms of Use</a>.</p>
      <p>This website is not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly
        collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 on this website.
        If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from
        a visitor under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>
      <h3>1. Links to Other Websites</h3>
      <div class="point">
        <p>This Privacy Policy only covers information collected on this website. This website
          may contain links to other websites which are not owned or controlled by us. We
          are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. You should
          always be aware of this when you leave this website and we encourage you to read
          the privacy statements of each website you visit which collects personal information.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>2. Protection of Personal Information</h3>
      <div class="point">
        <p>Collection of Personal Information. We collect your personal information, including
          information that you provide when you register on www.mql4.com or associated services
          available on www.mql4.com, email us or subscribe to our website newsletters.
          "Personal information" is any data that can be used to uniquely identify a person,
          such as name, email address, phone number or credit card information.</p>
        <p>Use of Personal Information. We use personal information provided to us electronically
          via our website to, inter alia, register users, administer and improve our website
          and associated services, to analyze the website statistics and the effectiveness
          of the terms of use, as well as for other purposes approved by you. We also use
          your personal information to communicate with you in other ways. For example, if
          you contact us via the website, we may use your personal information to respond.
          We may also use personal information to advise you of any material changes to this
          Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>From time to time, we may offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users
          which we use to obtain additional information. Participation in such surveys and
          subscription lists is completely voluntary so the website user has a choice whether
          or not to disclose any requested information. In addition to other purposes set
          out in this Privacy Policy, contact details collected in connection with surveys
          and questionnaires are used to mail you questionnaire and survey reports, as well
          as to monitor or improve the effectiveness of, and user satisfaction with, this
          website.</p>
        <p>Disclosure of Personal Information. We hire other companies or work in association
          with companies that provide services on our behalf, such as handling the processing
          and delivery of communications, hosting this website, delivery of content and services
          provided by this website, or performing statistical analysis. We may disclose personal
          information to those service providers in order to permit the efficient delivery
          of their services but they will be permitted to obtain only the personal information
          they need to deliver the service. They are obliged to maintain the confidentiality
          of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose your personal information
          in your profile, on forums and comments to publications, it becomes publicly available
          and can be viewed by other users.</p>
        <p>We may also use or disclose personal information about you for other purposes, including
          cases when we deem it necessary and appropriate in order to comply with the law
          or respond to lawful requests or legal process, to protect our rights, property,
          or personal security of our website users or the general public, to enforce our
          website's Terms of Use or other agreements, to investigate or take actions against
          illegal or suspected illegal activities, or in relation with a corporate transaction
          such as a demerger, merger, consolidation, sale of assets, or in the unlikely event
          of bankruptcy, or otherwise, as you may consent.</p>
        <p>We may disclose the content of communications, messages and emails but we will not
          post or publish any personal information, and such information will not be shared
          with any third-party service providers without your consent, except as specified
          in this Privacy Policy. We will not sell, rent or lease our mailing lists to any
          third parties.</p>
        <p>Access to Personal Information. If at any time after giving your personal information
          on this website you decide that you do not wish us to hold or use your Personal
          Information for any purpose, you can remove yourself from www.mql4.com user list
          by deleting your account or contacting us by email at support@mql5.com.</p>
        <p>Children's Privacy. We recognize the importance of protecting the information about
          children. Our website is directed to the general public and we do not knowingly
          collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If and when
          age information is requested on our website, the website automatically blocks the
          receipt of any personal information from any user whose age is specified as being
          under 13 and rejects further registration of any such user as a website user.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>3. Non-Personal Information Policy</h3>
      <div class="point">
        <p>Our Non-Personal Information Practices. We may collect non-personal information
          about your visit to our website, including pages you have viewed, links you have
          clicked, as well as other actions related to your use of our website. Additionally,
          we may collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website
          you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and
          referring website addresses.</p>
        <p>Cookies. Cookies are small text files containing a string of numbers and letters
          that are placed on your hard disk every time you visit a certain webpage. These
          files allow to identify your browser when you visit the same website again. Cookies
          can store user settings and other information. You can set your browser to reject
          all cookies or to notify you when you receive a cookie. Please note however that
          some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Any
          data collected in this manner cannot be used to individually identify website users.
          Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p>
        <p>We use cookies to control the use of our website, collect non-personal information
          about our users, store your preferences and other information on your computer in
          order to save your time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information
          and to display your personalized content on your later visits to our website. This
          information is also used for statistical analysis to tailor content to usage patterns.</p>
        <p>Aggregate Data. We may combine personal information we collect from you with personal
          information provided by other users, in a non-identifiable format, thus creating
          aggregate data. We plan to analyze aggregate data mainly to identify group trends.
          We do not link aggregate user data with personal information and aggregate data
          can therefore not be used to contact or identify you. We will use user names instead
          of actual names when creating and analyzing aggregate data. For statistical purposes
          and tracking group trends, anonymous aggregate data may be shared with other companies
          with which we have relationships.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy.</h3>
      <div class="point">
        <p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in part or
          in full. We encourage you to check our Privacy Policy from time to time to keep
          yourselves updated with the measures we take to protect your personal information.
          To view the latest version of our Privacy Policy, click on the &lt;Privacy Policy&gt;
          link at the foot of our home page. Often, when changes are made to this Privacy
          Policy, we also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the Privacy Policy
          but we may not always give other notices of changes. If we make a change to this
          policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you thereof by
          placing a prominent preliminary notice or by directly sending you a notification
          to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use
          the website after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
          Privacy Policy.</p>
