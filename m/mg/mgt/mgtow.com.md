# Privacy Policy | MGTOW

## Privacy

For your peace of mind, we would like to ensure that **under no circumstances** will your email or contact information be shared with (or distributed to) anyone. Your privacy is extremely important, and we’re not kidding.

Registering with mgtow.com requires an email address as the only unique & reliable identifier for our users.  
You are not required or encouraged to use your real name, nor submit any other personal information, address or phone number.

Users may voluntarily enter their city (or country) on their profile card to let other users know where they are located – purely for interests sake and no other reason. It is nice to know when someone is from another country so that we may translate our communications into their native language. We strongly encourage an international community as we are multi-lingual ourselves.

Naturally, some basic and general information (such as browser type, mobile / computer device type, and IP address etc.) will be logged along with any submissions for visitors & statistic purposes, and these are essential for gaining a general knowledge of our audience. 

## Security

Beginning 2015.08.16, we are very pleased to have made a significant move to __HTTPS for 256-bit verified secure encrypted communications so that you may visit us confidently.

## Cookies

We do not store (or set) any “cookies” or store preferences in your browser from any page on our website. For logged in members, a server-side session is created for your visit and quits the moment you quit your browser. The forums have a dark/light switch (to change appearance) and this purely cosmetic preference is stored in the session for your visit.

Google uses cookies to serve advertisements. And if a forums topic is on “marriage”, you may see an ad for “foreign brides”. If a forums topic is on cars, you may see an ad for trucks – or motor oil. We have no control over the ads you may see, but we have some limited control of the ads you don’t see. So we disallow certain ad categories like medication, and jewelry.

Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit here and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/). (Alternatively, users may opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).)

## Extra note

On 2015.10.22 we began insisting on strong passwords for everyone. Every member must be able to reset their own passwords at any time – without assistance. If you have not already done so since 2015.10.22, please [reset your password right here](https://web.archive.org/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword). You will not be able to log in until you have done this. Perhaps you also changed your email since you joined, in which case, we should be notified and we will be happy to make the change. Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) if you have any difficulty.

Thank You.
