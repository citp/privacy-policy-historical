# Privacy | MGTOW

For your peace of mind, we would like to ensure that **under no circumstances** will your email be shared with (or distributed to) anyone. Your privacy is extremely important, and we’re not kidding. Since the site allows user contributions and posts, it’s strongly recommended you don’t share your email publicly when posting.

Joining only requires an email address which is the only unique & reliable identifier for our users. We ask for no other identifier. Since you are permitted to change your “display name” anytime, your login is always your original registered email. There are no “name” fields, so you are not required or encouraged to use your real name, nor submit any other personal information, address or phone number. 

We do not know your password. It is stored in an encrypted hash. You may [reset your password anytime](https://web.archive.org/password-reset/) and the previous reset limit has been lifted. We also recently removed the forcing of very strong passwords when resetting. Once you are logged in, the account/settings page permits you to change your password. 

Users may voluntarily enter their city (or country) on their profile card to let other users know where they are located – purely for interests sake and no other reason. It is nice to know when someone is from another country so that we may translate our communications into their native language. We strongly encourage an international community as we are multi-lingual ourselves.

Naturally, some basic and general information (such as browser type, device, and IP address etc.) is occasionally logged along with any submissions for visitors & statistic purposes, and these are essential for gaining a general knowledge of our audience. It also assists in debugging , depending on what browser/device you’re using.

## Security

We are very pleased to have made a significant move to __HTTPS for 256-bit verified secure encrypted communications so that you may visit us confidently. Using http **s** :// when linking to ( or referencing ) anything is always recommended.

## Cookies

We do not store (or set) any “cookies” or store preferences in your browser from any page on our website. For logged in members, a server-side session is created for your visit. For visitors, a temporary session is created. This makes it possible for you to bookmark “favorites” for later. Visitor favorites expire and are temporary. Member favorites are remembered and manageable by you.

The forums (will) have a cosmetic preference allowing you to choose and remember a display mode. “Day” or “night” mode – or other. This is stored in your profile data instead of a cookie. In all other ways, we do not use cookies for tracking or storing anything. Some 3rd party plugins may use a cookie for an express purpose, but we do not.

## Deleting Your Account

 _“Delete my account”_ is a new ability for all member levels and available on your account/settings page (top right menu). Unlike other social media websites, it is also permanent and non-reversible. Deleting your account completely removes your registered email, all user metadata, and any trace of what is on your profile. 

Account deletion attributes any existing forums posts to “anonymous” making no association to any specific member once your profile is removed. If you have intention to delete your account, it is recommended that you do not post, or make any content submissions. 

If you are a monthly subscriber (read below), it is recommended that you cancel your active subscription (if any) before deleting your account.

## Purchases, Payments and Monthly Subscriptions

For purchases, invoice payments (for clients), or monthly subscriptions, all credit card transactions are handled by [STRIPE®](https://stripe.com/) – for industry-standard, exceedingly stringent and secure transactions. For your peace of mind, no part of any credit card transaction is stored here – ever. 

While the transaction appears to take place here on our website, the communication is encrypted and strictly between the user and STRIPE (the processor). At STRIPE, our transaction record only displays the last 4 digits of your card, card type, your email, the date/time, and what you paid for. We can never know your full credit card number or other personal information. No unauthorized transactions are possible. 

Recurring monthly subscribers keep our site going. Proceeds are directly applied to monthly operational costs and our hosting & development team. We thank you very much for your support and are very grateful to those who have upgraded.

For your interest, and as of 08.2018, we have recently upgraded every aspect of the membership system to eventually automate self-management of monthly subscribers. Our “upgrade” page is being revamped for that purpose – so members can easily upgrade and cancel themselves.

Cancelations are currently handled manually and individually. We honor every subscription cancel request send to hello @ mgtow . com. We check STRIPE to compare the email your request is coming from and compare it to your registered email here. If you have an active subscription and wish to cancel, we will even refund you retroactively to your date of cancel request and send a snapshot of confirmation that your recurring subscription has been cancelled at the STRIPE processor while ensuring that your card will never be billed again.

STRIPE also has an advanced API, so we are currently testing the ability for members to easily upgrade, pause, or cancel their subscriptions direct from their own profile. This section will be amended the moment the process is fully automated and implemented.

## Your Password

We do not know your password and can never retrieve it for you. It is known only to you and stored in an encrypted hash. Registered members may request a password reset link to be emailed to you at any time via the “[password reset](https://web.archive.org/password-reset/)” page. Alternatively, changing your password is also possible via the account/settings page when logged in (top right menu).

If you require and request assistance, we can also manually regenerate and email you a new temporary password, so that you may log in and change it yourself. You may confidently know that your password is known by you alone. It is strongly recommended that you always choose a reasonably strong password for your peace of mind. There is currently no restriction as to how many times you may reset your password.

## Locked Out?

Too many consecutive invalid logins may result in a temporary block for one hour. This is a standard security precaution to deter malicious bots or other mechanisms. Do not be alarmed if you experience a lockout. We will be happy to assist. It is extremely unusual to be permanently locked out with too many invalid login requests. We regularly remove all blocks roughly once a week.

( Please note: Around 06.2018, we experienced a period of time where a bug was not permitting changing of a password. The change was not sticking causing frustration for some members who were concerned they were locked out on purpose. We would never do such a thing. This issue was permanently fixed, and confirmed, and members were then able to reset their passwords without issue. )

## No Mailing lists or Newsletters

As yet, we have never kept (or collected) a separate “mailing list” of emails, nor sent any mass newsletters out. We respect our member base and leave it to you to return to find new additions at your leisure. Site-wide announcements are made via little “broadcast notices” which you may discover once you have logged in. They are very unobtrusive and short to keep members informed and/or direct your attention when necessary. 

## Advertisements

Currently, we do not serve any advertisements. 

But in case that ever changes, Google uses cookies to serve advertisements. If a forums topic is on “marriage”, you may see an ad for “foreign brides”. If a forums topic is on cars, you may see an ad for trucks – or motor oil. We have no control over the ads you may see, but we have some limited control of the ads you don’t see. So we disallow certain ad categories like medication, kid’s clothing and jewelry (etc.).

Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit here and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/). (Alternatively, users may opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).)

Thank You.
