## IV. SECURITY 

Personal Information (including Confidential Personal Information) and Non-Personal Information collected by MGM MIRAGE, the MGM MIRAGE Web Sites and MGM MIRAGE Resorts and Casinos are stored on secure servers. The secure servers are protected by firewalls and other industry standard security measures. These security measures are instituted to ensure the protection of these secure servers from unauthorized access. However, no security system is impenetrable, and these systems could become accessible in the event of a security breach. We have controls in place that are designed to detect potential data breaches, contain and minimize the loss of data, and conduct forensic investigations of a breach. 

Our staff is required to take reasonable measures to ensure that unauthorized persons cannot view or access your Personal Information. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

We cannot enforce or control the security of the computers, electronic devices, or electronic communication method that a consumer may use to send e-mails and submit information to us over the Internet. You are responsible for ensuring that the computers, electronic devices and electronic communication methods you use will provide adequate security for communicating with us. We are not responsible for the disclosure or interception of your information before we receive it.

As a standard security practice, we will take reasonable steps which are standard in the industry to ensure that the communication methods used to support the MGM MIRAGE Web Sites do not permit connection or communication by methods that have known security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. As such, if you experience trouble using an MGM MIRAGE Web Site, it may be an indication that you need to upgrade your Internet browsing tool or application to a newer version that supports more secure communication methods. 

## V. RESPONSIBLE GAMING PROGRAM 

MGM MIRAGE is a member of the American Gaming Association and adheres to its Code of Conduct for Responsible Gaming. Accordingly, we will not use the Personal Information of members of the MGM MIRAGE Self-Limit Access Program of Nevada, Self-Exclusion Program of Mississippi, or Disassociated Persons Program of Michigan, as applicable, for any marketing purposes. 

## VI. OTHER WEB SITES 

We are not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of other web sites, including web sites operated by our Partners. You should review and understand the privacy policies posted on any linked sites you visit before providing any Personal Information.

## VII. PERSONS UNDER AGES 18 AND 21 

Certain of our areas and activities are intended for persons 21 or older. If you are under 21, we ask that you do not access or attempt to access any areas or participate in any activities that are restricted to persons 21 or older. We do not knowingly collect or allow the collection of Personal Information from persons under 18. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under 18 and believe that the person has provided us with Personal Information, you may contact us at [privacy@mgmmirage.com](mailto:privacy@mgmmirage.com) and request that it be deleted from our files. We will delete the Personal Information of any person under 18 and will not use such Personal Information for any purpose.

## VIII. VISITORS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES 

The MGM MIRAGE Web Sites are maintained on servers located in the United States, and Personal Information and Non-Personal Information are stored on computers and servers located in the United States. The United States may not offer a level of privacy protection for Personal Information (including Confidential Personal Information) as great as that offered in other jurisdictions. Therefore, the disclosure of Personal Information pursuant to this Policy is at your own risk. We make no representation that the practices described in this Policy are compliant with laws outside of the United States that apply to the collection, security, use and disclosure of Personal Information. 

## IX. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY 

We reserve the right to revise this Policy at any time without notice. When this Policy is revised in a material way, notice will be posted on the MGM MIRAGE Web Sites along with the revised Policy.
