In addition to on-site advertising, MGShareware may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide if you choose to receive such solicitations.  The user is always able to ask MGShareware not to contact them with such information again.  Users will not be included in promotions, contests, submission opportunities, solicitations or other programs unless they opt-in.  If you receive unsolicited email from a MGShareware domain, please contact our _Policy Manager_.
