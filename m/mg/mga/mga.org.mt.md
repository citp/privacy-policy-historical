# Privacy Policy - Malta Gaming Authority

The MGA is the regulatory body responsible for the governance and supervision of all gaming activities in and from Malta. It is assigned with the responsibility and official authority to ensure that Malta’s gaming regime is based on fair, responsible, safe and secure provision of gaming services and it seeks to ensure that the three main pillars of gaming, namely (i) the fairness of games, (ii) the protection of minors and vulnerable persons and (iii) the prevention of crime, fraud and money laundering, are safeguarded as much as possible.

It is therefore the duty and responsibility of the Authority to process all the data and information as may be required to effectively safeguard the public interest with regards to gaming activities in and from Malta.

When determining the purposes and means of the processing of such personal data, the MGA – whose principal place of business is situated at Building SCM 02-03, Level 4, SmartCity Malta, Ricasoli SCM1001, Malta – is acting as the ‘Data Controller’ for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

This Privacy Policy aims at giving an overview to data subjects of how the MGA deals with issues related to data protection and at informing data subjects of their rights pursuant to the GDPR. It also provides all the necessary information needed by Data Subjects to be able to request further information on issues related to data protection and privacy as may be required.

**Personal Information We Process**

The Authority may collect your personal information in accordance with the terms of this privacy notice. Personal information consists of personal data and, in some cases, may also consist of special categories of personal data. The term ‘personal data’ refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, e-mail or mailing address. Certain information may be classified as ‘special category personal data’, such as information about you that may reveal your race, ethnic origin, or political opinion. Should we require your special category personal data, we will request your explicit consent.

**Legal Protection**

The Authority is required to adhere to the Data Protection Act (Cap. 440 of the Laws of Malta) (the “Data Protection Act”) and other relevant regulations, legal notices and similar instruments that may be in force, taking account of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC) (the “Directives”) (the “Data Protection Laws”).

All this is in place in order to assure you that at all times your personal information is:

  * request access to the personal information we hold about you, in which case, and subject to Section 7 of the Privacy Policy, we will provide you with a copy of the information requested;

**Access, corrections and deletions**

If you wish to view any of your personal information we hold, or have any inaccurate data corrected or removed, you can make a request (“A Data Subject Request”) to this effect.

A data subject request shall be made by sending an email to that Authority’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) to the following email address: [dpo.mga@mga.org.mt](mailto:dpo.mga@mga.org.mt). The email shall contain your full name, address, and a description of the information you wish to view, correct or delete.

The Authority’s DPO may request further information from the data subject making the request should any clarifications be required. Furthermore, to ensure confidentiality and to verify the identity of the person making the data subject request, the DPO may request a photo to be taken of the subject person holding a photo identification document clearly showing name, identification number and facial photo on document.

It is important to note that the rights of data subjects are tied with certain conditions and limitations that are stipulated within the GDPR itself.

The Authority reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for repetitive requests, requests for further copies of the same data, and, or requests which are deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive. We may also refuse to act upon requests that are deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive.
