Protecting your privacy is a serious matter and doing so is very important to us. Please read this privacy policy statement (the "Policy") to learn more about our privacy policy. This Policy describes the information we collect from you and what may happen to that information, and only applies to such information. This Policy applies to all sites under the meetup.com domain.

  * for each topic group in which you participate, you may choose to create and store a short description or statement which will be viewed by anyone who is accessing that topic group, and your message board postings. 



In addition, we automatically track certain basic information about our users (such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, click patterns, etc.). We use this information to do internal research on our users' usage patterns, demographics, interests and general behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. We do not directly link these types of information with your personally identifiable information. For purposes of this Policy, "personally identifiable information" means any information that could be used to identify your personally (e.g., your email address) or to identify the computer with which you access our Platform.

For our users convenience, we use "cookies" to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session and to provide for an easier registration process.
