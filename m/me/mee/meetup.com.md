# Meetup : Credits

Protecting your privacy is a serious matter and doing so is very important to us. Please read this privacy policy statement (the "Policy") to learn more about our privacy policy. This Policy describes the information we collect from you and what may happen to that information. This Policy applies to all sites under the Meetup.com domain. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Meetup does not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.

1\. **Information Collection**

We collect information about you and your use of our service in order to create a better, more personalized experience for you.

You must register with our web site in order for you to be able to fully access our service. During registration, you must provide us with your e-mail address and password and, if you are located within the United States, your zip code. In addition, in order to use any topic group that is available on our site, you must register for that topic group. >During registration for a topic group, you may choose a nickname by which you will be known to other members of that topic group. If you do not assign yourself a nickname during registration for a topic group, we will automatically assign you one. In addition, with respect to each topic group that you join, we permit you to create and store a short description or statement which will be viewed by anyone who is accessing that topic group. Once you register with Meetup and sign in to use our service, you are no longer anonymous to Meetup to the extent you have provided us with this information.

We automatically track certain basic information about our users. We use this information to do internal research on your usage patterns, demographics, interests and general behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track usersÕ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not directly link these types of information (e.g., IP addresses) with your personally identifiable information. 

For our users convenience, we use "cookies" to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session and to provide for an easier registration process. A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on your computer that is tied to information about you. We do not use cookies for any other purpose (for example, we do not use cookies to monitor your activities or otherwise track information about you). If you configure your browser or otherwise choose to reject the cookies, you may still use our site. However, to best experience our web site and most easily use our service you must have cookies enabled. 

Also, if you post messages in message areas (including the personal introduction section of each topic group) on our web site, send us personal correspondence, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our web site, we may collect such information and include it in your profile. Your profile is not accessible to other users or third parties other than Meetup personnel.

2\. **Use of Information**

We use (and you agree that we may so use) the information we collect about you (including your personally identifiable information) to create a better, more personalized experience for you based on your individual usage habits, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our siteÕs content, layout and services. These uses improve our site and allow us to better customize it to meet your needs. We also use (and you agree that we may so use) the information we collect about you to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our Terms of Service Agreement. 

You also agree that we may compile the information we collect about you and use it, **in an aggregate form only** , in the negotiation and establishment of service agreements with public and/or private enterprises under which such enterprises will serve as venues for meetings between our users ("meetups"). 

You also agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as topic group newsletters or meetup announcements (which also may include promotional communications), administrative notices, product or service offerings, and other communications relevant to your use of our service. 

You also agree that we may use for promotional, sales, or any use that we consider appropriate your correspondence with us, be it via e-mail, postings on our web site, or feedback via the user polls. 

3\. **Disclosure of Your Information**

**Except as may be set forth in this section 3, we DO NOT sell, rent or otherwise share your personally identifiable information with other third parties.** Instead, to the extent we share information with our partners and advertisers, we share only aggregated information that is not linked to your personally identifiable information. Aggregated information that we may share with our marketing partners includes, but is not limited to, information showing the relative popularity of one meetup venue over another (for example, the number of individuals present at a meetup).

**Required disclosures**. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose your personal information when required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site, (b) enforce this Statement or the Terms of Service Agreement, (c) respond to claims that your Personal Information violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Meetup, its users and the public. You authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability. 

**Venue providers; Advertisers**. We aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to (1) public and/or private enterprises who may or do serve as venues for meetups in order to enable us to negotiate and establish service agreements with such enterprises under which the enterprises will serve as venues for meetups, and (2) to other third parties, including advertisers, for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations we do not disclose to these third parties any information that could be used to identify you personally (for example, we never disclose your e-mail address to such third parties).

**Business transitions**. In the event that Meetup goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, usersÕ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via e-mail and/or prominent notice on our web site for at least fifteen (15) days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the usersÕ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choices consistent with Section 8 ("Notification of Changes").

4\. **Communications from Us**

We will send you a welcoming e-mail to verify your e-mail address. You will occasionally receive other information from us (see below). 

_Topic group newsletters and meetup notifications_. If you are a member of a topic group, you will receive periodic notifications from us of upcoming meetups and other information relevant to topic group members. >These notifications may include promotional communications. You may not opt-out of these communications while you are a member of that topic group, but you may end your membership in that group at any time. 

_Service announcements_. On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send you an e-mail. You may not opt-out of these communications, though you can deactivate your account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

_Customer service_. We communicate with you on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to your account we reply via e-mail or phone, in accordance with your wishes. >You may not opt-out of these communications, though you can deactivate your account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

5. **Other Parties; Links**

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Policy, this Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.

Our web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Meetup is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our web site. 

6\. **Security**

Meetup uses industry standard network security practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. We treat our data (including your personally identifiable information) as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. However, it is impossible for us to provide our service using the internet and simultaneously ensure perfect security of our data. 

7\. **Reviewing, Updating, Deleting and Deactivating Personal Information**

After registration for our service and for specific topic groups, we provide a way to correct, update, or delete/deactivate your personally identifiable information, for example:

-to change your nickname or password;

-to change your e-mail or zip code;

-to join or leave particular topic groups;

-to change your personal introduction for particular topic groups;

-to otherwise update your personal information; or

-to deactivate your account.

Upon your request, we will deactivate your account and remove your personally identifiable information from our active databases. To make this request, e-mail [privacy@meetup.com](mailto:privacy@meetup.com). Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law.

Nonetheless, we will retain in our files information you may have requested us to remove if, in our discretion, retention of the information is necessary to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or to enforce the Terms of Service Agreement. Furthermore, your information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints (for example, we will not remove your information from our back up storage). 

8\. **Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change this Policy, we will post those changes on <http://www.meetup.com/privacy> or post a notice of the changes to this Policy on the homepage ([http://www.meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/)) and other places we deem appropriate, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy statement under which the information was collected. 

If we make any material changes in our privacy practices, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying you and our other users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also e-mail you and other users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. >However, if you have deleted/deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted, nor will your previously collected personal information be used in this new manner.

All changes to this Policy are effective after we provide you with at least thirty (30) days notice of the changes and provide notice of the changes as described above. You must notify us within this 30 day period if you do not agree to the changes to the Policy and wish to deactivate your account as provided under Section 7.

9\. **Dispute Resolution**

Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Policy or previous privacy policy statements shall be resolved through negotiation, mediation and arbitration as provided under our Terms of Service Agreement.
