We also believe it is important to inform you about how we will use your personal data, and to give you choices about how those data will be used. Therefore, we encourage you to read this Privacy Notice carefully, before you make your choices and give us the right to use your information.</p>
<h3>Scope of this Privacy Notice</h3>
<p>This privacy notice ("Privacy Notice") applies to all personal data of consumers collected via the use of the Hue lamps and bridge (“Products”), www.meethue.com (“Web Site”) and the Hue application (“App”), that are controlled by or under the control of Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. or any of its subsidiaries (”Philips”)</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice applies in addition to any terms and conditions and other policies of Philips for the Products, Web Site and App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why should you share your personal data with Philips?&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Philips we use best in class data security tools to keep your data safe and protect hue from unauthorized access. We will never share your personally identifiable information with the third parties without asking your permission, unless as stated in the Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>Sharing your personal data with us enables us to offer you a number of benefits. It will make it easier and more convenient for you to:</p>
<p>•Enable the control of your hue lamps via WIFI networks outside your home:</p>
<p>oSee the status of the lamps in your home;</p>
<p>oSynchronize your settings across multiple devices;</p>
<p>oRemotely manage the configuration of your system;</p>
<p>oBenefit from software updates</p>
<p>oAny other options the Hue application might offer you in the future, such as being able to track your usage of hue lights</p>
<p>•Use other applications and functionality made available via the Web Site.</p>
<p>•Communicate in a personal and timely manner, such as responding to your request for contact &nbsp;or, if you choose to receive such information, to inform you about Philips products and services;</p>
<p>•Register your purchase so you can receive all the benefits to which your purchase entitles you;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•Request information specific to your interests;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•Participate in online communities;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•Receive personalized messages and special offers that are relevant to your interests;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•Save time by storing your preferences;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will also allow us further develop the Product, add more functionality and/or improve the Services including the Web Site and Applications by applying analysis and researches on aggregated data where there will be no personally identifiable information</p>
<h3>Who is responsible for your information?</h3>
<p>Philips Lighting B.V. is the entity that controls the Hue Pages and is responsible for the collection and processing of personal data via the Hue Pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How we collect your personal data and which personal data we collect</p>
<p>You can share your personal data with us in a number of ways, for instance by:</p>
<p>•creating an account on www.meethue.com</p>
<p>•using the Web Site or App to access or modify your settings or to upload scenes or images</p>
<p>•subscribing to a newsletter; or</p>
<p>•completing a registration form via the Web Site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to register and create a Hue account Philips will collect and store personal information of you. We will collect and store: email address, password, nickname, usage data, scenes and images you choose to upload.</p>
<h3>Do we collect additional data from you when using the Products or connecting your Product to the internet?</h3>
<p>In order to improve your experience and help troubleshoot any problem that may arise, we collect additional technical information such as the serial number of the lamps and the bridge, software version. To be able to use the Services, hue needs to be connected to your Wi-Fi network. During the set-up, hue will save your IP address so that it can communicate with the hue servers and download software updates.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you create a Hue Account we will store your usage data to be able to let you monitor your light usage as well as add more functionality to the Services in the future such as being able to monitor your energy usage. We anonymize all of this data and there is no way for us to link this data back to a user’s personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Sharing information</h3>
<p>We want to know you better so we can serve you better. But the choice of whether you want this kind of service is up to you. If you do not want to share your personal information with us you will not be able to create a Hue account and thus you cannot control the Products outside of your home.</p>
<p>You should know that your personal data may be transferred from your home country to other Philips companies around the world, who may communicate with you about our products or special offers you may find useful. If you do not want us to send you personalized offers or information, you can let us know by checking the appropriate box on the registration form. Philips will only share your data with third parties outside Philips in the following circumstances: Sometimes Philips sells you a product or offers you a service in a joint marketing effort with other companies. In such cases, your personal data will be shared with these companies. We will always let you know that such relationship exists and who these companies are prior to your registration. Note that these companies often have their own privacy policies that apply to the way they use your personal data. These privacy policies sometimes differ from the Philips Notice. Philips sometimes uses outside companies for handling your purchase or request or for processing your data. Philips requires these companies to adequately safeguard your personal data and not use your data for any other purpose not authorized by Philips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Philips works with Google to be able to provide you the service. Also Google shall not use your data for&nbsp;any other purpose than authorized by Philips and to your data shared with Google the Google Privacy Policy shall be applicable. This policy can be found at: http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/policies/privacy/. By using the Products, Web Site and App you consent to the use by Google of your personally identifiable data needed for the service, and the applicability thereto of the Google Privacy Policy and of the European Privacy Directive (Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data)</p>
<p>Philips sometimes sells a business to another company. Such transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the buyer. Philips will release personal data information if compelled by law. Philips will not sell or provide your personal data to other third parties allowing them to use your personal data for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Philips will not share any personal financial information you provide (such as credit card information) with other parties unless this is needed to handle your order, process our invoice, or prevent or combat fraud.</p>
