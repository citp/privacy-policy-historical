		The Site may collect certain anonymous information about your visit,
		such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol
		(IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time
		you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the
		Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our
		site. None of this information is personally-identifiable. This anonymous
		information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.

		MeetCam may disclose personal information if required to do so by
		law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform
		to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served to MeetCam,
		or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of MeetCam
		and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect
		the personal safety of MeetCam employees, users of MeetCam products

	<p>
		Personal information collected
		on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other

		the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security
		technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information
		from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the
		personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access
		that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit
		sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the
		Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure
		Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cookies: We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration

		the registration process, and is not placed on your hard drive unless
		you specify you wish to "log on automatically."

		Use of Web Beacons: Pages on the Site may contain electronic images known
		as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow the Site
		to count users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons
		in promotional e-mail messages in order to count how many messages have
		been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personal
		information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics
		about Site usage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie
		number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on
		which the Web beacon resides.

		collected on the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices
		or the content of other Web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you
		are leaving this Site and read the privacy statements of each and every
		Web site that you visit before providing any personally identifiable information.
	</p>

		Changes to This Privacy Statement: We may occasionally update this privacy
		statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this
		privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice
		on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification.
		We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay
		informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect.

		statement and any updates.
