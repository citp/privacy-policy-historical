		such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol
		(IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time
		you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the

		- Understand feature requirements for our services.<br>
		- Send updates about our services.
	</p>
	<p>
		MeetCam may disclose personal information if required to do so by
		law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform
		to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served to MeetCam,
		or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of MeetCam
		and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect
		the personal safety of MeetCam employees, users of MeetCam products
		or services, or members of the public.
	</p>
	<p>
		Personal information collected
		on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other

	<p>
		Control of your Personal Information: Except as otherwise described in

		technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information
		from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the
		personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access
		that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit
		sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the
		Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure
		Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
	</p>
	<p>

		you specify you wish to "log on automatically."
	</p>
	<p>
		Use of Web Beacons: Pages on the Site may contain electronic images known
		as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow the Site
		to count users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons
		in promotional e-mail messages in order to count how many messages have
		been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personal
		information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics
		about Site usage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie
		number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on
		which the Web beacon resides.

		statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this
		privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice
		on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification.
		We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay
