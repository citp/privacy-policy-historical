This privacy policy applies to the following websites: match.com, matchaffinity.com, datingdirect.com, datingdirectaffinity.com and meetic.co.uk (the "Meetic Group Websites").

The terms ‘us’, ‘we’, ‘our’ refers to Match.com International Limited and/or DatingDirect.com Limited, as defined under the applicable terms and conditions, and operating the Meetic Group Websites.

We uphold the strictest of standards with respect to protection of privacy and of personal information, and have made a notification to the UK Information Commissioner, under the no. Z9164413. Our technical teams do their utmost to ensure the safety of our sites. Internet security is a complex issue and no system can be considered 100% secure. Should a security breach occur we will endeavour to act as fast as possible to remedy the problem.

Some information, comments or content (e.g. photographs, video, profile, lifestyle) that the Member optionally provides may possibly, under the responsibility and on the initiative of the Member concerned, reveal the ethnic origin of the Member, his/her nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation. By providing such optional information, the Member concerned confirms his/her intention and, consequently, expressly consents to, and takes sole responsibility for, the processing of this mentioned "sensitive" data by us and our group companies (by which we mean us, any of our parent companies, and any subsidiaries of us or our parent company), and their service providers located within and outside of the European Union (herein, the "Meetic Group").

Each Member can access or request access to information concerning him/her in order to have it modified, deleted or to forbid any further use by us of it. Members can submit such requests for access by mailing their requests to the following address: Match.com International Limited – PO Box 64197, London, WC1A 9FG, UK or by filling out the contact forms, and each Member shall carefully identify the sender's personal information. Similar rights granted by the other companies of the Meetic Group may be exercised through the "My account" section or by addressing directly to the relevant entity at its postal address.

With regards to the Match or DatingDirect Affinity Test, the mandatory aspect of each answer will be specified for each question. The very nature of the Match or DatingDirect Affinity Service requires a majority of answers in order to be effective.

Each Member can, at the time of registration or at any time thereafter, request to receive and, subsequently, request without charge via the applicable Meetic Group Website to cease to receive, our newsletters and/or promotional offers sent to her/him by email or to mobile phone from the Meetic Group and/or its partners.
