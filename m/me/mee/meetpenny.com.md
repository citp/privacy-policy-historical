# Privacy Policy - Meet Penny

**If you love legal writing, keep scrolling down. If you prefer human-speak, this section of the Privacy Policy is for you…**

I hate spam. My inbox is constantly full and the last thing I want is useless junk.

I also hate to sign up for one thing and get something completely different. Makes me angry.

So, my commitment to you is simple… I will not send you irrelevant emails.

## What you can expect to receive as a Meet Penny email subscriber

All of the posts to Meet Penny automatically populate an email newsletter that will land in your inbox up to five times a week. This email will keep you up-to-date with the deals, freebies, and encouragement I have shared on the blog. Essentially, it is all the information from Meet Penny delivered to make your time online more efficient.

**Special offers from my sponsors**

You might also receive special offers that I have hand-picked from companies I trust. These are paid placements to help me pay the bills but I keep tight control on what passes through to my email subscribers because you are valuable to me.

**Goodies for subscribers**

As a reward to the faithful followers of Meet Penny, I offer subscriber-only free printables and ebooks. These offers are subject to change at any time with a new freebie available every 1 to 3 months.

If you missed a freebie or failed to save it for later, I’m sorry! These printable packs and ebooks are available for purchase through [my store](http://www.meetpenny.com/shop).

**What I will NEVER do**

You have my promise that I will NEVER…

  * sell your email address to anyone, no matter how much money they offer me or how important I think they are. If I plan to provide someone with your email address, I will ask you first.
  * send you an offer that is a scam. If one slips through the cracks, you can beat me with a wet noodle, but I promise that I do my very best to only send you REAL offers with no hoops to jump through or clanging bells and whistles.
  * fill your inbox with irrelevant junk mail. Every offer will maintain the high-quality standards that compromise the posts at Meet Penny.
