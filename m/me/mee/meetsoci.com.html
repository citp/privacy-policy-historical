<p style="margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:24pt;color:#748c42">Privacy Policy</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Effective May 29, 2012</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") covers SOCI, Inc. and 
MeetSOCI.com ("MeetSOCI.com", "we", "us", 
or "our") and describes the types of information we gather 
from people visiting meetSOCI.com (the "Site") and from individual 
users interacting with the applications we provide to third parties, 
and how we use such information. We understand the importance of privacy 
and accordingly, treat all information received in a responsible manner. 
By accessing the Site or interacting with our applications, you agree 
to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this 
Policy, please do not use the Site, our applications or our services. 
Each time you use the Site, applications or services, the current version 
of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Site, 
applications or services, you should check the date of this Policy (which 
appears at the top) and review any changes since the last version.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Types Of Information We Collect</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">MeetSOCI.com may collect two types of information from users of our 
Site: "personal information" which is information that can 
be used to locate, contact, or determine your or your business's specific 
identity (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, 
etc.) and "aggregate information" which is information about 
your or your business's activities on the Site or in connection with 
the services that cannot be used to identify, locate, or contact you 
or your business (such as frequency of visits to the Site, data entered 
when using the Site, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type, 
etc.).</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Collecting Your Personal Information</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">MeetSOCI.com collects personal information that is voluntarily provided 
when a user on our Site signs up for a price quote, or for an account 
on our site, or uses one or more of our services. Specifically, when 
you sign up for an account, we ask you for your name, email address, 
and business information, among other information, and when you use 
some of our services including completing some of our templates, you 
may give us certain information about your business including address, 
telephone numbers, and other information. MeetSOCI.com also collects 
and stores information about our customer's users when customer's user 
responds to a customer offer displayed through the Facebook tab or app 
and submits personal information about him or herself. This personal 
information is gathered principally by our customers (through our services) 
for their own purposes and subject to our customer's particular privacy 
policy and our privacy. When our customers' users submit information 
through our services the information is co-owned by us and our customer 
and the user information is subject to this Policy and our customer's 
applicable privacy policy. We make no representation or warranty about 
our customers' privacy policies, so if you are submitting information 
to one of our customers through our services, you should review and 
understand that customer's privacy policy before providing your information 
to them and us.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Collecting Your Aggregate Information</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">Aggregate information is collected as you visit our Site or interact 
with our services even if you do not enter any information. Generally, 
aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single 
person can be identified by that compiled information. MeetSOCI.com 
uses aggregate information to provide its services and remuneration, 
as well as to determine the use of our Site and to monitor, audit and 
analyze information pertaining to our business metrics.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Sharing, Selling and Trading of Your Personal Information 
with Third Parties</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">MeetSOCI.com on occasion, may share personal information with third 
party service providers as we deem necessary for the third party to 
fulfill their duties, such as fulfilling orders, processing credit card 
payments, or other functions necessary to our business. These third 
party service providers are not authorized to retain, share, store or 
use your personal information for any purposes other than to provide 
the services for which they have been hired to provide. When you submit 
your personal information, you also agree that we may use your personal 
information to contact you by email, telephone, cell phone, direct mail, 
or text message about certain offers made available by us or third parties 
that we believe you might be interested in based on information you 
have provided to us. We do not sell, trade or otherwise share your personal 
information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes, 
however, we may market certain offers to you on behalf of third parties 
we determine you might be interested in.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">We use your personal and aggregate information in an effort to improve 
your experience on the Site and with the services, and to communicate 
with you about information that you request. We may also use this information 
to help us target specific services or offers to you, to help us develop 
and improve the Site and services, and to tailor our Site and services 
to your interests.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Sharing, Selling and Trading Aggregate Information 
Collected Online with Third Parties</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">We may use aggregate information to improve the Site and services, 
to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general 
business purposes. We may disclose aggregate information to third parties 
for a variety of business reasons, including to advertisers to inform 
them of the usage habits or characteristics of the interested audience, 
and to potential investors so that they may better understand our user 
base, etc. Aggregate information will not include any personal information 
and we will not disclose any personal information except as expressly 
stated elsewhere in this Policy.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Other Instances When We Share Your Information</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">In addition to the foregoing, MeetSOCI.com may elect to share or transfer 
your personal information to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply 
with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal 
process served on MeetSOCI.com, (ii) to investigate a possible crime, 
such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, 
purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of MeetSOCI.com; 
(iv) when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, 
or safety of MeetSOCI.com or other persons, or (v) as otherwise required 
or permitted by law. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><a name="0.2__GoBack"></a><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Cookies</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">If you do not provide us any of your personal information, we are 
limited in the information we may collect from you. For example, we 
may be able to determine your IP address for the purposes of administering 
the Site and tracking Site usage. However, your IP address may vary 
each time you visit or it may remain the same depending on the type 
of Internet connection you are using or the location from which you 
access the Site. We may also collect information about the websites 
that directed you to the Site after you clicked on a text or banner 
link or an ad from another website, or the day and time you visited 
the Site and how long you spent on the Site. We aggregate such information 
to help us to compile reports as to trends and other behavior about 
users visiting our Site; however such information is anonymous and cannot 
be tied directly to you.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">We may also use "cookies" and your personal information 
to enhance your experience on the Site and with the Services and to 
provide you with personalized offers. A cookie is a small data file 
placed on your computer's hard drive that contains information that 
allows us to track your activity on the Site. The cookie itself does 
not contain any personal information; however, if you provide us any 
personal information the cookie may act as an identifier to tie your 
personal information to your IP address or computer. You may choose 
to delete cookies from your computer's hard drive at anytime or to disable 
cookies on your computer. If you delete cookies that relate to the Site, 
we may not be able to identify you upon your return to the Site. Additionally, 
if you disable your computer's cookies, you may not be able to access 
certain features of the Site or services that require that cookies be 
enabled. The Site's cookies cannot be used to read data from your hard 
drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created

better, more personalized user experience on the Site. We also share 
website usage information about our Site with those interested in running 
targeted promotional campaigns on the Site. For this purpose, we and 
our advertisers track some of the pages that you visit on the Site through 
the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Security Pertaining to Your Information</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized 
access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. 
These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing 
practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures 
to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal 
data.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">We restrict access to personal information to MeetSOCI.com employees, 
service providers and agents who need to know that information in order 
to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound 
by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including 
termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 
We use secure socket layer ("SSL") technology to encrypt and 
protect the security of your personal information, including but not 
limited to your credit card number, when it is sent over the Internet. 
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic 
storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to protect 
your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Integrity of Your Data</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">MeetSOCI.com processes personal information only for the purposes 
for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy. We review 
our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that 
we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to 
provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure 
that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and 
current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal 
information whenever necessary.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Children and Privacy</span></p>

or legal guardian. If we become aware that a user under the age of 13 
has registered with our Site, provided personal information, and MeetSOCI.com 
has not obtained prior verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian, 
we will immediately remove the user's personal information from our 
files.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#262626">Business Transfers</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#262626">In the event that MeetSOCI.com sells substantially all of its assets, 
or one of MeetSOCI.com's business units is acquired, personal information 
of visitors to the Site and aggregate information will likely be one
