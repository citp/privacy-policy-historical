<h1>Meetup Privacy Policy Statement</h1>

<p>Protecting your privacy is a serious matter and doing so is very 
important to us. Please read this privacy policy statement (the "Policy") to learn more about our privacy policy. This Policy describes the information we collect from you and what may happen to that information, and only applies to such information. This Policy applies to all sites under the meetup.com domain.</p>


<h2>Information Collection</h2>


<p>We collect the following information about you and your use of our Website, platform and service (together, our "Platform") in order to create a better, more personalized experience for you:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li> for each topic group in which you participate, a nickname selected
  by you or assigned by us, your email address, your name (if provided) a password selected
  by you, your zip code; and</li>
<li> for each topic group in which you participate, you may choose to
  create and store a short description or statement which will be
  viewed by anyone who is accessing that topic group, and your message board postings.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, we automatically track certain basic information about our users (such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, click patterns, etc.). We use this information to do internal research on our users' usage patterns, demographics, interests and general behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. We do not directly link these types of information with your personally identifiable information. For purposes of this Policy, "personally identifiable information" means any information that could be used to identify your personally (e.g., your email address) or to identify the computer with which you access our Platform.</p>

<p>For our users convenience, we use "cookies" to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session and to provide for an easier registration process. A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on your computer that is tied to information about you. We do not use cookies for any other purpose (for example, we do not use cookies to monitor your activities or otherwise track information about you). If you configure your browser or otherwise choose to reject the cookies, you may still use our site. However, to best experience our website and platform and most easily use our Platform you must have cookies enabled.</p>

<p>Also, if you post messages in message areas (including the personal introduction section of each topic group) on our website, send us personal correspondence, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our website, we may collect such information and include it in your profile. Your profile is not accessible to other users or third parties other than Meetup personnel.</p>

<p>We use the information we collect about you (including your personally identifiable information) to create a better, more personalized experience for you based on your individual usage habits, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our site's content, layout and Services.

<p>We may use for promotional, sales or any use that we consider appropriate your correspondence with us or photographs submitted for publication on our website, be it via email, postings on our website, or feedback via the user polls. We will not link any of this correspondence or photographs to your personally identifiable information.</p>
