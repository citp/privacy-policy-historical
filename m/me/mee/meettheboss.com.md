# Executive Leadership & Management Training - MeetTheBoss TV

[www.meettheboss.tv](http://www.meettheboss.tv/) (‘the website’) is strongly committed to protecting your privacy while interacting with our content, products and services in a safe and secure environment.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what kind of information we may gather about you when you visit our site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct this information. Our policy allows you to choose what kind of and how much information you provide to us and to control how we use whatever information you give us. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing you to control your privacy and giving you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have.

This policy applies only [www.meettheboss.tv](http://www.meettheboss.tv/) and not to any external websites to which it is linked.

  


### Collection of information

Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked to provide information such as your name, email address or information about what you like and do not like. It is entirely your choice whether to respond to these questions or not.

[www.meettheboss.tv](http://www.meettheboss.tv/) collects two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For instance, we may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth - they are 'anonymous' to us. Another example of the website collecting anonymous information is when users are invited to respond to surveys on www.meettheboss.tv. The surveys may ask you for demographic information such as your age, gender and postcode. This information is collected for research purposes, is used in the aggregate (where possible) and remains anonymous. Many of the individuls who access our services are anonymous to us.

The second type of information that [www.meettheboss.tv](http://www.meettheboss.tv/) collects is personal information. The website will collect personal information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address or postal address, when you provide it to us. With this information, www.meettheboss.tv can provide a variety of personalised and enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users. We hope that you will find it beneficial to provide individually identifiable information about yourself to us because it will make our services more valuable to you.

Sometimes, we may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a service. Certain information may be required, such as your name, age, internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number, in order to provide that service or product to you. This information may also be used to inform you of additional products and services that may interest you. You can choose not to receive such information when you are undertaking product or service registration on our website. We may also ask about your interests, but it is your choice whether you respond.

How much of your personal information that you choose to disclose to [www.meettheboss.tv](http://www.meettheboss.tv/) is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us, for example when you take part in a discussion forum or enter one of the competitions on our websites.

  


### Use of anonymous information

[www.meettheboss.tv](http://www.meettheboss.tv/) automatically gathers anonymous information to monitor site use: like the numbers and frequency of visitors to the website and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program.

This collective data helps us determine how much our audiences use parts of the site, so we can improve www.meettheboss.tv to assure that they are as appealing as we can make them for as many users as possible. [www.meettheboss.tv](http://www.meettheboss.tv/) may publish or provide this aggregate data to other people.
