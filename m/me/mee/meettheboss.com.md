#### Collection of information

Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.

It is entirely your choice whether to respond to these questions or not.

GDS Publishing Ltd websites collects two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For instance, we may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth - they are 'anonymous' to us. Another example of GDS Publishing Ltd websites collecting anonymous information is when the GDS Publishing Ltd are invited to respond to surveys on GDS Publishing Ltd websites. The surveys may ask you for demographic information such as your age, gender and postcode. This information is collected for research purposes, is used in the aggregate (where possible) and remains anonymous. Many of the individuals who access our services are anonymous to us.

The second type of information that GDS Publishing Ltd websites collect is personal information. GDS Publishing Ltd websites will collect personal information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address or postal address, when you provide it to us. With this information, GDS Publishing Ltd websites can provide a variety of personalised and enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users.

Sometimes, we may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a service. Certain information may be required, such as your name, age, internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number, in order to provide that service or product to you. This information may also be used to inform you of additional products and services that may interest you. You can choose not to receive such information when you are undertaking product or service registration on our website. We may also ask about your interests, but it is your choice whether you respond.

How much of your personal information that you choose to disclose to the GDS Publishing Ltd is completely up to you.
