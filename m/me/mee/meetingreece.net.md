## 1\. Introduction.

1.1. General.

The following presents important information relating to Beronata Services's Privacy Policy. Because protecting your privacy is very important to Beronata Services, we have established a privacy policy that safeguards your personal information, and are committed to protecting its confidentiality. We will limit the collection and use of personally identifiable information ("Individual Information"), to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the quality Services, and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest. We will NOT disclose any Individual Information unless (i) we believe that such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (including without limitation search warrants, court orders, or providing assistance to law-enforcement authorities investigating the alleged commission of a crime), (2) with respect to payment processing and billing (e.g., to a credit-card bank may help us prove the legitimacy of a credit-card charge or bill), (3) if the disclosure of Individual Information is necessary to provide services that third parties provide to you on Beronata Services's behalf, or (4) as otherwise set forth herein (i.e., in Section 5 hereunder).

1.2. Types of Individual Information.

Individual Information is any information, data or records that relate to your Beronata Services membership or use of Beronata Services and identifies you or your individual Member account. The three types of Individual Information are; (1) "identity and billing information," including without limitation your name, street address, telephone number, billing information, and any account information associated with your screen names; (2) "navigational and transactional information," including without limitation information about which pages or products or services you access through Beronata Services; and (3) "private communications," including without limitation the contents of e-mail, or private chat room communications.

## 2\. Member Identity and Billing Information.

We maintain various types of identity and billing information ("Billing Information"), including without limitation, your name, street address, telephone number(s), length of membership, and payment information. We may also keep information on your communications with our customer service department, employees or contractors, and general account history, such as accumulated usage credits or written complaints relating to your account. We safeguard Billing Information from unauthorized access and only authorized employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted access to Individual Information. Beronata Services employees who violate Beronata Services's privacy policies are subject to disciplinary actions, including possible termination. We may use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage, processing, and other limited functions on Beronata Services's behalf.

We use Billing Information to administer our business, ensure that you are properly billed and to communicate with you if the need arises.

Beronata Services, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in extraordinary circumstances (including without limitation a bomb or suicide threat, or instances of suspected illegal activity) on a case-by-case basis. When feasible, we do allow our Members to access and verify their Billing Information. We also allow our Members to request corrections to this information.

2.4. Compelling Obligation.

Although Beronata Services will take reasonable measures not to disclose Billing Information, we may be compelled to do so in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary (a) to comply with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to enforce Beronata Services's terms and conditions; (d) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (e) to protect the interests of Beronata Services or others.
