<h3 class="outerH">Privacy Policy<br>

<span class="tagfont">Last updated: 04-04-2011</span></h3> <div class="clear">This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the MealDeal website  (collectively, the "Website" located at <a href="http://www.mealdeal.com">www.mealdeal.com</a>). MealDeal, LLC, a Florida company, the provider  of the Website (referred to as "Company" or "us" or "we"), is committed to  protecting your privacy online. Please read the following to learn what  information we collect from you (the "User" or the "End User") and how we use  that information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please  email us.<br>
  <br>
  <p class="bold">PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING  OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE  TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF  USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR  USE THE WEBSITE.</p><br>

<h4>1. Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post  those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we  deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we  use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.<br>
    We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at  any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this  policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of notice on our home  page.<br><br>
  <h4>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected  Information</h4>
    We collect two types of information about our Website  Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable  Information.<br>
    <br>
  <span class="bold ">Personally Identifiable Information</span>.  Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific  End User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as  creating an account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners,  submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a  contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey,  posting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information  about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job,  posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the  Website (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide  certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an  Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity,  however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about  yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip  code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order  products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card  number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information.  Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is  identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not  provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you  will not be permitted to engage in that activity.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">Rewards Policy</span>. If you choose to use our  referral service or buy a deal for a friend, we will ask you for your friend's  name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email  with the gift you bought for them or inviting him or her to visit the site. We  store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email,  sending their gift, and tracking the success of our referral program.<br>
  <br>
    Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mealdeal.com">support@mealdeal.com</a> to  request that we remove this information from our database.<br>
    <br>
    We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide  products and services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the  operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts,  analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor  your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy  Policy. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use your  comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your  comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. Your comments may contain  personal information such as your name, we will obtain consent from you to post  your name along with your comment prior to posting your comment for public  view. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product to  another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use  Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes,  accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you,  including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with  applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.<br>
    <br>
  <span class="bold ">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</span>.  Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a  specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform  Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Website,  the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser  you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our  authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically  collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of  electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in  Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
    We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to  troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic  information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement  activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party  Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our  online advertising, content, and programming.<br>
    <br>
  <h4>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
    We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally  Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:<br>
    <br>
  <span class="bold ">We may share your information with your contacts</span>. We may use and display your full  name and email address when you choose to send an email notification to a contact  (such as in an invitation, recommendation, or referral).<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">We may share your information with Company Merchants</span>. From  time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as "Company  Merchants") who, as part of the offer, request information on Company customers  who purchased the offer in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we share  some of your Personally Identifiable Information with Company Merchants.  Sharing this Information may allow a Company Merchant to market directly to you  should they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally  Identifiable Information with a Company Merchant if you engage in an  Identification Activity, and then only to the Company Merchant involved in that  Identification Activity. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or  liability for the actions of such Company Merchant. While we inform them that  they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the  specific promotion with Company, we do not have any responsibility for the  actions of the Company Merchant, and the actions of the Company Merchant are  not in our control.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">We may share your information with Authorized Third  Party Service Providers</span>. We provide services and products through third  parties. These "Third Party Service Providers" perform functions on our behalf,  like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We  may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers  to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, administer contests  or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data,  provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit  card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service.  We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies  ("Affiliates") with whom we have business relationships and may share your  information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For  example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information to  the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable,  release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise,  we may release an Affiliate's information to our bank to send out a payment. We  encourage Company Merchants and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post  privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information  by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not  subject to our control.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">We may remarket your information</span>.  Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users, based upon your past  interactions with the Company website. Third-party marketing vendors may be  hired by Company to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party  vendors, including Google, may show Company ads on sites on the internet.  Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a  user's prior visits to Company's website. Users may opt out of Google's use of  cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at  http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. This information is used only for  remarketing purposes and will not be used by them for any other purpose.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">We may share your information in a Business Transfer</span>. As  with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another  company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we  maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally  Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">We may share your information for our Protection and the  Protection of Others</span>. We reserve the right to disclose your personally  identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure  is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding,  court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this  Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the  rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.<br>
  <br>
  <h4>4. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
    We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable  Information with Partners, Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may  share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally  Identifiable Information) with "Third Party Advertisers" or "Third Party  Advertising Companies" and other parties as provided below:<br>
    <br>
    We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads  when you visit our Website. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable  Information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide,  through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that  may be of interest to you. Some of these Third Party Advertising Companies may  be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative  ("NAI"). If you would like more information about any NAI member company, or  you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising from any NAI member company,  click here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a><br>
    <br>
    We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and  analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information  from our Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality. We  may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a  representative audience for Advertisers. Please note that this is not  Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities  of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by  us.<br>
    <br>
  <h4>5. Updating and Correcting Information</h4>
    We believe that you should have the ability to access  and edit the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us. You may change  any of your Personally Identifiable Information by logging into your account  and accessing the "my account" section of the site, sending us an  email at <a href="mailto:support@mealdeal.com">support@mealdeal.com</a>. Please indicate your name, address and email  address, and what information you would like to update when you contact us.<br>
    <br>
    We encourage you to promptly update your Personally  Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on  your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past  transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions  on the Website. In addition, in may be impossible for us to completely delete  all of your information because we periodically backup information.<br>
    <br>
    If you choose to store credit card information on the  site, this is stored on a secure page and you may delete your credit card  information at any time by going to the "my account" section of your  profile.<br>
    <br>
  <h4>6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h4>
    As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide  information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the  Website.<br>
    <br>
    As a condition of purchase of our products and services,  we will send you Administrative and Promotional emails. We will send you  information regarding your account activity and purchases as well as updates  about our products and promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative  Emails. "Administrative Emails" relate to a User's activity on the Website, and  include emails regarding a particular User's account, requests or inquiries,  and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative Emails,  however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional  Emails advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other  offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If  you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out  of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us  at <a href="mailto:support@mealdeal.com">support@mealdeal.com</a>, by writing to us at the address contained herein, or  by hitting the "unsubscribe" button at the bottom of any of our e-mails. When  contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what  Promotional Emails you do not want to receive.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  <h4>7. Security of Information</h4>
    We take security seriously and take numerous precautions  to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. You can access  your Personally Identifiable Information on our Website through a password and  your email address. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not  share your password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable  Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and  contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information (such as  credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure  that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to  us.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or  any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we  employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to  partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of  any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for  the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.<br>
    <br>
  <h4>8. Data Tracking</h4>
  <span class="bold ">Cookies</span>. To facilitate and customize your  experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a  small text file that is stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes  which contains information about that User. We use cookies to save you time  while using the Website, remind us who you are, and track and target User  interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to  collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you  visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to  create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may  use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website.  As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We  have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the  use of cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any  Advertiser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to  modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you  decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work  properly.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">Other Tracking Devices</span>. We may use other industry  standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our  Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers  to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic  images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us  to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access  these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally  Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve  our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as  give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize  pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners  for the same purposes.<br>
  <br>
  <h4>9. Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</h4>
    This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and  disclosure of information we collect from you on www.groupon.com. Other websites  that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy policies and  data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link to any such website,  we urge you review the website's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the  policies or practices of third parties.<br>
    <br>
  <h4>10. Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</h4>
    If you have questions or complaints regarding our  privacy policy or practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mealdeal.com">support@mealdeal.com</a>.<br>
    <br>
  <span class="bold ">Children</span>. Minors under the age of 18 may  not use the Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from  anyone under the age of 18, and no part of the Website is designed to attract  anyone under the age of 18. Company does not sell products for purchase by  children<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">Public Areas</span>. We may provide areas on our  Website where you can publicly post information about yourself, can communicate  with others such as discussion boards or blogs, or can review products,  restaurants, and submit media content. This information may be accessible by  other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches,  and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by others.  For example, if you post your email address along with a public restaurant  review, you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads  your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily  post, so please use caution when posting any personal information. We do obtain  consent from our users to post their name along with their reviews.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold ">Facebook Connect</span>. The Company Site allows  users to access Facebook Connect to interact with friends and to share on  Facebook through Wall and friends' News Feeds. If you are logged into Company  and Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" your profiles  will merge if the email addresses match. If the email addresses don't match, we  ask you if you want to merge them and you must enter your Company password to  validate that they control that account. If you are already logged into Company  but not logged into Facebook, when you click on "Connect with  Facebook" you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to  "Sign up for Facebook." By proceeding you are allowing the Company  Site to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of  Use in your use of Company Sites.<br>
  <br>
    Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a Company  user and you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be  asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to  register and join Company. Once you register on the Company site and Connect  with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to  Facebook. You have the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by  logging into "My Profile" and clicking on "My Facebook  Profile." Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that  appear on Facebook or disconnect this service by visiting the Facebook  Application Settings page.<br><br>
  <h4>11. Contacting Us</h4>
  
    Whether you're a new or loyal customer, restaurant  owner, marketer, publisher, media member or job seeker we'd like to stay  connected and want to hear from you!<br>
