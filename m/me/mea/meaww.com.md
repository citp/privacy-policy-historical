Meaww Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May, 2018

This Policy explains how we protect and handle any information you provide to us, including via our websites, mobile apps, communications by email and through social media, by telephone and in person. It also covers information we receive from third parties. It also provides you with an overview of the rights you can exercise regarding what we do with your information.

By using our products and services, including browsing our websites, registering or logging in, we may use your information as outlined in this Policy.

Eleven Internet Services LLP (doing business as Meaww), ( “Meaww” ,  “we” , or  “us” ) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the  “Websites” ), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices  (“Apps” ), and through our social media pages and apps  (“Social Media Pages” ) as well as any email messages we send that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the Websites, Apps, our Social Media Pages and email messages are hereinafter referred to as the  “Services” ) . Your use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.  

  1. 


We collect and receive information about users in a few different ways:

##  A.        Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  When you use any of the Services, we may collect certain data that does not tell us specifically who you are. This is  “Non-Personally Identifiable Information.”  Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes things such as  but not limited to your browser type and device information, App usage data, information that has been aggregated in a manner that it no longer reveals your specific identity, demographic information, IP addresses, and other information you provide that does not reveal your specific identity, and the last domain you visited before coming to our Service or the domain you go to when you leave. It also includes various statistical data such as which pages you visit by using our Services, how long you stay on them, and what you click.  

What is a cookie and how we use it?

We may place a “cookie” on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We may use cookies to, among other things, keep track of your choice of language and home page preference, to  select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are using the Services, for purposes of tracking responses to our online advertisements, , for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, and to gather usage data that will help us generally improve the quality of the Services. There is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept cookies. You should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features of the Services. 

We may use Flash Local Shared Objects ( “Flash LSOs” ) and other similar technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.  If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage by visiting:  ( <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html> )

Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications. 

When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi signals.  We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.  We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.

NOTE:  Where you use our services, cookies and similar technologies are used for analytics. Such analytics do not personally identify you. It is not presently possible to opt-out of these cookies and similar technologies. If you do not want to be included in our analysis, please do not use our apps.
