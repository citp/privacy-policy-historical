### Overview

### Information we collect about you

We may collect personal information that can identify you, such as your name and email address and other information that you provide to us. We may also collect information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.

  * **Information you provide.** We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, email address, image, telephone number, ZIP code, gender, age and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). 
  * **Information from other sources.** We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information (updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information) about you from business partners, contractors, and other third parties and add it to your account information or other information we have collected. 



### Your choices about collection and use of your information

  


#### New Users

  * You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member.



#### Registered Users

  * While Meal Train does not give you the opportunity to remove your information from our database, you may remove your registration information from your My Profile page.
  * Account Changes 
    * **Profile Changes** (except for account closure) may be done at any time through mealTrain.com. Click on the "My Profile" link, and change the desired information.
    * **Account Closure:** If you have an online profile with us, you may choose to close your account at any time by submitting a request via the "Contact Us" link on the home page of the Meal Train website. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website, access any of your personal information, and all future events that you have created or scheduled will be cancelled. You can open a new account at any time. 
      * If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and record keeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our Terms of Service, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.
