<h1>MEC's Website Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This statement discloses the privacy practices and policies for 
Mountain Equipment Co-operative's (MEC's) website. If you have any questions about these practices and policies, please email us at <b>privacy@mec.ca</b>.</p>
<p>MEC respects your personal privacy. We believe ensuring the security of your personal information is an important part of our job. If we ask you to provide any personal information, we will tell you the purposes for which we intend to use that information. Your personal information is not lent or sold to anyone for any purpose.</p>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p>To learn more about MEC's policies, please view the following pages:</p>
<p class="archevron"><a href="/AST/ContentPrimary/Utilities/Help/PrivacyPolicy/TermOfUse.jsp">Read the Website Terms of Use</a></p>
<p class="pdflink"><a href="http://images.mec.ca/media/Images/pdf/MEC_privacy_code_v1_m56577569830533314.pdf" target="_blank">Download the MEC Privacy Code PDF</a>&nbsp;(31KB)</p>
<h2>Information Collection, Use, and Disclosure</h2>
<p>Information gathered on mec.ca falls under the following categories:</p>
 <ul>
  <li><a href="#aggregate">Aggregate Site Use Information</a></li>
  <li><a href="#order">Online Order Information and Security</a></li>
  <li><a href="#membership">MEC Membership Information</a></li>
  <li><a href="#subscription">Subscriptions, Online Gear Swap, and Events List Information</a></li>
 </ul>
<a name="aggregate"></a>
<h2>Aggregate Site Use Information</h2>
<p>We record information about the pages viewed by all of our website visitors. This data includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, connection speed, read time, display time, and number of clicks.</p>
<p>We use this data, in aggregate form, to compile statistics and reports for Mountain Equipment Co-operative's use, and improve the online experience for all visitors.</p>
<p>We may, on occasion, provide portions of this aggregate information to vendors, consultants, potential advertisers, or news agencies. Typical uses of the data in this fashion would be to gauge the amount of interest in our site and/or to plan for site infrastructure improvements.</p>
<a name="cookie"></a>
<h3>Cookie Use</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file stored on a user's hard drive. Depending on how you have configured your browser, when you visit our site we use cookies. <b>Cookies are required to shop on our site</b>. We use cookies to assist with anonymous site traffic analysis, which includes tracking the time/date of visits, pages viewed, and referring URLs.</p>
<p>There are simple ways to either refuse all cookies, or accept them each time they are offered. Consult your browser's help files for assistance on changing cookie settings or removing cookie files.</p>
<a name="order"></a>
<h2>Online Order Information and Security</h2>
<p>If you place an order online, we only request the information needed to complete the processing of your orders and billing. We also share our users' personal information with outside shipping companies and credit card processing companies in order to bill and ship your order, but we do not provide any more information than necessary for these purposes. We may also use the information to contact you regarding your order.</p>
<a name="security"></a>
<h3>Our Site Security</h3>
<p>We use appropriate security safeguards to protect your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access. Any personal information you provide to Mountain Equipment Co-operative is exchanged on a secure server. We use one of today's most advanced security systems, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, to encrypt, or encode, information you send to us in the order process. The encryption process protects information, such as your credit card number, and billing and shipping information by scrambling it before it is sent from your computer. Only once we receive your information is it decoded, and we make all reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our own systems.</p>
<h3>Warning:</h3>
<p>e-mail is not a secure means to send personal information, as it is not encrypted. We strongly encourage you to use our secure ordering process when ordering online. For general correspondence we also have our secure Contact Us page at <a href="/Apps/contactUs/contactUs.jsp">info@mec.ca</a>.</p>
<a name="membership"></a>
<h2>MEC Membership Information</h2>
<p>As a co-operative, MEC requires your assistance in providing us with your personal information to fulfil our regulatory obligations. If you become a member, you must provide certain information which is added to our internal membership database, which co-operatives must maintain by law. The information maintained in the database includes:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>member number;</li>
  <li>the name, address, and telephone number of the member;</li>
  <li>the number of patronage bonus shares held by the member;</li>
  <li>the date on which the name of the member was entered in the register as a member with the co-operative;</li>
  <li>the date on which any person ceased to be a member of the co-operative.</li>
 </ul>
<p>The information contained in the database can only be used for corporate purposes pertaining to Mountain Equipment Co-operative, such as catalogue mailings, Board election information and other correspondence. MEC does not sell, rent, or loan our membership lists to anyone.</p>
<h3>Updating Membership Data</h3>
<p>Membership information previously provided to MEC can be up updated online at <a href="/Membership/login.jsp?loginSource=4">www.mec.ca/update</a>, or by calling Membership Services at 1.800.474.7704 (Canada and U.S.) or 604.876.6221 (Local and International).</p>
<h4>Opting Out</h4>

<p>Please note, however, that as a co-operative we are required by law to maintain certain information about our members, as noted above in Information, Collection, Use &amp; Disclosure, which we are required by law to maintain even after a member has terminated his or her membership.</p>

<h2>Fraud Prevention</h2>
<p>Mountain Equipment Co-operative reserves the right to co-operate with local, national, or international law enforcement or other authorities in the investigation of improper or unlawful activities and this may require the disclosure of personal information. If such an investigation requires disclosure of personal information kept in our records, we may be required by law to cooperate.

Nonetheless, if our records regarding your personal information are inaccurate or incomplete, we will amend that information at your request.</p>
<h2>Access to Information</h2>
<p>At your request, we will provide to you a statement explaining the extent to which we hold personal information about you, and we will explain how that information has been used or disclosed by us.</p>
<p>This page will be updated if information about the collection and use of your personal data changes.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>MEC may update this privacy policy in the future. We will notify you about material changes to this privacy policy by placing a prominent notice on our website. As well, a history of those changes will be noted here, beginning with changes published after January 1, 2005.</p>

<p>Any changes in our use of personal information contrary to Members' initial consent will be posted, in advance, on our website with instructions regarding consent to any changes.  Notices may also be posted in our stores and sent by email.  All changes will remain in compliance with federal and provincial privacy legislation.</p>
