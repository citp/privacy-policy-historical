Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the current events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that MechQuest has designed and made available exclusively to our users. In addition, MechQuest may send promotional items and advertisements from the sponsors, however MechQuest will not divulge your personal information to the sponsor directly.

**II. Subscriber Accounts**

In addition to the above, however, we will require you to provide the following information:  
1) First and last name

**What We WILL DO With Your Personal Information**  
MechQuest does not disclose any personal information except to those that help it provide technical, administrative and data processing services(including hosting, billing, affiliate tracking, fulfillment, and data storage and security) “Affiliated Parties”.  The Affiliated Parties to whom MechQuest discloses your personal information all have agreed to abide by this Privacy Policy. Please note that some of these Affiliated Parties have separate privacy policies that govern their collection, use and storage of information that you provide to them directly. Example: Paypal has their own privacy policy for customers using their services.

**What We WILL NOT DO With Your Personal Information**  
MechQuest is supported by its Subscriber Account Users. Therefore MechQuest does not sell or knowingly divulge your information to advertisers or any other non-Affiliated Parties, unless we are required to share your information with a third party in order to comply with law, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our site or game rules; to protect the safety and security of our users and our Web sites.  

**Other Provisions**  
**What Are Cookies?**  
A cookie is a little piece of information handed to a web browser to a web server that contains information that can be retrieved from the server later. MechQuest uses cookies only to the limited extent of recognizing the registered user and pairing that user with the character that the user created and the account preferences set by that user within the game. 

**What are IP Addresses?**  
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique address that certain electronic devices use in order to identify and communicate with each other on a computer network utilizing the Internet Protocol standard (IP)—in simpler terms, a computer address. Any participating network device—including routers, computers, time-servers, printers, Internet fax machines, and some telephones—can have their own unique address.

**Message Boards**  
The MechQuest message board is a place for users of the game to interact by posting messages. The message board must be signed up for separately from the game and is subject to TERMS OF USE. 

**Security and Credit Card Use**  
MechQuest does not process your payments directly. Instead we contract this service to PayPal. Founded in 1998, PayPal, an eBay Company, enables any individual or business with an email address to securely, easily and quickly send and receive payments online. To find our more about PayPal and its privacy and security policies, please click on the following link www.paypal.com.

**CHILDRENS’S PRIVACY POLICY**  
MechQuest encourages parents and legal guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents and legal guardians to instruct their children to never give out their personal information online without permission. We also recognize a special need to protect personal information obtained from children. In compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of 14 (“Children”):

**Type and Use of Information Collected from Children**  
To create a Free Account, MechQuest does not collect or requite for the child to provide any personally identifiable information if the child is known to MechQuest to be under the age of 14.

To create a Subscriber Account, MechQuest does require an e-mail address as well as the parent’s correct billing information as outlined under the Subscriber Accounts section. The setting up of the account by the parents is considered an actual verifiable consent by the parent for the child to use this website as required by COPPA.

For Subscriber Accounts, we use your child’s e-mail address for the following purposes:  
1\. To send a confirmation notice to the child of their character registration and password information.  
2\. Upon the child’s request, to send the user password information when the child has lost or forgotten the password.  
3\. In response to any questions, concerns or problems that the child contacted MechQuest about.*   
4\. To contact the child about any problem with the child’s account or conduct in the game.  
5\. To send out a newsletter**.

*We recognize that young children may inadvertently give out personal information in addition to their e-mail address when contacting us with any questions, problems, or concerns they have encountered while playing the game. We do not collect or use any such additional personal information acquired in this manner unless it is necessary for us to respond to the problem or question or concern. We do not divulge any such information to any third parties unless we are required to do so by law, court order or subpoena.

** MechQuest game is unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the upcoming events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that MechQuest has designed and made available exclusively to our users. MechQuest may also forward promotions and advertisements from our sponsors, however MechQuest will not release any personal information to the sponsors directly.

If a child desires to upgrade his/her account to Subscriber Status, a parent or legal guardian will be required to divulge additional reasonably necessary information as described above under Subscriber Accounts.

MechQuest does not sell or knowingly divulge your child’s information to advertisers or any other third parties, unless we are required to share your child’s information with a third party in order to comply with law, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our site or game rules; to protect the safety and security of our users and our Web sites.

Also, please note that MechQuest does not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the activity.

**Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent**  
At this time, whenever MechQuest is aware that a user is under the age of 14, MechQuest does not require any personal information for that user to set up a free account. For Subscriber Accounts, the receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable consent from the parents to the child’s use of our website and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments, verify and maintain the account.

**How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their children?**  
Parents can find out what personally identifiable information is being kept by MechQuest about their child by e-mailing mq.privacy@battleon.com. Parents can then request to purge either all or specific portions of that information by e-mailing mq.privacy@battleon.com.

**Revision Information**  
MechQuest reserves the right to change, modify, or revise this Privacy Policy in order to comply with any applicable laws or changes within the game or for any other reason at any time. Therefore our users are encouraged to check the Privacy Policy periodically to read about any changes, modifications, or revisions.
