# Privacy Policy

**Melaleuca Privacy Policy effective August 2, 2006. MELALEUCA and its affiliates and subsidiaries ("MELALEUCA") are committed to respecting your privacy. We've structured our Web site so that, in general, you can visit MELALEUCA on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with MELALEUCA.**

This statement regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information you provide online covers five main areas: **Awareness, Choice, Accuracy, Access, Security, and third party links.**

**  
AWARENESS**

MELALEUCA provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every page on our Web site.

We will collect the domain name from which you log on, aggregate information on what pages you access or visit, user-specific information on what pages you access or visit and information volunteered by you (such as survey information and/or site registrations). 

We do not collect your E-mail address unless you contact us by E-mail or volunteer your E-mail address and other personal information.
