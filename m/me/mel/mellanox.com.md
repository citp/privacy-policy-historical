We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of customer information.

Nevertheless, when disclosing any personal information via the Internet, there is always the risk that your information may be intercepted without our consent and, consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent.  In addition, third party sites that are accessed through links on our sites have separate privacy policies and security measures, and Mellanox is not responsible or liable for the practices, policies or security measures implemented on these third party sites.  _You hereby acknowledge that Mellanox is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner_.
