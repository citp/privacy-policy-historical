Mellon does not collect any personal information from anyone who is merely visiting or browsing its Web sites. Personal information may be requested if the visitor chooses to respond to online surveys, send Mellon an e-mail message, use any of the tools or net worth/financial worksheets, or use Mellon's Online Banking product. 

**E-mail and Product Inquiry**  
Mellon invites visitors on its site to send e-mail messages to Mellon so that Mellon may respond to inquiries regarding our products or services. Mellon retains copies of these e-mail messages. The information provided by a visitor will only be used to respond to the visitor's inquiry and to provide better customer service. 

**Transactional Services**  
Within this web site, Mellon offers transactional services. In order to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided through these services, Mellon requires that users have a browser that supports 128-bit "strong" encryption. 

**Use of Cookies**  
A cookie is a small piece of information about an Internet session that may be created when a visitor accesses a Web site. Mellon uses cookies to facilitate easier navigation within the site and to provide a higher level of convenience for the visitor. We do not use cookies for any other purposes. 

**Use of Information Collected**  
Mellon uses the information collected from visitors to its site to address the specific needs of those visitors and to provide better customer service, including the provision of the latest information regarding Mellon’s products. The information collected also is used to provide a record of communications between Mellon and visitors to its site and to comply with any applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements. 

**ACCESS TO INFORMATION COLLECTED**

**Employees.** Certain Mellon employees will be provided with a visitor's information in order to respond to that visitor's needs and provide the visitor with information regarding specific products in which the visitor may have an interest. Mellon employees are instructed to use strict standards of care in handling the personal, confidential information of Mellon customers, and the handling of such information is dealt with in Mellon’s Code of Conduct. Mellon employees who do not conform to Mellon’s confidentiality rules are subject to disciplinary sanctions that include dismissal. 

**Third Parties.** In limited cases Mellon may share customer names and contact information with a third party offering financial products and services that supplement the products and services provided by Mellon, (assuming the customer has not exercised a right to opt out of such sharing). Except in these limited cases, Mellon does not transmit any personal information collected through this site to third parties for marketing purposes. Personal information may be transmitted, however, if there is a specific need to complete a transaction requested by the visitor.
