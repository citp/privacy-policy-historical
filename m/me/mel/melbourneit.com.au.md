**Why and when Melbourne IT collects your information**  
Back to Top

  * **Personal information you give us**

Melbourne IT collects the information you give us either online or by email, post, facsimile, face to face, over the phone or through our reseller channel, including wholesalers and partners. In most cases, the personal information Melbourne IT will collect from you is the personal information we are required to obtain and pass on to the relevant registry when you apply to register a domain name with or transfer a domain name to Melbourne IT. This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address and where applicable, your facsimile number. Melbourne IT also collects your payment details from you when you apply to register a domain name, such as your credit card number or bank account details. 

If you purchase a digital certificate through us, we are required by the provider of those certificates to collect personal information from you to pass back to that provider. We will also collect your payment details from you such as your credit card number or bank account details. 

  * **Website information (including cookies)**

Melbourne IT makes limited use of cookies on this website. A cookie is a small message given to your web browser by our web server. The browser stores the message, and sends the message back to the server each time you request a page from the server. 

Melbourne IT only uses cookies to tell us when you have set up an account with us previously (i.e. when you are a "registered user" of our website), and sometimes to let us know how you found our website. Where the cookies tell us that you are a registered user, cookies also allow us to automatically link you to your personalised accounts so that you can easily access any products or services only made available to our registered users, without your having to provide us with your username and password on every web page. The cookies allow us only to identify you in our database if you are a registered user, and to connect you to the relevant products and services on our website, but not to track the pages you visited on our website. 

You always have the option to disable cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, you should be aware that many of the services available on the Melbourne IT website will not work if you have chosen to do this. 

In addition to cookies, Melbourne IT servers register the type of web browser you are using and your IP address when you access our website.

  * **Use of your information as required by ICANN or other domain administrators, or the registries**

ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is the organisation which governs the functions performed by both its accredited registrars (of which Melbourne IT is one), and the registries in regulating the domain name registration process. ICANN requires that each of its registrars must make available the personal information we collect from you when you apply to register any generic top level domain names (ie., com, net, org, biz, info and name) to the public on a publicly accessible database known as the WHOIS database. In addition, it applies to some of the country code top level domains. For example, in Australia the personal information you supply to us in applying for a domain name registration for a com.au domain name, must be made public on the publicly accessible database run by the com.au registry. 

The public policy behind this requirement is that the personal details of domain name licence holders should be freely available to all other users of the Internet. This public policy is adopted by the domain name industry as a whole. The requirement means, however, that Melbourne IT will not be able to control how members of the public may use the information made available on these publicly accessible databases. 

In addition, ICANN has another mandatory requirement that all its accredited registrars make the WHOIS database of personal information for com, net and org available for bulk downloads by third parties who have entered into a bulk access agreement with Melbourne IT. 

  * **Use of your information to fulfil our role as registrar**

We will be contacting you and may use the personal details you provide to us, at the time you apply for a domain name registration with Melbourne IT or during the licence period of your domain name registration with Melbourne IT, to obtain relevant information from you with respect to your domain name application, or, to advise you of all relevant information relating to your domain name licence. This includes any account administration information including renewal information and billing information, as well as notices of any important system changes which will impact on your online interactions with us. Each of these functions is necessary if Melbourne IT is to effectively fulfil its role as the registrar of your domain names. 

  * **Other uses**
    * Melbourne IT may use your information to measure your experience of our services and products and to inform you of new product developments and associated services that we believe will interest you. If you do not wish to receive email notices or other communications from Melbourne IT regarding additional products and services, please contact us on 1300 654 677 and request to opt-out.
    * We may use your information in statistical form to analyze your purchasing preferences. This information is not used to track your individual preferences but rather to give us a general picture of the products and services our customers prefer. We might also gather information in statistical form such as the number of visitors who visit the Melbourne IT website on a daily basis. Again this is not used to track any individual customer's browsing habits. 
    * We may use your email communications with Melbourne IT to analyze customer service issues as a way of identifying potential improvements for Melbourne IT products and services. In addition, we may occasionally monitor telephone conversations with you in order to facilitate staff training and to maintain our high levels of customer service. We will always inform you prior to any telephone conversation which is monitored in this way to obtain your prior approval. 
    * We may use your IP address to contact your Internet Service Provider to let you know of any problems with payments you have made to us where we believe this is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud and credit card misuse. 
    * Where you purchase a digital certificate through us, we are required by the provider of those certificates to collect personal information from you to pass back to that provider (other than your payment details, which we hold internally). If you would like to see how your digital certificates provider will treat your personal information, you can find their privacy policy here: <http://www.esign.com.au/repository/privacy/>.

Back to Top

You may access and update the personal information we provide to the registries in respect of your domain name licence at any time. The procedure to do this is explained on the Help Centre on our website at [http://www.melbourneit.com.au/help ](https://web.archive.org/help)

If you believe that Melbourne IT may hold other personal information about you which is inaccurate, please contact us by using this [web form](https://web.archive.org/contacts/support.php?action=fillinmail&subject=Privacy) and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is corrected. 

**Security**  
Back to Top

The transfer of information across any media may involve a certain degree of risk, and the Internet is no different. However, helping you to keep your information secure is very important to Melbourne IT. 

In order to protect the security of personal information transmitted to Melbourne IT online, our Web servers support the use of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol where appropriate. Using this protocol, information transferred between our systems is encrypted. 

In addition, in respect of any payment details you send to us, we reveal only the first six and last three digits of your credit card number on the tax invoice receipt which we send to you for billing purposes. This is to help keep your credit card details secure. 

You can also use simple precautions to help protect your security, such as protecting against the unauthorised use of your username or password or other authentication id.

Melbourne IT may make changes to its privacy policy from time to time. You should check our privacy policy from time to time to see if we have made any changes to it.
