Melbourne IT Ltd (ABN 21 073 716 793)("Melbourne IT") respects your privacy and is committed to the protection of it. 

</p><p>

This privacy policy explains why and when we collect your personal information, and what use we make of that information. 

The policy also explains where and why your information may be disclosed to third parties, and the security measures used 

by Melbourne IT to help protect your personal information.

<a name="why"></a><b class="txtmedium">Why and when Melbourne IT collects your information</b><br> 

<a href="#pagebegin" class="txtsmall">Back to Top</a>

</p><ul>

  <li><strong>Personal information you give us </strong>

      <p>

      Melbourne IT collects the information you give us either online or by email, post, facsimile, face to face, over the phone 

      or through our reseller channel, including wholesalers and partners. In most cases, 

      the personal information Melbourne IT will collect from you is the personal information we are required to 

      obtain and pass on to the relevant registry when you apply to register a domain name with or transfer a domain 

      name to Melbourne IT. This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address and 

      where applicable, your facsimile number. Melbourne IT also collects your payment details from you when you apply 

      to register a domain name, such as your credit card number or bank account details. 

      </p><p>

      If you purchase a digital certificate through us, we are required by the provider of those certificates to collect 

      personal information from you to pass back to that provider. We will also collect your payment details from you such 

      as your credit card number or bank account details. 

      </p><p>

  </p></li>

  <li><strong>Website information (including cookies) </strong>

      <p>

      Melbourne IT makes limited use of cookies on this website. A cookie is a small message given to your web browser by 

      our web server. The browser stores the message, and sends the message back to the server each time you request a 

      page from the server. 

      </p><p>

      Melbourne IT only uses cookies to tell us when you have set up an account with us previously (i.e. when you are 

      a "registered user" of our website), and sometimes to let us know how you found our website. Where the cookies 

      tell us that you are a registered user, cookies also allow us to automatically link you to your personalised accounts 

      so that you can easily access any products or services only made available to our registered users, without your having 

      to provide us with your username and password on every web page. The cookies allow us only to identify you in our 

      database if you are a registered user, and to connect you to the relevant products and services on our website, but not 

      to track the pages you visited on our website. 

      </p><p>

      You always have the option to disable cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, you should be aware that 

      many of the services available on the Melbourne IT website will not work if you have chosen to do this. 

      </p><p>

      In addition to cookies, Melbourne IT servers register the type of web browser you are using and your IP address when 

      you access our website. 

  </p></li>

</ul>



<a name="how"></a><b class="txtmedium">How Melbourne IT uses your information</b><br>

<a href="#pagebegin" class="txtsmall">Back to Top</a>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Use of your information as required by ICANN or other domain administrators, or the registries </strong>

      <p>

      ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is the organisation which governs the functions 

      performed by both its accredited registrars (of which Melbourne IT is one), and the registries in regulating the 

      domain name registration process. ICANN requires that each of its registrars must make available the personal 

      information we collect from you when you apply to register any generic top level domain names (ie., com, net, org, 

      biz, info and name) to the public on a publicly accessible database known as the WHOIS database. In addition, it 

      applies to some of the country code top level domains. For example, in Australia the personal information you supply 

      to us in applying for a domain name registration for a com.au domain name, must be made public on the publicly 

      accessible database run by the com.au registry. 

      </p><p>

      The public policy behind this requirement is that the personal details of domain name licence holders should be 

      freely available to all other users of the Internet. This public policy is adopted by the domain name industry as 

      a whole. The requirement means, however, that Melbourne IT will not be able to control how members of the public 

      may use the information made available on these publicly accessible databases. 

      </p><p>

      In addition, ICANN has another mandatory requirement that all its accredited registrars make the WHOIS database 

      of personal information for com, net and org available for bulk downloads by third parties who have entered into 

      a bulk access agreement with Melbourne IT. 

      </p><p>

  </p></li>

  <li><strong>Use of your information to fulfil our role as registrar </strong>

      <p>

      We will be contacting you and may use the personal details you provide to us, at the time you apply for 

      a domain name registration with Melbourne IT or during the licence period of your domain name registration 

      with Melbourne IT, to obtain relevant information from you with respect to your domain name application, or, to 

      advise you of all relevant information relating to your domain name licence. This includes any account 

      administration information including renewal information and billing information, as well as notices of any 

      important system changes which will impact on your online interactions with us. Each of these functions is 

      necessary if Melbourne IT is to effectively fulfil its role as the registrar of your domain names. 

      </p><p>

  </p></li>

  <li><strong>Other uses </strong>

      <ul>

        <li>Melbourne IT may use your information to measure your experience of our services and products and to inform you of 

            new product developments and associated services that we believe will interest you. If you do not wish to receive 

            email notices or other communications from Melbourne IT regarding additional products and services, please contact us on 

            1300 654 677 and request to opt-out.<p> 

        </p></li>

        <li>We may use your information in statistical form to analyze your purchasing preferences. This information 

            is not used to track your individual preferences but rather to give us a general picture of the products 

            and services our customers prefer. We might also gather information in statistical form such as the number 

            of visitors who visit the Melbourne IT website on a daily basis. Again this is not used to track any individual 

            customer's browsing habits. <p>

        </p></li>

        <li>We may use your email communications with Melbourne IT to analyze customer service issues as a way of 

            identifying potential improvements for Melbourne IT products and services. In addition, we may occasionally 

            monitor telephone conversations with you in order to facilitate staff training and to maintain our high levels 

            of customer service. We will always inform you prior to any telephone conversation which is monitored in this 

            way to obtain your prior approval. <p>

        </p></li>

        <li>We may use your IP address to contact your Internet Service Provider to let you know of any problems with 

            payments you have made to us where we believe this is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud and 

            credit card misuse. <p>

        </p></li>

        <li>Where you purchase a digital certificate through us, we are required by the provider of those certificates to 

            collect personal information from you to pass back to that provider (other than your payment details, which we 

            hold internally). If you would like to see how your digital certificates provider will treat your personal 

            information, you can find their privacy policy here: 

            <a href="http://www.esign.com.au/repository/privacy/">http://www.esign.com.au/repository/privacy/</a>. <p>

        </p></li>

      </ul>  

  </li>

</ul>



<a name="disclosure"></a><b class="txtmedium">Disclosure of your information to third parties</b><br>

<a href="#pagebegin" class="txtsmall">Back to Top</a>

<ul>

  <li><strong>International subsidiary companies </strong>

      <p>

      Melbourne IT is based in Melbourne, Australia.  

      </p><p>

      Melbourne IT also has international subsidiary company offices operating in:

      </p><p>

      </p><ul>

        <li>Wellington, New Zealand;</li>

        <li>San Francisco, USA;</li>

        <li>Madrid, Spain; </li>

        <li>Stockholm, Sweden;</li>

        <li>London, United Kingdom;</li>

        <li>Paris, France; and</li>

        <li>Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>

      Any information which you supply to Melbourne IT or any of its international subsidiary companies will be 

      shared within the internal company group to facilitate our provision of products and services to you. 

      Each of our international subsidiary companies is committed to protecting your personal information. 

      </p><p>

  </p></li>

  <li><strong>Third party service providers </strong>

      <p>

      On occasion, we may supply your personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf, such 

      as the following: 

      </p><p>

      </p><ul>

        <li>the distribution of marketing information to you (except where you have chosen to opt out of receiving this 

            information from us); </li>

        <li>the supply of datacentre storage and maintenance services for our IT systems and infrastructure 

            (by Australian or overseas providers); </li>

        <li>the supply of credit related services such as credit worthiness, credit provision and credit rating, or 

            bank related services; or </li>

        <li>the supply of billing and payment services. </li>

      </ul>

      <p>

      Our relationships with such third party service providers are governed by our contracts with them. Those service 

      providers are required to hold your personal information strictly confidential. 

      </p><p>

  </p></li>

</ul>



<a name="accuracy"></a><b class="txtmedium">Accuracy</b><br>

<a href="#pagebegin" class="txtsmall">Back to Top</a>

<p>

You may access and update the personal information we provide to the registries in respect of your domain name licence at 

any time. The procedure to do this is explained on the Help Centre on our website at 

<a href="/help">http://www.melbourneit.com.au/help </a>

</p><p>

If you believe that Melbourne IT may hold other personal information about you which is inaccurate, please contact us 

by using this <a href="/contacts/support.php?action=fillinmail&amp;subject=Privacy">web form</a> and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is corrected. 

</p><p>



<a name="security"></a><b class="txtmedium">Security</b><br>

<a href="#pagebegin" class="txtsmall">Back to Top</a>

</p><p>

The transfer of information across any media may involve a certain degree of risk, and the Internet is no different. 

However, helping you to keep your information secure is very important to Melbourne IT. 

</p><p>

In order to protect the security of personal information transmitted to Melbourne IT online, our Web servers support 

the use of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol where appropriate. Using this protocol, information transferred 

between our systems is encrypted. 

</p><p>

In addition, in respect of any payment details you send to us, we reveal only the first six and last three digits of 

your credit card number on the tax invoice receipt which we send to you for billing purposes. This is to help keep 

your credit card details secure. 

</p><p>

You can also use simple precautions to help protect your security, such as protecting against the unauthorised use of 

your username or password or other authentication id. 

</p><p>



<a name="changes"></a><b class="txtmedium">Changes</b><br>

<a href="#pagebegin" class="txtsmall">Back to Top</a>

</p><p>

Melbourne IT may make changes to its privacy policy from time to time. You should check our privacy policy from time to 

time to see if we have made any changes to it.
