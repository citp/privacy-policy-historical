	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

	<div class="privacy-wrapper">
		<p><b>Effective
		Date:  October 13, 2014</b></p>

		<p>The purpose of this policy is to inform users about
		the types of user information we receive or collect in order to
		deliver more relevant advertisement to them and how to use their
		devices to control it. This Privacy Policy governs the collection,
		use and disclosure of information by ToneFuse (the company that provides Melody Facts) and its affiliated
		companies. This
		Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the <a href="/terms">Terms
		of Service Agreement</a>,
		which governs your use of the ToneFuse Services in
		general.</p>

		<p><u><b>Information
		We Collect</b></u></p>

		<p><b>Internet
		Activity</b>:  When you visit Melody Facts, our advertisers may track your activity on the service by, for example, tracking
		the pages you visit, the types of songs and lyrics you access or
		download, the artists you follow, the songs you like or dislike, how
		much time you spent on a page, which advertisements you clicked, what
		you search for and so on.  This information becomes part of the
		anonymous user profile that they may build and use to make predictions
		about what types of advertisements might be of most interest to you
		and people like you. 
		</p>

		<p><b>Log
		File and Server Information:</b>  Web and application servers create
		log files automatically as part of the way they are configured. 
		Information in a log or server file might include your IP address,
		browser type, Internet service provider, date and time stamps, media
		access control (MAC) address, file requests and other information. 
		This information is helpful to us in building more accurate user
		profiles.</p>

		<p><b>Device
		Information:</b>  When you access a clients' service from a
		computer, mobile phone, tablet, automobile or other electronic
		device, we, with our clients' consent, collect information about
		your device.  This information may include your IP address, browser
		type and other information about the software and hardware you are
		using.  If you access our clients' service from a mobile device, we
		collect and record information as to the device type, operating
		system as well as unique identifiers such as Android ID, VIN and MAC
		address, IDFA, carrier or other information specific to the device. 
		</p>

		<p><b>Location
		Information:</b>  If your device is enabled to provide real-time
		location information, we may also be able to include that information
		in the user profiles we build.  You can always choose to disable this
		feature on your device if you no longer want it to be activated.  If
		your location is disabled, we may estimate or make assumptions about
		your location based upon other information we collect.</p>

		<p><b>Information
		Obtained from Third Parties:</b>   In addition to the information we
		collect from our clients platforms, we also collect information from
		third parties.  This includes marketing companies and information
		service providers that collect and sell information about consumers. 
		It may also include social media websites and applications or
		services that you have registered to use.  If these sites have a
		relationship with any of our clients, they may automatically provide
		information about you in order to provide you with their services. 
		You can use the controls or tools available through these social
		media sites to opt-out of sharing going forward, but it will not
		affect the data previously shared with us. 
		</p>

		<p><u><b>Information
		Collection Technologies Used</b></u></p>

		<p><b>Cookies:</b>
		 Melody Facts and its clients use "cookies" to help manage and report
		your interaction with their services.  A cookie is a file that a
		server writes to your hard drive.  It contains an alphanumeric
		identifier unique to your device.  Our clients use cookies primarily
		to collect information that enables them, for example, to
		authenticate your login credentials and otherwise manage your use of
		their service.  We use information from cookies mainly to create more
		accurate user profiles so that we can deliver more relevant
		advertisements to you and to compile and report more accurate
		aggregate statistical information to our clients.  Melody Facts and its
		clients use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Session
		cookies expire when you close your browser.  Persistent cookies
		remain on your hard drive for longer periods of time.  You can remove
		persistent cookies by following the instructions in your browser. 
		Melody Facts does not control how your browser control settings operate
		to block or delete cookies.</p>

		<p><b>Beacons
		and Tracking Pixels:</b>  Melody Facts and its clients use technology
		known as beacons or tracking pixels.  These are very small images
		that are imbedded in content on a web or application page.  When
		content containing a beacon is accessed, the beacon transmits
		anonymous information to a server.  Melody Facts and its clients use that
		information primarily to manage content and to measure the
		effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  Melody Facts also uses
		information from beacons and tracking pixels to build more accurate
		user profiles. 
		</p>

		<p><b>Advanced
		Algorithms:</b>  Melody Facts also uses advanced, proprietary algorithms
		to statistically infer information about users using data available
		from the operating system and other sources.  This technology helps
		us to build more complete user profiles without placing cookies on
		your devices.  
		</p>

		<p><u><b>How
		We Use The Information We Collect</b></u></p>

		<p>Melody Facts only collects anonymous user data on what pages are accessed (eg. how long users are on the site, what pages they go to, etc.) and uses this information to improve the site.</p>

		<p><u><b>Opting
		Out of Ad Tracking and Customized Advertising</b></u></p>

		<p><b>On
		Your Computer:</b>  You can remove persistent cookies from your
		computer by following the instructions in your browser.  To learn
		more about how the online advertising industry collects and uses
		information about users to deliver customized advertising and to
		control whether you want to receive customized ads from participating
		service providers, you can visit the following websites: 
		<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a>
		and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.
		  
		</p>

		<p><b>On
		Your Mobile and Tablet Devices:</b> If you use an iOS device and you
		do not want to receive customized advertising, you may opt-out by
		accessing the iAd Network Advertising Settings page from the browser
		on your device.  On newer iOS devises, you can also limit ad tracking
		under "Settings" on the home screen. If you use an Android based
		device, you can visit Google's Ad Settings page from a browser on
		your device and make your choices there.  
		</p>

		<p>Melody Facts
		does not control how your browser or mobile operating systems operate
		to allow you to control advertising tracking and customization.  If
		you have any questions about these control mechanisms, contact your
		service provider directly.</p>

		<p><u><b>Your
		California Privacy Rights</b></u></p>

		<p>Section
		1798.83 of California's Civil Code permits users who are California
		residents to request and obtain, free of charge, one time a year a
		list of the third parties to whom we disclosed their personal
		information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding
		calendar year and the categories of personal information disclosed to
		those third parties.  If you are a California resident and you wish
		to make such a request or if you have any questions about Melody Facts's
		information sharing practices, you may contact us by sending us an
		email or writing to us at the address set forth below.</p>

		<p>California
		law also provides individuals under the age of 18 the right to remove
		personally identifiable information they may have posted about
		themselves on the Internet.  While we do not currently operate any
		services that enable such postings, we believe California residents
		should be aware of these rights.
		</p>

		<p><u><b>International
		Users</b></u></p>

		<p>Melody Facts's
		services are controlled from Melody Facts's offices in the United
		States.  If you interact with our clients' platforms from a
		location outside the U.S., please be advised that any information
		that is collected by us as described herein may be processed in or
		transferred to the U.S. and other locations where privacy protections
		may not be as comprehensive as those in the location where you live. 
		We will, however, use your information only as provided in this
		Privacy Policy.  By using the clients' service, you affirmatively
		consent to our use of your information as described in this Policy.</p>

		<p><u><b>Children</b></u></p>

		<p>Melody Facts
		does not knowingly collect personal information about anyone under
		the age of 13.</p>

		<p><u><b>Security</b></u></p>

		<p>We
		use commercially reasonable electronic and physical security measures
		to protect user information against loss, misuse, unauthorized
		disclosure and alteration and we train our employees on the
		importance of protecting user information, particularly when it
		contains personally identifying information.</p>

		<p><u><b>Changes
		to this Policy</b></u></p>

		<p>We
		reserve the right to change or update this policy and will notify
		users of the changes by updating this page, so please check this page
		periodically for updates.  
		</p>

		Us</b></u></p>

		you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy practices,
		you may <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
