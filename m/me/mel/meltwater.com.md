# Meltwater Group Privacy Policy

Meltwater Group is committed to satisfying your research/media needs while protecting your privacy. We want all our clients to use our service safe in the knowledge that we are committed to their privacy and security. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time as privacy laws and industry practices evolve. We will give you notice of such changes by posting the updated policy on our website with a statement that indicates when the policy was last updated. If you do not wish to accept our Privacy Policy, you must not submit any information to us.

You acknowledge that you have full notice of, and knowingly accept, our privacy practices, as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and, to the extent allowed by applicable law, you irrevocably waive any different protections that may be available to you under the laws of your jurisdiction.

##  The information collected

When you visit this site, your IP address is recorded. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to create statistical reports about usage. Your IP address is used to help identify and to gather broader information about site usage that will not be tied to your identity.

This site also uses "cookies", which are certain bits of information that are deposited on the hard drive of your computer when you visit this site and sent back to this site when you visit again. We use cookies to keep track of the number of users accessing our site and the information they access. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to notify you when you have received a cookie, or alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. However, you may not be able to use certain features on our site if you choose not to accept cookies.

We ask for personal information when you purchase our services, whether through our site or by letter or telephone. The types of personal information that we may collect are: name, company name, title, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, fax number and any other information that we may need to process your order or provide the requested services to you.

##  What we do with that information

Meltwater Group maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. We use your personal information to provide requested information and services to you and to help ensure that the information we provide to you is relevant to your specific needs. We will not sell, trade, rent or lease your personal information to others. However, if we sell or otherwise transfer all or a substantial part of our business to which this site relates, your personal information may be considered to be an asset of our business and may be sold or otherwise transferred to a third party as part of the sale or transfer of such business. The acquirer's own privacy policies will govern the use of your personal information from that point forward.

When you purchase a service, your information will be stored on our system to complete the buying process. It may be shared with an outside party in order to verify your credit card information. We may also share your information with other companies who provide services to us, but we will require those companies to treat your personal information in accordance with this policy. We also record information about your questions to us and your purchases so that we and you can keep track of what you've asked about or ordered. Additionally, we may need to contact you about your questions and/or your orders.

We use email addresses to send you the alerts you have requested, to answer the email we receive and to communicate with you about publications and other services which you have told us you would be interested in hearing about.

##  Data Retention

We retain personal information as part of our normal retention of business records. Furthermore, we will retain personal data for any minimum period required by applicable law.

##  Security

Meltwater Group is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

##  Legal Disclaimer

Although we make reasonable efforts to preserve user privacy, we may in certain circumstances need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website. We may also disclose personal information to (a) enforce our contractual rights relating to the services we provide to you, (b) detect, prevent, or otherwise take action with respect to fraud, security or technical issues, or (c) protect against potential harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our employees or our customers.
