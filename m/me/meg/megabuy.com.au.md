Hi just wanted to say, I have no idea why you guys have such bad reviews. I received my products within 3 days and the Macbook Pro was a 2 week wait but I expected that nothing would ship until after the huge sale! Awesome prices on everything. Couldn't have been happier.

Thanks again to everyone I was in contact with along the way!

Hello, Just to let you know that my computer monitor arrived yesterday. I am very pleased with it and I compliment your company's fast delivery time and professional service. I may purchase another monitor in the future for a spare as I desire a monitor with inbult speakers and most of the monitors available these days don't appear to have this feature. As for the BenQ monitor, I would recommend it highly for future purchasers.

Thanks Megabuy - great service!!! Ordered the item on Wednesday, it was here in Darwin on Monday, with a public holiday in between.  
Excellent prompt service, good price and realistic shipping charges (unlike others).

Well done.

I will deal with you again.

Hi,  
I ordered my GS105AU switch from you guys over the phone. I just want to say how good the service was and how nice the customer service Representative was to me, even though i did not have the correct information I had at the time. So yeah, awesome service thank you Jack G!  
Sincerely, a returning Megabuy customer  


  * Peter M - 02 May 13

Hi, 

I just received my order and I am mightily impressed. 

The whole process from the minute I clicked onto your website for the first time yesterday right through to receipt of my item today was brilliant.   
I was especially impressed with your order confirmation process to ensure that my order placed using a gmail email address was in fact placed by me.   
I still cannot believe that I received delivery of my item in about 24hrs, though I dont know if I can hold you to that if I have to place another order :-) I will definitely recommend Megabuy to others and will use your services again in the future should the need arise.

Again thank you so much for a brilliant purchase experience.

Peter

  * Mite .T. - 08 May 13

  * U. Grebe - 22 May 13

Just letting you know was very impressed with service received. Was delivered in under 24 hrs well done. Thanks 

  * A. Karanwal - 31 May 13

Hi, Received it this arvo! Appreciate the super-quick delivery!!   
Shopped with you for the first time, inspite of the negative reviews on OzBargain, but I have no complains. Have passed on the good word and posted a link on my FB page too!  
Thanks,  


  * A.Walsh - 03 Jun 13

A BIG COMPLIMENT!!!

Late last Friday morning I ordered some software from you guys. I am in Canberra. At 11.45 this morning - Monday - it was delivered!  
Let me sum up:

1\. Best price I could find on what I was buying.  
2\. Only marginally less quick than if I had taken the trouble to go to a specialist store to buy it personally, and DEFINITELY faster than if I had bought from the developer on line.  
3\. A bonus of a local delveryman who, from experience, knew the vagaries of accessing where I live and made it simple (OK - you guys couldn't have organised that, but it was a nice and welcome extra)!

Simply put - this is my first Megabuy purchase. It is unlikely to be my last!  
Many thanks.

  * Dave - 29 Aug 13

Just wanted to give you the thumbs up for the product I recently bought. I bought a graphics card and it was delivered under 2 working days later! Pricing was competitive and service great! Will definitely be using MegaBuy again! 

  * Howard - 02 Sep 13

I am very careful buyer, especially when buying items online, I do a lot of research about the background of the sellers, and read reviews to get a good idea about the genuinity of the seller. I have bought many items from sellers, from around the world. So i talk with a conviction. I recently bought an item from "MegaBuy", and I can say for certain that this seller is one of the most genuine online sellers who handles sales in a very professional way.To anyone who is careful and not sure who to trust when buying from online, I can tell you with a conviction, buy from this seller "MegaBuy" , without having any fear of being 'ripped off'. The products are "Genuine", the packaging of the item are excellent, and everything is done in a professional way. "MegaBuy", Good on you , and keep doing the excellent good work. All the best to all at MegaBuy. You are all Awesome. 

  * Peter Wishart - 05 Sep 13

"Wow" Great Service I received my order this morning.  
I will look forward to my next megabuy purchase.
