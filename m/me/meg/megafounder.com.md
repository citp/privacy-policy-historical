No personal information of any kind is gathered unless you are logged in, at which point only the information agreed on in this Privacy Policy is gathered.

While most browsers accept cookies by default, you can turn off the option or block cookies within your browser; however, because our service requires the use of cookies to effectively run, you may experience a limitation in service by disabling cookies. Nevertheless, by blocking or deleting cookies used on our Service, you may not be able to take full advantage of our service.

**What cookies do we use?**

Megafounder uses the following types of cookies:

IP geolocation cookies: Cookies are used to determine the country where a service is requested from. This cookie is completely anonymous, and it’s only used to help adapt the content to your location.

Additionally, some services may connect with social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. When the user logs into the site using the credentials of a social network, it allows that social network to store a persistent cookie that remembers its identity and ensures that he has access to the services until it expires. The user can delete this cookie and revoke access to services through social networks by updating his preferences in that social network.

Analytical Cookies: each time a user visits the site, a tool from an external service provider (Google Analytics) generates an analytical cookie on the user's computer. This cookie is used to anonymously identify the visitor. It serves to:

  * Identify, anonymously, the users that surf the web (it identifies browsers and devices, not people) and therefore the approximate number of visitors and their trend in the time.
  * Identify, anonymously, the most visited content.
  * Know if the user is a new or recurring visitor.



**Voluntary Disclosure.**

Any personal information or content that you post on public areas of the service will be publicly available and Megafounder is not responsible for how the information is used after being posted. As a result, we ask you to be careful with the information you post publicly.

Project Managers may have access to personal details as delivery addresses when necessary to provide the service.

**Other Terms.**

Megafounder does reserve the right to provide your personal information to legal entities should it be requested and required by law, or if necessary to protect our rights.

If you wish to amend or cancel the personal information you’ve provided us, just log into your account and update your profile. Some information may have to remain stored to comply with legal requirements.

We ask participants to be eighteen years or older in order to use any part of Megafounder. As a result, there are no special terms for persons under the age of eighteen.

While we take every precaution to protect your information and privacy, because of the international nature of Megafounder, it is possible the information may be transferred between countries (such as that used for Google Analytics, or if your computer should be in a different country than our server.)
