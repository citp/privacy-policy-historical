<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="date">October 14th, 2011</div>
<p>Welcome to MegaZebra, a personal online service operated by MegaZebra
 GmbH. ("MegaZebra") which consists of, among other things, software 
that you have downloaded or are about to download, any software that you
 have embedded on a web site or are about to embed (“MegaZebra Games”), 
any applications created by MegaZebra and available through social 
networking sites (“SNS Apps”), any software running on MegaZebra's 
servers, (“MegaZebra Software”), content, related documentation, 
information on the MegaZebra domain, and information made available by 
users to each other through the MegaZebra Software (collectively, the 
“Service”). Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this 
Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information 
about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy 
explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your 
personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy 
carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your 
personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy 
may be amended from time to time. We may update the Privacy Policy and 
if we do, we will post a notice that changes have been made on the 
website www.MegaZebra.com. You should visit this page periodically to 
review any changes to the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What We Collect</strong></p>

<p>MegaZebra gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give us:</p>

<p>When you register a profile with MegaZebra, your profile including 
any information (name, address, gender) will be registered with 
MegaZebra.</p>

<p>When you identify yourself on a MegaZebra site, you may identify yourself using a MegaZebra account.</p>

<p>When you identify yourself on a MegaZebra site, you may identify 
yourself through a social network account in which MegaZebra may receive
 additional information about your profile.</p>

<p>In each case, we will collect and record the information you have 
provided. Other than names and email addresses provided at your 
discretion, we don't generally collect any “Personally Identifying 
Information” about our users (such as social security number, telephone 
number, street address, drivers license number, etc.), exception being 
for billing and payments where we store your billing information such as
 name, street address, phone number. We may offer you the opportunity to
 submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, 
occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to 
collect that information from social networking systems on which you 
have used MegaZebra Games or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of 
use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy 
Policy.</p>

<p>In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share 
information about yourself in other content ("Content"), such as in 
games. Any action you perform with other players are considered public, 
and at your own discretion.</p>

<p>When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App
 on someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of 
that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is visible on 
your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use 
associated with that page.</p>

<p>Note that since most MegaZebra Software is served through SNS Apps, 
it is your responsibility to read and accept their Terms of Use, as well
 as Privacy Policy prior to continuing.</p>

<p>When you invite new members into your network or send messages 
through the Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the 
information associated with those messages, including email addresses 
and content.</p>

<p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, 
including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as 
blogs, instant messaging services, MegaZebra games and other users of 
MegaZebra, to supplement your profile.</p>

<p>MegaZebra may contain links to other websites. We are of course not 
responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage 
our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy 
statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to 
information collected by MegaZebra.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that most content delivered through 
MegaZebra games originates with another content provider. Such other 
content providers may place “cookies” on your browser, or otherwise 
gather information about you, including by asking you to provide 
information through the site itself.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow 
us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect
 aggregate information about the use of the Service, including 
information about users accessing the MegaZebra site or playing 
MegaZebra games or using SNS Apps on other sites, such as internet 
protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit 
pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, 
domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, 
the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time 
(“Activity Information”).</p>

<p>By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the 
above-described information in anonymous form as long as MegaZebra sees 
fit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Children Under The Age Of 13</strong></p>

<p>MegaZebra does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information 
from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to 
register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for 
MegaZebra or send any information about yourself to us, including your 
name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 
may provide any personal information to or on MegaZebra. In the event 
that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child 
under age 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If 
you believe that we might have any information from or about a child 
under 13, please contact us at 
 <a href="mailto:info@MegaZebra.com">info@MegaZebra.com</a> .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Children Between The Ages of 13 and 18</strong></p>

<p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for 
permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone 
over the Internet.</p>

<p>How We Use Your Information</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We do not sell or rent your “Personally Identifiable Information” to 
any third party. We may, however, use certain information about you that
 is not personally.</p>

<p>We use public information collected to determine the kinds of content
 that you would like to view and to assist any advertisers in targeting 
their advertising.</p>

<p>We also use your name, email address and other information on our 
system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and
 to solicit your feedback and input. Those emails will contain an 
“unsubscribe” link should you ever decide you do not want to receive 
further emails.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose 
any information we may have about you and the contents of your account 
if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, 
preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, 
to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, 
statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that 
of our affiliates or the public. MegaZebra is not required to question 
or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar
 governmental request that MegaZebra receives.</p>

<p>MegaZebra may maintain copies of your Content indefinitely, or delete
 certain Content in whole or in part if MegaZebra determines, in its 
sole discretion, that such Content constitutes an "Infringing Posting" 
or a "Prohibited Posting" as defined in our Terms of Use or for any or 
no reason.</p>

<p>We also use non-Personally Identifiable Information and certain 
technical information about your computer and your access of the Service
 (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, 
maintain and manage the Service.</p>

<p>MegaZebra may disclose information about you to its partners in order
 to provide the Service, resolve service problems and correct errors in 
the Service, to communicate with you about the Service, to provide you 
with advertising and promotional information in connection with the 
Service, and to enhance your experience on the Service. However, we do 
not give our partners an independent right to share this information.</p>

<p>Due to our contractual obligations with these third parties and the 
need to share information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot 
provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing information 
(whether Personally Identifiable Information or other information) with 
these third parties.</p>

<p>MegaZebra, certain of its partners, and each of their contractors and
 employees may view the Content that you transmit to the service to 
provide the Service and otherwise perform the tasks set forth in this 
Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Controlling Your Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing 
personal information, that information may be collected and used by 
others.</p>

<p>You can terminate your account at any time which will remove your 
profile and other personal information from view. MegaZebra, however, 
may (but is not obligated to) keep information about you that is on its 
system following your termination. Please contact MegaZebra to terminate
 your account or for any other questions about your personal 
information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Transfer of Information</strong></p>

<p>We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the 
event of a transfer of ownership of MegaZebra or the acquisition of 
substantially all the assets of MegaZebra related to the business which 
collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with 
another company. In such an event, MegaZebra will notify users who have 
provided email addresses when information about those users is 
transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Others' Information</strong></p>

<p>You may decide to provide us with another person's email address so 
that person may be invited to join MegaZebra or so that we may 
facilitate your communication with other people through the Service 
(such as when you upload an address book).</p>

<p>You may also provide us with another person's contact information for
 purposes of delivering information through SNS Apps. We use this 
information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he or 
she has been invited to join MegaZebra or received content through an 
SNS App. All invitees are provided with the option not to receive 
further invitations from MegaZebra. We may disclose such information if 
required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described 
above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>The Service sends "cookies" to your computer when you access the 
MegaZebra site, or otherwise view content through a MegaZebra game, or 
use an SNS App and the Service uses such cookies as described in here. 
The Service uses cookies to improve the quality of our service, make 
recommendations, and make the Service easier to use for our users. A 
cookie is a small text file recorded on your hard drive that identifies 
you as a unique user and contains certain information about your 
particular login session and/or your use of the Service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>

<p>MegaZebra may contain links to other web sites, and content in 
MegaZebra game and SNS Apps may be hosted by other web sites. In 
addition, as described above, most content offered through MegaZebra 
games or SNS Apps is served or hosted by other sites. These other sites 
maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use
 of personal information. It is up to you to review those policies 
yourself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Companies</strong></p>

<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site and
 on certain MegaZebra games and SNS Apps. Our system and the third-party
 advertising technology uses information derived from Activity 
Information, MegaZebra's cookies on your hard drive, your visits to our 
site, the MegaZebra games that you view and the SNS Apps you use to 
target advertising within our site or MegaZebra games or SNS Apps. In 
addition, our advertisers may use other third-party advertising 
technology to target advertising on our site and other sites. In the 
course of advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party 
cookie or cookies may be placed on your computer. Similarly, third-party
 advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called 
“clear gifs” or “beacons”) to help manage and optimize our online 
advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a 
browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn 
which banner ads bring users to a given site.</p>

<p>MegaZebra does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to
 third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser
 asks MegaZebra to show an advertisement to users with certain 
characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that 
group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories 
of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party 
advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of 
the audience that they are trying to reach.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>MegaZebra takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' 
information. Your account information is located on a secured server 
behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit 
card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure 
socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</a>).
 Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure 
communications, we request that you not send private information to us 
by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions about 
the security of MegaZebra Web Site, please contact us at 
 <a href="mailto:info@MegaZebra.com">info@MegaZebra.com</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Additional Questions</strong></p>

<p>Again, feel free to contact us by sending an email to 
 <a href="mailto:info@MegaZebra.com">info@MegaZebra.com</a> , any time, 
if you have further questions about MegaZebra or this Privacy Policy, or
 if you want to receive a previous version of this document.</p>
