          <li><strong>General       Introduction</strong> </li>
		    </ol>
		  <p>MegaTravelOffers.com (hereafter MTO) understands the  importance of keeping the information about you that you entrust to us  confidential and secure (“<strong>Customer  Information</strong>”). The information we collect may include your  personal information, in other words information capable of identifying you as  a particular individual, such as your name, phone number, email address,  shopping preferences, credit card information (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). We therefore make it our highest  priority to ensure that we look after your Customer Information and use it  responsibly. By visiting our website or one of our alternative distribution  channels as they evolve, or by providing your Customer Information to us or our  third party service providers over the telephone, by email or other  communication method (“<strong>Distribution  Channels</strong>”), you accept and consent to the collection, storage  and processing of your Customer Information as described in this Privacy  Policy.</p>
		  <ol start="2" type="1">
            <li><strong>Who Controls       your Customer Information?</strong> </li>
		    </ol>
		  <p>Customer Information collected by us is controlled by PentAfrica  Ltd (trading as ‘megatraveloffers.com’) with its registered office at P O Box 66377 –  00800 Nairobi, Kenya. <br>
		    Customer Information collected by MTO is stored in central databases, hosted in  our Nairobi Offices as well as on our servers in the USA.</p>
		  <ol start="3" type="1">
            <li><strong>What Personal       Information do we collect and how? </strong><br>
                <br>
              The MTO group collects Customer Information supplied by you and uses it to       provide you with a dynamic, personalised and secure service to offer you a       truly rewarding online experience. Although in certain instances, we will       require you to provide us with your Personal Information, for example, to       enable you to set up an account with us or purchase products or services       (and we will make it clear to you at the time what we need from you), you       can visit many pages on our website without the need to supply any       Personal Information. </li>
		    </ol>
		  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
		  <p><strong>MTO may collect  Personal Information about you</strong>: </p>
		  <ul type="disc">
            <li>when you register an account       with us</li>
		    <li>when you purchase products and/or       services</li>
		    <li>when you participate in       competitions, questionnaires and surveys</li>
		    <li>when you contact us or our       customer services personnel</li>
		    <li>via implicit data capture       measures when you visit the website, such as studying which pages you read       the most and through the use of cookies. </li>
		    <li>when you provide certain       content to MTO, for example testimonials and customer reviews</li>
		    <li>from third party sources, for       example credit checking agencies</li>
		    </ul>
		  <p>Examples of Personal Information we collect in each case  are: <br>
              <strong>Registration Information</strong><br>
		    You provide us with your username, password and email address when you register  an account on our website. Other details which you chose to provide in during  various online processes, such as bookings - for example name, contact  telephone numbers, marital status and other personal descriptions will also be  retained by us and treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
		  <p><strong>Purchaser Information</strong><br>
		    You provide us with your name, credit card details, including card number, card  type, cardholder name, expiry date, billing address and delivery details when  you place an order through our website or other Distribution Channels. </p>
		  <p><strong>Information from Competitions, Questionnaires and Surveys</strong><br>
		    When you complete questionnaires, surveys or competition entry forms you provide  us with your Personal Information including your name, street address, email  address and other information we might request. </p>
		  <p><strong>Contacting us</strong><br>
		    When you contact us by email, phone or post, for example dealing with our  customer service personnel, you provide us with your Personal Information for  example, name, email address etc. </p>
		  <p><strong>Implicit data capture</strong><br>
		    In addition to the information which you may volunteer to us, certain Customer  Information is automatically collected when you visit the MTO website via tracking  technologies employed by us from time to time such as cookies, flash cookies,  web bugs, javascript. These collect Customer Information including technical  information from your computer whenever you visit the website such as your  Internet protocol (IP) address, your operating system and platform, browser  type and version and referrer website as well as providing us with information  about your shopping preferences, viewed/searched-for products and on site  activity. The information collected by cookies and other tracking methods  placed by us is anonymous and does not contain your Personal Information but  will simply identify you as a specific number by reference to your hard drive.  If you are a wireless user and gain Internet access via a mobile phone you should  contact your wireless provider to find out if they collect Personal Information  about you. </p>
		  <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
		    Each website owned and operated by the MTO group uses cookies (small text files  containing a unique identification number). There are three types of cookies: </p>
		  <p><strong>Session cookies</strong><br>
		    These are used to maintain something called session state. If you consider your  journey through the website as a conversation with us, this cookie reminds the  site where we are in that conversation (for instance, if at some point in the  conversation you asked us to add a hotel to your basket, next time you click on  the basket it will still be there). Session cookies are required for the  website to function but are not used in any way to identify you personally. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Permanent cookies </strong><br>
		    When you visit our website, we will assign a permanent cookie on the hard drive  of your computer. You can view these by looking in the cookies directory of  your browser installation. As the name implies, permanent cookies last for a  long time and each time you visit our website you send us a copy of them  allowing us to identify you from visit to visit. For instance, if you were  looking at hotels in London  last time you were on the website and the next time you visit us we have a  great hotel deal, this cookie enables us to recognise you, so that we can show  you that deal. The aim is to enhance your experience whilst on the website and  make sure you don’t miss out on great offers. Cookies do not contain any  Personal Information for example, your name, address, email address, or  telephone number, but simply a unique identification number that identifies  your computer to us. </p>
		  <p><strong>Third party tracking devices</strong><br>
		    You will see that we carry advertising relating to third parties on our  website. This advertising is served either directly by third party advertisers  or on their behalf by advertising network companies. These advertisers or  advertising networks may place cookies, action tags or other tracking devices  on your hard drive to assess the effectiveness of their ads. They may aggregate  information about your visits to our website and other websites retrieved via  such cookies with other information that you may have provided directly to the  relevant advertiser or ad network. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of  cookies and other tracking devices by third parties. This will be covered by  that third party’s privacy policies and practice and we would recommend that  you take a look at these which in most cases will be found on that company’s  website. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Opting out</strong> <br>
		    Although you cannot block "session" cookies as they are required for  our website to function correctly you can configure your Internet browser so  that it can reject both "permanent" and "third party"  cookies. How you do this will depend upon the Internet browser you use (for  example, Internet Explorer 5, Netscape 4 or Opera etc). Please refer to the  relevant Internet browser manufacturer's website where you should be able to  receive all the information you need. </p>
		  <p><strong>Information from other sources </strong><br>
		    We may receive information about you from other sources, for example from  credit reference agencies to guard against fraud or address, delivery  information from third parties engaged for record correction purposes etc. </p>
		  <ol start="4" type="1">
            <li><strong>How do we use       your Customer Information?</strong> </li>
		    </ol>
		  <p>MTO will use your Customer Information for a number of  different purposes including: </p>
		  <ul type="disc">
            <li>For registering with megatraveloffers.com</li>
		    <li>For fulfilling orders</li>
		    <li>For responding to your queries </li>
		    <li>For improving your onsite       experience and providing you with information about products and services,       special offers and promotions.</li>
		    <li>For internal operations and       analysis</li>
		    </ul>
		  <p><strong>Registration</strong><br>
		    We will use the information that you provide to us when you register as a  member on the website to set up and maintain your account. We will send you a confirmation  email notifying you that your account has been set up. We may also obtain  information about you from other sources and add this to your account profile  for example, updated delivery details from couriers. </p>
		  <p><strong>Fulfilling orders</strong><br>
		    When you place an order for products or services via the website or other  Distribution Channels, we will use your purchase information to process the  requested transaction, fulfill your order and provide you with the products and  services you expect. </p>
		  <p><strong>Responding to communications</strong><br>
		    We may use your Customer Information to respond to your queries for example,  about an order or problems logging on, navigating the website or accessing Your  Account. In order to address your query, you may be contacted by email, over  the telephone, or other communication method by a member of one of our customer  services teams. We may also use your contact details to send you follow up  information about a booking (for example, regarding changes to booked travel or  unavoidable travel disruptions affecting your journey in order to help you make  alternative travel arrangements). We may contact you via email, phone or other  communication channel to respond to suggestions you may send to us (for example  about our website, products and services) and to assess and announce the  results of surveys, competitions and other contests you may have participated  in. For quality assurance and training reasons we may record some of our  telephone calls with our customers. Some information including customer e-mails  received by MTO may be used by us for testimonials though your Personal  Information, such as e-mail address or contact details, will never be displayed  publicly by us. </p>
		  <p><strong>Improving your shopping experience</strong><br>
		    We use the information gathered from your permanent cookie file (see <em>Cookies </em>above) in conjunction with other  Customer Information provided by you, so that we can create a more effective  website by assessing content and traffic flows on the site. We use this  information to provide you with a more personalised experience on the website,  help you to navigate the site effortlessly and to display particular products  and services that we believe may be of interest to you.<br>
		    When you register Your Account or place an order via our website or other  Distribution Channel, we may use your Customer Information to contact you with  details of special offers, promotions and other information and to send you our  newsletters where we think these will be of interest.&nbsp; You can change your  preferences and unsubscribe for such communications at any time by through your  Account settings or by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of emails you  receive from us. </p>
		  <p><strong>Internal administration and fraud  prevention</strong><br>
		    We may also use your Customer Information for internal administration, analysis  and quality assurance purposes, including fraud prevention. <br>
		    We use your Customer Information to help us guard against fraud. When you make  a booking or purchase products or services offered on our website, we will  automatically pass certain Customer Information which you provide to us (for  example, your name, credit card, billing address details) to third party credit  reference agencies, payment processors or other third parties for the specific  purpose of verifying that information. If your Customer Information cannot be  satisfactorily verified (for example, your stated billing address does not  match your credit card details), we will contact you to notify you that your  purchase request has not been confirmed and to request corrected details, if  they can be provided, before we can process your order. </p>
		  <ol start="5" type="1">
            <li><strong>Who do we       share your information with and why?</strong> </li>
		    </ol>
		  <p>We are happy to say that we are not in the business of  selling or renting your Customer Information to third parties. MTO does however  share your Customer Information with its group companies or carefully selected  third party partners and providers as necessary for business administration,  customer delivery, marketing and operational, analytical or other purposes as  set out below. Except with your expressly given consent, we will only share  your Customer Information as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
		  <p><strong>Third party suppliers and group companies</strong><br>
		    MTO engages other group companies and/or carefully selected third party  partners, including service providers, joint venture partners and outsource  providers to perform various functions on our behalf. To the extent required to  perform such functions on our behalf, these companies may process your Customer  Information. Such functions include, processing bookings and confirming  reservations for products and services and providing associated information  (for example, local area information relating to a hotel booking), delivering  products and services, processing credit card payments, providing search  results, communicating with you, including providing customer service, via  telephone, email, post or otherwise and for promotional activities.<br>
		    We may also share your Customer Information with third parties for the purpose  of data analysis, quality assurance (including fraud prevention) and, though  this will not include your Personal Information, for marketing assistance (for  example, to explore consumer trends). <br>
		    Various pages on our website contain links (including via ads) to third party  websites. Once you have exited our website via such a link, any further data  you provide will be collected by or on behalf of the third party responsible  for that website and therefore subject to the privacy policy and practices of  that third party rather than to this Privacy Policy. We cannot be responsible  for any third party’s use of your Customer Information and recommend that you  check the specific terms on the relevant third party’s websites relating to the  use and disclosure of your Customer Information. <br>
		    To the extent that any third party has access to your Personal Information to  provide functions on our behalf, their use of this information will be limited  solely to providing those functions and for no other purpose. Any Personal  Information processed by our group companies will be in accordance with the  terms of this Privacy Policy or similarly stringent conditions and as permitted  under applicable data protection laws. We place contractual restrictions on our  non-group third party partners who receive your Personal Information, to ensure  that they use this in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data  protection laws. </p>
		  <p><strong>Business restructuring</strong><br>
		    Like any other organisation, from time to time MTO may restructure its business  operations by selling one or more of its businesses (or part of a business) to  a buyer either within or outside the MTO group. In such transactions, your  Customer Information could be transferred as part of the relevant sale. If this  is the case, we would contact you to let you know. </p>
		  <p><strong>Compliance with laws and regulations</strong> <br>
		    We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties, such as official  bodies and our professional advisers, as far as we believe necessary (i) to  comply with relevant laws, orders or regulations, (ii) to enforce our customer  terms and conditions of use or other contractual agreements and (iii) to  protect the property and other rights of MTO, its group companies, customers  and others (for example, in any way relating to protection against fraudulent  activities in respect of MTO). </p>
		  <ol start="6" type="1">
            <li><strong>How do we       keep your Customer Information secure?</strong> </li>
		    </ol>
		  <p>In the Kenya  we operate and are registered in accordance with applicable Kenya data  protection legislation. <br>
		    We use leading technological and security measures (both electronic, physical  and procedural) to ensure the safety and confidentiality of our Customer  Information through collection, storage and disclosure. Such measures include  maintaining a secure encryption based transmission system, intrusion detection  and prevention software and virus protection software in respect of Customer  Information. Other than as strictly required by our payment providers and by  our credit card companies to process payments, MTO reveals only the last 5  digits of your stored credit card number to authorised personnel only. </p>
		  <ol start="7" type="1">
            <li><strong>How can you       control your Customer Information?</strong> </li>
		    </ol>
		  <p>MTO understands that it is important that you have control  over your Customer Information. <br>
		    You can view and change Your Account settings and information, including your  contact email address by visiting the ‘<em>Manage  your personal and site details</em>’ section in Your Acount on the  website. In particular, if you do not want to receive special offers and  promotional communications from MTO you can set your preferences to opt out via  Your Account or by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of emails you  receive from us. </p>
		  <ol start="8" type="1">
            <li><strong>Changes to       this Privacy Policy</strong> </li>
		    </ol>
		  <p>MTO may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time  and will notify you of any material changes by displaying the revised Privacy  Policy on our website. </p>

/**
This is a JavaScript library that will allow you to easily add some basic DHTML
drop-down datepicker functionality to your Notes forms. This script is not as
full-featured as others you may find on the Internet, but it's free, it's easy to
understand, and it's easy to change.

You'll also want to include a stylesheet that makes the datepicker elements
look nice. An example one can be found in the database that this script was
originally released with, at:

http://www.nsftools.com/tips/NotesTips.htm#datepicker

I've tested this lightly with Internet Explorer 6 and Mozilla Firefox. I have no idea
how compatible it is with other browsers.

version 1.5
December 4, 2005
Julian Robichaux -- http://www.nsftools.com

HISTORY
--  version 1.0 (Sept. 4, 2004):
Initial release.

--  version 1.1 (Sept. 5, 2004):
Added capability to define the date format to be used, either globally (using the
defaultDateSeparator and defaultDateFormat variables) or when the displayDatePicker
function is called.

--  version 1.2 (Sept. 7, 2004):
Fixed problem where datepicker x-y coordinates weren't right inside of a table.
Fixed problem where datepicker wouldn't display over selection lists on a page.
Added a call to the datePickerClosed function (if one exists) after the datepicker
is closed, to allow the developer to add their own custom validation after a date
has been chosen. For this to work, you must have a function called datePickerClosed
somewhere on the page, that accepts a field object as a parameter. See the
example in the comments of the updateDateField function for more details.

--  version 1.3 (Sept. 9, 2004)
Fixed problem where adding the <div> and <iFrame> used for displaying the datepicker
was causing problems on IE 6 with global variables that had handles to objects on
the page (I fixed the problem by adding the elements using document.createElement()
and document.body.appendChild() instead of document.body.innerHTML += ...).

--  version 1.4 (Dec. 20, 2004)
Added "targetDateField.focus();" to the updateDateField function (as suggested
by Alan Lepofsky) to avoid a situation where the cursor focus is at the top of the
form after a date has been picked. Added "padding: 0px;" to the dpButton CSS
style, to keep the table from being so wide when displayed in Firefox.

-- version 1.5 (Dec 4, 2005)
Added display=none when datepicker is hidden, to fix problem where cursor is
not visible on input fields that are beneath the date picker. Added additional null
date handling for date errors in Safari when the date is empty. Added additional
error handling for iFrame creation, to avoid reported errors in Opera. Added
onMouseOver event for day cells, to allow color changes when the mouse hovers
over a cell (to make it easier to determine what cell you're over). Added comments
in the style sheet, to make it more clear what the different style elements are for.
*/

var datePickerDivID = "datepicker";
var iFrameDivID = "datepickeriframe";

var dayArrayShort = new Array('Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa');
var dayArrayMed = new Array('Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat');
var dayArrayLong = new Array('Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday');
var monthArrayShort = new Array('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec');
var monthArrayMed = new Array('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'Aug', 'Sept', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec');
var monthArrayLong = new Array('January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December');
 
// these variables define the date formatting we're expecting and outputting.
// If you want to use a different format by default, change the defaultDateSeparator
// and defaultDateFormat variables either here or on your HTML page.
var defaultDateSeparator = "/";        // common values would be "/" or "."
var defaultDateFormat = "mdy"    // valid values are "mdy", "dmy", and "ymd"
var dateSeparator = defaultDateSeparator;
var dateFormat = defaultDateFormat;

/**
This is the main function you'll call from the onClick event of a button.
Normally, you'll have something like this on your HTML page:

Start Date: <input name="StartDate">
<input type=button value="select" onclick="displayDatePicker('StartDate');">

That will cause the datepicker to be displayed beneath the StartDate field and
any date that is chosen will update the value of that field. If you'd rather have the
datepicker display beneath the button that was clicked, you can code the button
like this:

<input type=button value="select" onclick="displayDatePicker('StartDate', this);">

So, pretty much, the first argument (dateFieldName) is a string representing the
name of the field that will be modified if the user picks a date, and the second
argument (displayBelowThisObject) is optional and represents an actual node
on the HTML document that the datepicker should be displayed below.

In version 1.1 of this code, the dtFormat and dtSep variables were added, allowing
you to use a specific date format or date separator for a given call to this function.
Normally, you'll just want to set these defaults globally with the defaultDateSeparator
and defaultDateFormat variables, but it doesn't hurt anything to add them as optional
parameters here. An example of use is:

<input type=button value="select" onclick="displayDatePicker('StartDate', false, 'dmy', '.');">

This would display the datepicker beneath the StartDate field (because the
displayBelowThisObject parameter was false), and update the StartDate field with
the chosen value of the datepicker using a date format of dd.mm.yyyy
