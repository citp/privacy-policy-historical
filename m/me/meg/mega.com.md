## Collection of personal information - Cookies

### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a person’s computer as they navigate through different websites. The collection of cookies helps us understand how our website is being used, user behavior, and also tells us which parts of our website have been visited.

Cookie collection facilitates and measures the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Cookies are stored for 13 months, unless the person decides to delete them before the end of that term.

At MEGA, we treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
