                        <h4>Our Business</h4>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>Beachfront Media, LLC has a video platform.</strong> We use our proprietary
                            technology to offer advertising solutions to our clients, which includes working with
                            advertisers to deliver their advertising campaigns across our network of publishers and
                            application (“app”) developers (our “Platform”).<br>
                            We offer products and services that help online publishers, agencies, and ad networks manage
                            and deliver online advertising in their videos. We also own websites, and offer technology
                            that allows content providers to place their content into applications. As a consumer, when
                            you see an advertisement before you watch a video, we may help deliver that ad from or for
                            an advertiser to the website or application that has made the video available to you. We
                            also provide a marketplace, where buyers and sellers of online video advertising space can
                            connect and do business.<br>
                            We are not in the business of collecting, using, or selling consumer data; however we do
                            offer tools and technologies to advertisers and publishers that allow them to collect and
                            use user data. This is done primarily to enable these buyers and sellers of online
                            video-advertising space to try and ensure that the audience they desire sees their ads and
                            that the advertising itself is delivered and the performance of the advertising can be
                            analyzed. Types of data that may be used for this purpose range from behavioral or
                            interest-related information to geographical or demographic user data. We adhere to the NAI
                            Code of Conduct.</p>

                        <p>Personally-Identifiable Information.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>We do not collect personally-identifiable information in order to help our clients buy, sell,
                            and deliver online video advertising. “Personally-Identifiable Information”
                            means information that alone or when in combination with other information We collect may be
                            used to readily identify, contact, or locate you. There may be some opportunities, for

                            we are doing so that you can choose not to provide it.</p>

                            cannot be linked to a specific individual by us. We may collect non-personally-identifiable

                            publishers (collectively, “”customers”). For example, while providing the Services to
                            website publishers, advertisers and those working for them, we may collect your IP address,
                            Web pages that you visit, the time and date, and whether or not you clicked on various
                            advertisements (collectively, “Web Surfing Data”).</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>We use different types of technologies to collect non-personally-identifiable information,

                        <p><strong>Opt-Out Procedure and Cookie Control</strong></p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Should you wish to opt-out of us placing a cookie on your browser, you can <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">click
                                here</a> to deploy an “opt-out” cookie on your browser. This cookie, when
                            installed on your browser, will prevent us from placing a new cookie on that browser and
                            from collecting data on that browser. The NAI’s opt-out tool also allows you to
                            opt-out of the data collection and targeted ad programs of other NAI members. You may access
                            the NAI opt-out <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">tool here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Our opt-out tool and the NAI opt-out tool, are cookie-based. Both opt-out tools only prevent
                            us from collecting data pertaining to you on the browser on which they are installed, and
                            will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies. If you delete an
                            opt-out cookie from a browser’s cookie files, we may collect data and place a new
                            cookie unless an opt-out cookie is reset on that browser. If you block third-party cookies
                            from being set on your browser, you may not be able to enjoy some features or functionality,
                            and you may see the same content and advertisements repeatedly on some websites.</p>

                        <p>Text from the Android Developers Guide is below:</p>

                            <p>The advertising ID is a unique but user-resettable string identifier that lets ad
                                networks and other apps anonymously identify a user. The user’s advertising ID is
                                made available to apps through APIs provided in Google Play services.</p>

                            <p>Users can reset their advertising ID at any time, right from the Ads section of the
                                Google Settings app on their devices. From the same app, users can also opt-out of
                                targeted advertising based on the advertising ID by setting the appropriate ad tracking
                                preference. When the user opts-out of targeted ads, this ad tracking preference is made
                                available to apps through a Google Play services API.</p>

                            <p>Apps making use of the advertising ID must check for and respect the user’s ad
                                tracking preference. Also please note that any use of the advertising ID must abide by
                                the terms of the Google Play Developer Content Policies.</p>

                            cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times
                            you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness
                            of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your
                            mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device:
                            http://oo.apple.com. Alternatively, if you are using iOS 6 or above operating system on your
                            mobile device, you may opt-out by electing Limit Ad Tracking (Learn More). If you opt out,
                            you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant
                            because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the
                            content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information.
                            Opting out through oo.apple.com applies only to Apple advertising services and does not
                            affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks. However, if you select
                            Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third party apps are not permitted by contract to
                            use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier to serve you targeted ads.
