# Mequoda Privacy Policy - Mequoda Daily

Mequoda Group, LLC is committed to protecting and maintaining your privacy. We understand that it is a privilege for us to be trusted with your personal information. To get full access to our services, we ask you to give us information that we understand is very important to you. Therefore, we want you to know exactly what information is collected, why we collect it, how we protect it, and how you can access or change it.

This policy covers only the information collected on the Mequoda.com domain. Sites that link to  
or from our site are not covered by this policy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every site that you visit. To ensure your comfort with Mequoda, this policy is linked to every page where we ask for information on our site. To change or access your personally identifiable information (PII) please email [customercare@mequoda.com](mailto:customercare@mequoda.com) or click the “Log In” link on the right side of the Mequoda Daily or Mequoda Library.

We are continuously improving our site and our services to you. Whenever a new feature to our service requires a change to this policy, we will post a clear notice on all the pages of our site where the privacy policy appears. The principle behind this policy and our business is to only collect information with your knowledge and consent.

**The Information We Collect**

This policy refers to all information collected on the Mequoda.com domain. On our site, there are pages where we ask you to enter information in order to receive specific services.

When you register we will collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, email address, billing address, phone number and credit-card information.

**How We Use This Information**

When you first register with us on the Mequoda.com domain, we ask for your email address and a password. Once you supply this information, you will be able to receive emails promoting content for our issues, important information about our site, about your subscription to our reports, or other offers or promotions. All information sent via email will come directly from Mequoda.com, and you may call us or use the unsibscribe link in your email to remove your address from our list at any time. We will never sell or rent your information to anyone else. All information on current and former members is retained in our database solely for customer service and accounting purposes.

Also, we may occasionally offer surveys to help us better serve you. If and when you choose to participate in these optional surveys, you may also receive special offers via email. If you would rather not receive these special offers, simply email [customercare@mequoda.com](mailto:customercare@mequoda.com) to cancel at any time. Any information you give us by taking part in a survey will be treated with the same strict concerns for privacy as all member information is treated.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Mequoda Group, LLC does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your permission. Mequoda may partner with companies who wish to offer our services to their current customers, prospective customers, mailing list members and site visitors. These companies offer our services under their brand name, and if you choose to sign up for our services under the brand name of our partner company, we may share personally identifiable information with that company. Every time you sign up for a service, on our site or a partner company’s site, we will notify you of the privacy policy and how you can opt-out of our services.

Also, we will never sell, share or rent information we receive from other companies about you to outside parties. We may use this information ourselves, only to personalize and enhance the content of your Mequoda subscription.

**Credit/Debit Card Information**

Credit/debit card information is never shared with outside parties for promotional or other purposes.  
When you subscribe to our services, we will ask for your billing address, your phone number and credit/debit card information. This will be used only to process your order. Your phone number will be used only in the event of a problem. We will not share your credit/debit card information with anyone else.

**Children’s Information**

We do not knowingly collect or maintain information at our website from children under the age of  
13, and no part of our website is structured to attract those under 13.

**Cookies**

The Mequoda.com domain uses cookies every time you visit our site. Cookies are used to remember  
information you have already entered, for instance your password, so that you will not have to re-enter them every time you visit. We never use cookies to collect additional personally identifiable information about you. You can ask your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent if you do not wish to accept cookies. You can also manually delete all cookie files from your computer. We use them only to make you visit to our site more enjoyable.

**IP Addresses**

This site uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements inside the site, determine which site referred users to us, and gather very general demographic information. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**What You Should Know Concerning The Future**

Mequoda is committed to your privacy. However, if Mequoda is ever acquired by another company, all of our assets, including information we’ve gathered, become the property of the new owner. If this happens, the new owner’s policies may override this Privacy Policy. Also, if Mequoda ever goes out of business, all its assets, including the information we have gathered, may be sold or dissolved.
