**Technology Used in the Online Collection of Information/Cookies**  
We may collect and store information about your visit to our Web site. To collect this information, our web server may write a "cookie," which is a small file, to your hard drive. We may use cookies to enhance your online experience, to facilitate your use of our Web site and to collect anonymous, aggregated site-visitation statistics which we can use to measure the effectiveness of, and to improve, not only our Web site but our products and services.   
If you register for certain personalized services, or choose to save personal information on our Web site, such information may be stored in a cookie.

This also makes your repeated online interactions with us easier by allowing you to avoid re-entering your log-in or other information each time you visit our Web site.   
The cookies also allow Men4Now to monitor, on an anonymous, collective basis, information such as:  
· The Internet service providers that our members and visitors use.   
· The type of browsers, such as Microsoft Explorer or Netscape, that our customers and visitors use.   
· The Internet Protocol addresses of our customers and visitors.

· The number of first-time visitors and return customers to our Web site.   
This information helps us monitor our Web site and ensures that it is accessible to customers and visitors. This information also helps us develop content and services that offer the best value and most benefits to our members and visitors.

**Technology Used in the Online Collection of Information/Tracer Technologies**  
Tracer, or spotlighting, technologies may also be used by Men4Now or its service providers. Tracers are tiny, invisible graphics that tag content to collect anonymous site-visitation statistics and track the effectiveness of certain marketing campaigns like banner advertisements and e-mail. We review the collected information on an anonymous aggregated, or group, basis without any personally identifiable consumer information.   
Tracers are used by Men4Now or our service providers to:   
· Provide usage measurements for some portions of our Web site.   
· Track the number of times our Web site is accessed from a Men4Now advertisement placed on a third party's Web site.   
· Trace a hyperlink to our Web site provided in an e-mail message distributed by us or on our behalf revealing whether such visitors subsequently apply online for, are approved for and/or use a Men4Now product or service.   
· Monitor the number of our customers who open particular e-mail messages that they choose to receive.   
Tracer technology may also be used to determine whether a customer who has opted to receive informational e-mails from Men4Now is capable of reading e-mails sent in HTML format. We prefer to send e-mails in HTML format since it allows customers to view better graphics and improves the customer experience. The e-mail address of each customer that is identified as being capable of reading HTML formatted e-mails is marked "HTML-capable" and subsequent e-mails are sent to the customer in HTML format. If an e-mail address is not HTML-capable, subsequent e-mails are sent in text or AOL format. 

**Information Storage**  
If you submit an application or form to us online, or request an online transaction, Men4Now may store the information you send in an electronic database. Men4Now uses security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data stored in our systems.

**Third-Party Web Sites**  
Our Web site contains links to third-party sites that you may find useful. These sites may have their own privacy policies. You should review the privacy policy of any Web site before you provide personal or confidential information.
