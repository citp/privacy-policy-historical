You will be subject to the terms and conditions in force at the time that you place an Order through us.</span></p>

Responsibility: You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your Internet connection are aware of these Website Terms and that they comply with them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3. YOUR STATUS</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.1. Capacity and age: By placing an Order through the Website, you warrant that:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.1.1. You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.1.2. You are at least 18 years old.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.2. Alcohol and cigarettes: Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.2.1. it is an offence for any person under the age of 18 to buy, or attempt to buy, intoxicating liquor, or for any person over the age of 18 to buy intoxicating liquor on behalf of any person under the age of 18;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.2.2. Cigarettes are not for sale to persons under the age of 18; and</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.2.3. Orders containing either alcohol or cigarettes can therefore not be accepted from or on behalf of persons under the age of 18. In the event that you place an order for alcohol or tobacco products, you will be required by the restaurant to show ID on delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, if your Order includes alcohol or tobacco, the Restaurant is providing you with these and Menulog is not selling alcohol or tobacco to you. Menulog supports the Responsible Service of Alcohol.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4. HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.1. Compiling your Order: Once you select the Products you wish to order from the menu of your chosen Restaurant and provide other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order by clicking or selecting the "</span><span style="color: #797876;">proceed</span><span style="color: #797876;">", "</span><span style="color: #797876;">place my order</span><span style="color: #797876;">", "</span><span style="color: #797876;">checkout</span><span style="color: #797876;">" or similar button. It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so we will process your Order and errors cannot be corrected.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.2. Minimum Order Amount: If a Restaurant has a minimum order amount in place, you may not place an order with that Restaurant until the value of your Order exceeds that amount. The minimum order amount must be met after applying any discounts or specials that reduce the total Order amount.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.3. Amending or cancelling your Order: Once you submit your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order online (please refer to paragraph 4.4 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders). If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you may contact the Restaurant directly or our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started to process your Order.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.4. Payment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed by or communicated to the relevant Restaurant.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.5. Processing your Order and Restaurant rejections: On receipt of your Order, we will begin processing it by sending it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed. Any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each merely indicate that your Order has been received and is being processed by us, and does not necessarily mean that your Order has been accepted by the Restaurant. Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order.&nbsp; When a Restaurant confirms receipt of the order and expected collection or delivery time, we will send you an SMS confirmation (provided that you have given us your mobile telephone number).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.6. Delivery of your Order: Estimated times for deliveries and collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates. Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for collection within the estimated times. All food preparation and deliveries are the sole responsibility of the Restaurant accepting the Order. To the extent permitted by law, including the Australian Consumer Law, Menulog accepts no liability associated with food preparation or delivery by the Restaurant accepting the order.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">5. PRICE AND PAYMENT</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">5.1. Taxes and delivery costs: Prices for individual menu items will be as quoted on the Website in Australian dollars. These prices include any applicable taxes but may exclude delivery costs (if you opt for delivery instead of collection) and any online payment administration charge imposed by the Restaurant (if you pay for your Order online). These will be added to the total amount due where applicable.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">5.2. Incorrect pricing: This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices. The products will be sold for the displayed price even if the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">5.3. Payment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the Restaurant at the point of delivery to you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">5.4. Card payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card conforms with the receipt data for the Order.

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.1. Your information will enable us to provide you with access to the relevant parts of the Website and to supply the Service.

We will also use and analyse the information we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business, for any other purpose whether statistical or analytical and to help us prevent fraud. Where appropriate, now and in the future you may have the ability to express your preferences around the use of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy and this may be exercised though your chosen method of using the Service, for example mobile, mobile applications or any representation of the Website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.2. We may use your information to contact you for your views on the Service and to notify you occasionally about important changes or developments to the Website or the Service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.3. Where you have indicated accordingly by giving your consent, you agree that we may use your information to let you know about our other products and services that may be of interest to you including services that may be the subject of direct marketing and we may contact you to do so by post, telephone, mobile messaging (e.g. SMS, MMS etc.) as well as by e-mail in accordance with the Spam Act and the Privacy Act.&nbsp;</span></p>

Where we disclose your personal information to overseas recipients, we will always take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is treated in accordance with this policy and the Australian Privacy Principles.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.2. The third parties with whom we share your information may undertake various activities such as processing credit card payments and providing support services for us. In addition, we may need to provide your information to any Restaurants that you have placed an Order with so as to allow the Restaurant to process and deliver your Order. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.3. If our business enters into a joint venture with, purchases or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, our new business partners or owners or their advisors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.4.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and prevention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4. SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.1. We take steps to protect your information from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure and against misuse, interference, loss, destruction and damage. Once your information is no longer required for any purpose for which it may be used or disclosed by us, and we are not required by law to retain the information, we will destroy the information or ensure that it is de-identified.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.2. Where you have registered an account with Menulog and chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone. Unless we negligently disclose your password to a third party, we will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.3. All user details captured by Menulog are stored securely at all times and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties. All credit card details are protected using SSL (</span><span style="color: #797876;">Secure Socket Layer</span><span style="color: #797876;">) encryption. Menulog has been verified for security and compliance to PCI standards by Vectra Corporation, an independent third party. Credit card details are handled by leading PCI compliant providers of secure credit card processing solutions. Menulog will never save your actual credit card details. We will simply save a reference to your card, which is called a token.&nbsp; This token is provided to us by the payment provider. Saving the token means that for future credit card transactions we can give you the option to charge the same card you used previously without having to re-enter the card details. If, at any time, you wish the token to be removed please email us at enquiries@menulog.com and we will have these removed. In that case you would need to re-enter your card details on the next order.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.4. However, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take reasonable steps to protect your information and make sure it is safe and secure and we use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk. For the avoidance of doubt, Menulog will not in any circumstances be liable to you, or third parties, for loss or damage arising from credit card fraud or identity theft.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">General</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">1. The following general terms and conditions (the "</span><span style="color: #797876;">General Voucher Terms</span><span style="color: #797876;">") will apply to all vouchers issued by Menulog from time to time for use on the Website ("</span><span style="color: #797876;">Vouchers</span><span style="color: #797876;">").</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2. Individual Vouchers will also be subject to, and the General Voucher Terms will be supplemented and/or modified by, additional terms and conditions (the "</span><span style="color: #797876;">Specific Voucher Terms</span><span style="color: #797876;">") that will be specified on the Voucher or at the time the Voucher is issued.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3. Vouchers may only be redeemed towards online Orders from Restaurants made through the Website. The code provided with the Voucher is to be entered at the end of checkout process. The final amount owing after a Voucher has been applied will be shown at the top of the credit card entry page and any remaining balance must be paid by credit or debit card&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4. Vouchers can only be purchased from a verified Menulog account, and are subject to a maximum purchase limit of $200 per day per verified Menulog account. A verified Menulog account is an account with at least one completed order older than 24 hours. To purchase a Menulog Gift Voucher simply go to: </span><a href="http://www.menulog.com.au/voucher"><span style="color: #797876;">www.menulog.com.au/voucher</span></a><span style="color: #797876;">.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">5. Subject to the Australian Consumer Law, Vouchers purchased through Menulog cannot be exchanged or refunded, and are valid for such period specified at the time of issue of the Voucher. Menulog reserves the right to cancel any voucher any time without notice. To the extent required by law, including the Australian Consumer Law, Menulog will provide a remedy if it cancels a Voucher.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">6. Vouchers are not available for redemption at Restaurants that display "</span><span style="color: #797876;">Vouchers Not Accepted</span><span style="color: #797876;">", and may be valid at other Restaurants only under certain conditions (for example, first time Menulog customers). One gift voucher cannot be used for more than one order and the full amount must be used in one transaction (no change will be given). Alcohol restrictions apply. Menulog reserves the right to charge the value of the voucher to your allotted credit card if we determine that the voucher was redeemed contrary to the terms of use.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">7. The right to use a Voucher is personal to the intended recipient and may not be transferred. No Voucher may be copied, reproduced, distributed, or published directly or indirectly in any form or by any means for use by an entity other than the original recipient, or stored in a data retrieval system, without our prior written permission. In particular, Vouchers distributed or circulated without our written approval, for example on an Internet message board or on a "bargains" website, are not valid for use and may be refused or cancelled.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">8. Unless otherwise provided or specified in the Specific Voucher Terms:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">8.1 Vouchers may not be used in conjunction with other Vouchers or any other discounts or promotions provided or advertised from time to time;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">8.2 each Voucher will be valid for use by a recipient only once;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">8.3 each customer or household is limited to one Voucher per promotion or offer; and</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">8.4 the right to use a Voucher is personal to the original recipient and may not be transferred.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">9. When you use a Voucher you warrant to us that you are the duly authorised recipient of the Voucher and that you are using it in accordance with these terms, lawfully, legally and in good faith.

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">We are committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors to the Website, including all visitors who access the Website or</span><span style="color: #666666;"> Service through any mobile application or other platform or device. Please read the following Privacy Policy which explains how we use and</span><span style="color: #797876;"> protect your information.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">By visiting and/or using the Service on the Website, you agree and, where required, you consent to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and transfer of your information as set out in this policy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">1. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT FROM YOU</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">1.1. When you visit the Website or use the Service to make an Order from a Restaurant through the Website, you may be asked to provide information about yourself including your name, address, contact details (such as telephone and mobile numbers and e-mail address) and payment information (such as credit or debit card information). We may also collect information about your usage of the Website and Service and information about you from the materials (such as messages and reviews) you post to the Website and the e-mails or letters you send to us. Your telephone calls to us may also be recorded for training and quality purposes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">1.2. By accessing Menulog information and/or the Website or Service using mobile digital routes such as (but not limited to) mobile, tablet or other devices/technology including mobile applications, then you should expect that our data collection and usage as set out in this Privacy Policy will apply in that context too. We may collect technical information from your mobile device or your use of the Website or the Service through a mobile device, for example, location data and certain characteristics of, and performance data about, your device, carrier/operating system including device and connection type, IP address, mobile payment methods, interaction with other retail technology such as use of NFC Tags, QR Codes or use of mobile vouchers. Unless you have elected to remain anonymous through your device and/or platform settings, this information may be collected and used by us automatically if you use the Website or Service through your mobile device(s) via any Menulog mobile application, through your mobile's browser or otherwise.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.1. Your information will enable us to provide you with access to the relevant parts of the Website and to supply the Service. It will also enable us to bill you and enable us and/or a Restaurant with whom you have placed an Order to contact you where necessary concerning the Service. For example, we and/or the Restaurant may use your information to provide you with status updates or other information regarding your Order by e-mail, telephone, mobile or mobile messaging (e.g. SMS, MMS etc.). We will also use and analyse the information we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business, for any other purpose whether statistical or analytical and to help us prevent fraud. Where appropriate, now and in the future you may have the ability to express your preferences around the use of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy and this may be exercised though your chosen method of using the Service, for example mobile, mobile applications or any representation of the Website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.2. We may use your information to contact you for your views on the Service and to notify you occasionally about important changes or developments to the Website or the Service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.3. When you register with Menulog, you consent to Menulog using your personal information for direct marketing purposes to communicate with you by phone, email or SMS and, if you use our mobile application, via push notification, to tell you about offers, updates and our products and services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">You may choose to stop receiving direct marketing communications from a channel at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the marketing communication itself. To opt-out of communications via email click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email and to opt-out of communications by SMS reply with "STOP". You may also decline marketing messaging sent by push notifications by refusing the relevant permission to our app in your phone or tablet settings, however this will also prevent you from receiving order updates via push.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.4. Where you have given express consent, you agree that we may also share information with third parties (including those in the food, drink, leisure, marketing and advertising sectors) to use your information in order to let you know about goods and services which may be of interest to you (by post, telephone, mobile messaging (e.g. SMS, MMS etc.) and/or e-mail) in accordance with the Spam Act and the Privacy Act.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">We may also disclose your information to help us analyse the information which we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business and services to you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.5. You agree that we may disclose personal information which we collect from you to other companies that also hold information about you.&nbsp; We may also collect personal information from those other companies. We and/or those companies may combine the information in order to better understand your preferences and interests, thereby enabling them and us to serve you better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.6 If you do not want us to use your data in this way or change your mind about being contacted in the future, please let us know by using the contact details set out in paragraph 8 below, by amending your profile accordingly or by using the opt-out facilities provided (eg an unsubscribe link).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">2.7. Please note that by submitting Reviews regarding the Website, Service and/or Restaurants, you consent to us to use such Reviews on the Website and in any marketing or advertising materials. We will only identify you for this purpose by your first name and the city in which you reside (and any other information that you may from time to time consent to us disclosing).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.1. The information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored on our servers which may be in or outside Australia, and may be accessed by or given to our staff working outside Australia and third parties including companies within the Menulog group of companies (which means our subsidiaries and affiliates, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries and affiliates) who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes notified to you from time to time in this policy. We may disclose your information to overseas recipients, including, without limitation, recipients located in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Bangladesh, Singapore, India, China, the Philippines and the United States of America. Where we disclose your personal information to overseas recipients, we will always take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is treated in accordance with this policy and the Australian Privacy Principles.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.2. The third parties with whom we share your information may undertake various activities such as processing credit card payments and providing support services for us. In addition, we may need to provide your information to any Restaurants that you have placed an Order with so as to allow the Restaurant to process and deliver your Order. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.3. If our business enters into a joint venture with, purchases or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, our new business partners or owners or their advisors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">3.4. We may use the information that you provide to us if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with (and/or where we believe we are under a duty to comply with) any legal obligation; or in order to enforce the Website Terms and any other agreement; or to protect our rights or the rights of Restaurants or other third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and prevention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4. SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.1. We take steps to protect your information from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure and against misuse, interference, loss, destruction and damage. Once your information is no longer required for any purpose for which it may be used or disclosed by us, and we are not required by law to retain the information, we will destroy the information or ensure that it is de-identified.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.2. Where you have registered an account with Menulog and chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone. Unless we negligently disclose your password to a third party, we will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.3. All user details captured by Menulog are stored securely at all times and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties. All credit card details are protected using SSL (</span><span style="color: #797876;">Secure Socket Layer</span><span style="color: #797876;">) encryption. Menulog has been verified for security and compliance to PCI standards by Vectra Corporation, an independent third party. Credit card details are handled by leading PCI compliant providers of secure credit card processing solutions. Menulog will never save your actual credit card details. We will simply save a reference to your card, which is called a token.&nbsp; This token is provided to us by the payment provider. Saving the token means that for future credit card transactions we can give you the option to charge the same card you used previously without having to re-enter the card details. If, at any time, you wish the token to be removed please email us at enquiries@menulog.com and we will have these removed. In that case you would need to re-enter your card details on the next order.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">4.4. However, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take reasonable steps to protect your information and make sure it is safe and secure and we use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk. For the avoidance of doubt, Menulog will not in any circumstances be liable to you, or third parties, for loss or damage arising from credit card fraud or identity theft.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 11pt;"><span style="color: #797876;">5. COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING</span></p>
