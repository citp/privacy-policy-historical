<h1>Why does take away &amp; food delivery ordering through Menulog cost less?</h1>
<p>Menulog does not mark up restaurant prices, nor charge customers any service fees over and above what the restaurant charges. Our customers get a better deal because many of our restaurants offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>•</span> First customer discounts of up to 35%</li>
<li><span>•</span> Loyalty discounts<br>(e.g. Order 7 times, 8th is free)</li>
<li><span>•</span> Plus thousands of other specials</li>
</ul>
<p class="noSpaceBelow">If you order from Menulog and then find the same item under the same terms advertised by the restaurant within 24 hours, we will credit you the price difference plus an additional $5 for that order.</p>

Credit card details are handled by a 3rd party Payment Gateway called Direct Payment Solutions (DPS), a leading PCI Compliant Provider of secure credit card processing solutions. Menulog will never save your actual credit card details. We will simply save a reference to your card, which is called a token.&nbsp; This token is provided to us by our Payment Gateway.&nbsp; Saving the token means that for future credit card transactions we can give you the option to charge the same card you used previously without having to re-enter the card details. You will still need to enter your Menulog password to use this credit card. If, at any time, you wish the token to be removed please email us at enquiries@menulog.com and we will have these removed.&nbsp; In that case you would need to re-enter your card details on the next order.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, Menulog will not in any circumstances be liable to you, or third parties, for loss or damage arising from credit card fraud or identity theft.<br></div>
