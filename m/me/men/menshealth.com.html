<br> 
						<a name="chapter1"><b>Children Under 13:</b></a>
<br> 
						We care about the safety of children. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personal identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as, their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children's on-line experience and to share your interest in our sites with your young ones. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<a name="chapter2"><b>What information do you collect about me?</b></a> 
<br> 
						Rodale collects personal identifying information ("PII") from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us on website(s) and through e-mail. We also collect PII during transactions, sponsored events, mobile marketing campaigns, and contests/sweepstakes. When visiting one of our online sites, we collect user-specific information on what pages are visited and volunteered information such as survey information and/or site registrations. PII includes your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone and cell phone numbers, wireless service provider, and all other information you provide to us. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<b>What's in it for me?</b>
<br> 
						Plenty! The information we collect allows us to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each visitor. Plus, it enables us to notify you about updates to our Website... contact you with special offers of interest... and customize your Website experience. In addition, information is shared with reputable organizations that may contact you with special offers of possible interest. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<b>May I update my account and contact information?</b>
<br> 
						Yes! Upon request, we will update your personal account information (e.g., customer number)... access your account status (outstanding balance)... and update your contact information (i.e., name, address, phone number). You may contact us by completing the form at <a href="http://www.rodale.com/cs/privacy.html">privacy@rodale.com</a> or by calling us at (800) 914-9363. If you prefer, you may write to us at Customer Service, Rodale Inc., 400 South Tenth Street, Emmaus, PA 18098.
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<a name="chapter3"><b>Your Privacy Rights</b></a> 
<br> 
						From time to time, we make your PII available to other reputable businesses whose products or services might be of value to you. If you do not want us to share your PII with other companies or organizations, please let us know by accessing the form at <a href="http://www.rodale.com/cs/privacy.html">privacy@rodale.com</a>, by calling us at (800) 914-9363, or writing to us at Customer Service, Rodale Inc., 400 South Tenth Street, Emmaus, PA 18098. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<b>What if I don't want commercial/promotional e-mail from Rodale?</b> 
<br> 
						Easy. If you do not want to receive commercial/promotional e-mail from Rodale, please let us know by utilizing the unsubscribe option available on e-mail communications, by accessing the form at <a href="http://www.rodale.com/cs/privacy.html">privacy@rodale.com</a>, by calling us at (800) 914-9363, or by writing to us at: Customer Service, Rodale Inc., 400 South Tenth Street, Emmaus, PA 18098.
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<b>Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes</b> 
<br> 
						Rodale Inc. may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in Rodale's business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, customer information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your PII potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said customer information. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						You acknowledge that Rodale is located in the United States of America ("U.S.") and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S.
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<a name="chapter4"><b>Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees</b></a>
<br> 
						Rodale deploys mobile marketing campaigns and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device.  You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device.  Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan prior to registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving text messages or emails to your mobile device at the time you register and with each message or email you receive.
<br> 
						
<br> 
						Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to Rodale or a third-party campaign operator.  An e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile device.  Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, Rodale and the third-party campaign operator collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<a name="chapter5"><b>What are "cookies" and what do they do for me?</b></a> 
<br> 
						In order to provide better service when you return to our site, Rodale may use cookies to store your preferences and information about such things as items added to your shopping cart, purchases you have made with us, what pages you visit, and past activity at a site. "Cookies" are tiny pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are also used to ensure that you are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads and to customize Webpage content based on your browser type (Netscape or Microsoft Explorer, for example). Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						If you want to disable cookies, there is a simple procedure in most Internet browsers that allows you to turn off cookies. Please remember, however, that cookies may be required to allow you to use certain features of our sites. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						We may also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.rodale.com/1,6597,8--921,00.html">click here</a>.
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<b>Links</b> 
<br> 
						Rodale sites may, on occasion, contain links to other sites with information gathering practices different from our own. Visitors should consult privacy policies for all other sites, as Rodale has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						Rodale sites sometimes offer contest, sweepstakes, or promotions sponsored or co-sponsored by third parties. These third parties may obtain PII that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. Rodale has no control over the third-party sponsor's use of this information. The Rodale site will notify you at the time of requesting PII if third-party sponsors will be provided with such information. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<a name="chapter6"><b>Changes...</b></a> 
<br> 
						Rodale may need to change this privacy policy from time to time in order to address new issues, evolving technologies, changes on our sites, or business practices. Rodale will post those changes so you will always know what information we gather and how we might use that information. Please refer back to this policy regularly. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<b>What about data security?</b> 
<br> 
						To ensure the security of your data - including address information and credit card numbers - Rodale always uses industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. We have appropriate security measures that protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you. 
<br> 
						
<br> 
						<a name="chapter7"><b>Rules for Submissions and Messages</b></a> 
<br> 
						Responsibility for what is posted in the discussion groups or other public forums lies with each user - you alone are responsible for the content of your messages and the consequences of any such messages. We cannot and do not review every submission a user may make. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy or propriety of any submission. We do, however, reserve the right but do not assume the obligation to restrict or prohibit your use of our sites if we believe you are violating any of the terms of the agreement and to remove, edit, or relocate any submission as we see fit whether for legal or other reasons. 
<br>
