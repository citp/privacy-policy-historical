  <p align="right"><b>Effective 
Date: 9/1/2006</b> <br></p>
<p><b>Two Bit Operation Privacy 
Notice</b> <br></p>

<p>This website is owned and operated 
by Two Bit Operation.  This privacy notice explains what information 
is collected from those who visit their website, and how that information 
is used, disclosed, and protected.  This notice applies solely 
to information collected from this website. <br></p>
<p><b>What types of information 
are collected from users?</b> <br></p>
<ul><p><b>Personally 
identifiable information:</b>  information that is directly identifiable with 
a specific person, such as name, address, phone number, email address, location, 
screenname, network or online activities. <br></p></ul>

<ul><p>Two Bit Operation will 
not collect information from minors under 13 without parental consent, 
in accordance with the Child Online Privacy Protection Act.</p></ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul><p><b>Aggregate and non-personal 
information:  </b> </p></ul>
<ul><p><b>Cookies:</b>  Like 
many companies, we use "cookies" on our website. Cookies are 
bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you 
visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by 
saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.   <br>

</p></ul>
<ul><p>When you visit our website, 
cookies are placed on your computer. We use cookies to tell us, for 
example, whether you've visited us before or if you're a new visitor 
and to help us identify site features which you may have the greatest 
interest. We collect this information to enhance your experience on 
our website.  We may use cookies in general to collect information 
to determine how to improve our sites by seeing which areas, features, 
and products are most popular; to personalize the site and make recommendations 
based on products you have liked in the past as well as to improve the 
site experience; and to complete transactions you have requested. Advertisers 
that serve ads on our Web sites may also use their own cookies.</p></ul>
<ul><p><b>Javascript:</b>  
Certain pages on our site contain javascript which allows 
third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer 
that downloaded the page on which the javascript appears, 
the URL of the page on which the javascript appears, 
the time the page containing the javascript was viewed, 
the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies 
set by the third party.</p></ul>
<ul><p>Two Bit Operation uses 
third-party advertising companies that utilize javascript 
to collect certain anonymous information about an Internet user's 
visit to our Web site. This allows companies to 
better understand the traffic patterns within their Web sites and recognize 
visitors generated from online and e-mail advertising campaigns. They 
also allow advertisers to understand the response patterns in online 
advertising.</p></ul>
<p><b>How and when is personally 
identifiable information collected?</b> <br></p>
<ul><p>We 
collect information when you sign up, use, or request information about 
our services, or otherwise communicate with Two Bit Operation via Internet or other wireless 
device.  Some information is automatically collected whenever you interact 
with Two Bit Operation's website, such as IP address and the type 
of browser you use.  We may also receive information about you from other 
sources such as credit or marketing information.   <br></p></ul>
<ul><p>In general, we use "personally 
identifiable" information to market and provide services, to anticipate 
and resolve problems with your service, or to create and inform you 
of services that better meet your needs. For example, by understanding 
how you use our Web site, we are able to customize and personalize your 
experience or we may be able to provide information we think will interest 
you or enable you to conduct transactions more easily. <br>

</p></ul>
<p><b>How do we use personally 
identifiable information?</b></p>
<ul><p>We may use the information 
you provide to contact you from time to time. For example, we may (i) 
send you promotional materials and other communications you request, 
(ii) respond to your comments or questions, or (iii) contact you if 
needed while processing a product or service you requested through our 
website. We also may use the information you provide to contact you 
for your opinions on Two Bit Operation products or the website.</p></ul>
<ul><p>We also use personally-identifiable 
information about you to improve our website features and content and 
to analyze website usage. In addition, we use personally-identifiable 
information for market research purposes. We also may use personally-identifiable 
information about you to deliver content that is customized to your 
interests as we understand them from the information you've provided 
to us and your activities on the site.</p></ul>
<ul><p>Your screenname, personal icon, and any reviews or comments you submit will also be 
displayed on your personal profile page, and individual restaurant review 
pages.  If you include personally-identifiable information in your 
screenname, personal icon, reviews or comments, or other information displayed 
on your personal profile page, then you are consenting to allow that 
information to be displayed on the website.</p></ul>
<p><b>How do we share personally 
identifiable information?</b></p>
<ul><p>Two Bit Operation is NOT 
in the business of selling personally identifiable information to others 
and we disclose "personally identifiable" information only 
in the following ways: </p></ul>

<ul><p><b>With your consent:  </b>
We may obtain your consent to disclose personally  identifiable information 
in a number ways, including in writing; verbally; online by clicking 
a button; through the use of a dialing string or button on a wireless 
device or handset; or at the time of initiation or use of any service 
when your consent is part of the required terms and conditions to use 
the service. Sometimes your consent is implicit. For example, if you 
purchase a product through our Web site and request that it be shipped 
to your home, you implicitly consent to our disclosure of your name 
and address to a third-party shipping company to complete delivery and 
your charge card number to the bank to collect payment. </p></ul>
<ul><p><b>Transaction processing:  </b>
We disclose personally identifiable information to third parties as 
necessary to complete a transaction or perform a service in our behalf. 
When the third party acts solely in our behalf, such as a billing service 
vendor, Two Bit Operation will restrict their use and disclosure of 
personally identifiable information. That means that such third party, 
acting solely on our behalf, will not be permitted to disclose "personally 
identifiable" information to another third party without your consent.  <br>
 <br>
Our services may let you 
take advantage of services and products offered by other companies. 
In those cases, information about you received by those third parties 
will be governed by their privacy policies. </p></ul>

<ul><p><b>Business transfers:  </b>
In the event that Two Bit Operation is involved in a merger, acquisition, 
insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personally identifiable customer 
information may be transferred as one of the business assets in the 
transaction.</p></ul>
<ul><p><b>Information released 
in compliance with the law:  </b>
We release personally identifiable and other account information when 
we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful 
subpoena, E-9-1-1 information); to enforce or apply our customer agreements; 
to initiate, render, bill, and collect for services; or to protect our 
rights or property, or to protect users of those services and other 
carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription 
to, such services; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving 
immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires 
disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without 
delay. </p></ul>
<p><b>How do we protect personally 
identifiable information?</b> <br></p>
<ul><p>The security of personally-identifiable 
information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical 
and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, 
alteration or destruction of the personally-identifiable information 
we collect on this website. <br></p></ul>
<p><b>How do 
we share aggregate and non-personal information?</b> <br>

</p>
<ul><p>We sell aggregate and non-personal 
information about customer activity and opinions as a market research 
service to restaurants or any other parties interested in the data.  
The data will be anonymous, so personally identifiable information will 
not be included in that research. <br></p></ul>
<p><b>Updates to this privacy 
notice:  </b> </p>
<ul><p>We may change or update portions of this privacy notice at any time. Please 
review these terms regularly so you are aware of any changes or updates 
to the notice. We will indicate the notice's effective date on the 
first page of the notice. <br></p></ul>
