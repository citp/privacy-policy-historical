# Privacy Policy | Mental Floss

**General**  
Mental Floss, Inc, publisher of mental_floss magazine and other associated mental_floss works, are committed to maintaining appropriate privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using mentalfloss.com. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit mentalfloss.com. We may make content or services from other Web sites including our affiliated or co-branded Web sites available to you from links located on mentalfloss.com. These other Web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such Web site to determine how that site protects your privacy.

**Order Information**  
The information that you give us and information about your order may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. This information may also be shared with our third-party service providers that assist us with our marketing efforts and with other marketers whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at: [pleaseremove@mentalfloss.com](mailto:pleaseremove@mentalfloss.com).

**Email List**  
We do not rent, sell or share our email list. If you do not wish to receive our email anymore, an unsubscribe button is located at the bottom of each email for your convenience. Or you can send us an email with the subject line "Unsubscribe me" to: [unsubscribeme@mentalfloss.com](mailto:unsubscribeme@mentalfloss.com).

**Surveys**  
Our reader survey is entirely voluntary and you may decline to participate by not clicking on the link that says "survey." We're not very tricky that way. The information is not tied to you personally in any way; we only use it for demographic purposes.

**Web Site Usage Information**  
We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you visit our Web site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our Web sites on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each Web page, and the length of their visits. And as for you ... you spend way too much time on the Internet, especially reading small, unimportant stuff such as this. Get a life, will ya?

**Cookies**  
mental_floss uses "cookies" to make your shopping experience more enjoyable. We use them to let us know whether you've been to our site previously and as a way to create content that is more relevant to you. Cookies do not enable us to retrieve from your computer any additional personal information about you other than information that you knowingly have provided to us through the order process.

**Policy Modifications**  
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time on a whim, for our own amusement. We have to have fun somehow.

**Third Party Advertising**  
Mental Floss, Inc. is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

We use third party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit these Services.
