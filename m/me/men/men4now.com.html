                  a "cookie," which is a small file, to your hard drive. 
                  We may use cookies to enhance your online experience, to facilitate 
                  your use of our Web site and to collect anonymous, aggregated 
                  site-visitation statistics which we can use to measure the effectiveness 
                  of, and to improve, not only our Web site but our products and 
                  services. <br>
                  If you register for certain personalized services, or choose 
                  to save personal information on our Web site, such information 
                  may be stored in a cookie. This allows us to greet you by name 
                  the next time you visit our Web site. This also makes your repeated 
                  online interactions with us easier by allowing you to avoid 
                  re-entering your log-in or other information each time you visit 
                  our Web site. <br>
                  The cookies also allow Men4Now to monitor, on an anonymous, 
                  collective basis, information such as:<br>
                  · The Internet service providers that our members and

                  Netscape, that our customers and visitors use. <br>
                  · The Internet Protocol addresses of our customers and 
                  visitors. <br>

                  Tracer, or spotlighting, technologies may also be used by Men4Now 
                  or its service providers. Tracers are tiny, invisible graphics 
                  that tag content to collect anonymous site-visitation statistics 
                  and track the effectiveness of certain marketing campaigns like 
                  banner advertisements and e-mail. We review the collected information 
                  on an anonymous aggregated, or group, basis without any personally 
                  identifiable consumer information. <br>
                  Tracers are used by Men4Now or our service providers to: 
                  <br>
                  · Provide usage measurements for some portions of our 
                  Web site. <br>
                  · Track the number of times our Web site is accessed 
                  from a Men4Now advertisement placed on a third party's 
                  Web site. <br>
                  · Trace a hyperlink to our Web site provided in an e-mail 
                  message distributed by us or on our behalf revealing whether 
                  such visitors subsequently apply online for, are approved for 
                  and/or use a Men4Now product or service. <br>
                  · Monitor the number of our customers who open particular 
                  e-mail messages that they choose to receive. <br>
                  Tracer technology may also be used to determine whether a customer 
                  who has opted to receive informational e-mails from Men4Now 
                  is capable of reading e-mails sent in HTML format. We prefer 
                  to send e-mails in HTML format since it allows customers to 
                  view better graphics and improves the customer experience. The 
                  e-mail address of each customer that is identified as being 
                  capable of reading HTML formatted e-mails is marked "HTML-capable" 
                  and subsequent e-mails are sent to the customer in HTML format. 
                  If an e-mail address is not HTML-capable, subsequent e-mails 
                  are sent in text or AOL format. </font></p>
