By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms. If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any products through the Website.

I. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE AND SALE

1\. INTRODUCTION AND OUR ROLE

1.1. Company details: Menulog Pty Ltd (ACN 120 943 615) is a company registered in New South Wales, Australia at Level 13, 22 Market Street, Sydney NSW, 2000 Australia.

1.2. Service: We provide a way for you to communicate your orders ("Orders") for products ("Products") to delivery or takeaway restaurants ("Restaurants") displayed on the Website (the "Service").

2\. WEBSITE ACCESS AND TERMS

2.1. Website access: You may access some areas of the Website without making an Order or registering your details with us. Most areas of the Website are open to everyone. 

When you use the Website or register an account, you will provide us with personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number, credit or debit card information and address. You must ensure that this information is accurate and current. We will handle all personal information we collect in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.menulog.com.au/menulog_privacy)

If you choose to register an account or when you place your first order, we will provide you with a user name and you will select a password. You are responsible for keeping this user name and password secure and are responsible for all use and activity carried out under this user name.

2.2. Acceptance of terms: By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms. If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any Products through the Website.

2.3. Revision of terms: We may revise these Website Terms at any time. You should check the Website regularly to review the current Website Terms, because they are binding on you. You will be subject to the terms and conditions in force at the time that you place an Order through us.

2.4. Responsibility: You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your Internet connection are aware of these Website Terms and that they comply with them.

3\. YOUR STATUS

3.1. Capacity and age: By placing an Order through the Website, you warrant that:

3.1.1. You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and 

3.1.2. You are at least 18 years old.

3.2. Alcohol and cigarettes: Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that: 

3.2.1. it is an offence for any person under the age of 18 to buy, or attempt to buy, intoxicating liquor, or for any person over the age of 18 to buy intoxicating liquor on behalf of any person under the age of 18;

3.2.2. Cigarettes are not for sale to persons under the age of 18; and

3.2.3. Orders containing either alcohol or cigarettes can therefore not be accepted from or on behalf of persons under the age of 18. In the event that you place an order for alcohol or tobacco products, you will be required by the restaurant to show ID on delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, if your Order includes alcohol or tobacco, the Restaurant is providing you with these and Menulog is not selling alcohol or tobacco to you. Menulog supports the Responsible Service of Alcohol.

4\. HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED

4.1. Compiling your Order: Once you select the Products you wish to order from the menu of your chosen Restaurant and provide other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order by clicking or selecting the "proceed", "place my order", "checkout" or similar button. It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so we will process your Order and errors cannot be corrected.

4.2. Minimum Order Amount: If a Restaurant has a minimum order amount in place, you may not place an order with that Restaurant until the value of your Order exceeds that amount. The minimum order amount must be met after applying any discounts or specials that reduce the total Order amount. 

4.3. Amending or cancelling your Order: Once you submit your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order online (please refer to paragraph 4.4 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders). If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you may contact the Restaurant directly or our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started to process your Order.

4.4. Payment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed by or communicated to the relevant Restaurant.

4.5. Processing your Order and Restaurant rejections: On receipt of your Order, we will begin processing it by sending it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed. Any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each merely indicate that your Order has been received and is being processed by us, and does not necessarily mean that your Order has been accepted by the Restaurant. Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order.  When a Restaurant confirms receipt of the order and expected collection or delivery time, we will send you an SMS confirmation (provided that you have given us your mobile telephone number).

4.6. Delivery of your Order: Estimated times for deliveries and collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates. Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for collection within the estimated times. All food preparation and deliveries are the sole responsibility of the Restaurant accepting the Order. To the extent permitted by law, including the Australian Consumer Law, Menulog accepts no liability associated with food preparation or delivery by the Restaurant accepting the order.

5\. PRICE AND PAYMENT

5.1. Taxes and delivery costs: Prices for individual menu items will be as quoted on the Website in Australian dollars. These prices include any applicable taxes but may exclude delivery costs (if you opt for delivery instead of collection) and any online payment administration charge imposed by the Restaurant (if you pay for your Order online). These will be added to the total amount due where applicable.

5.2. Incorrect pricing: This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices. The products will be sold for the displayed price even if the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website.

5.3. Payment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the Restaurant at the point of delivery to you. 

5.4. Card payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card conforms with the receipt data for the Order. Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in delays in sums being deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.

5.5. Credit and discount vouchers: A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by Menulog, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit card. Please refer to our Voucher Terms & Conditions for the full terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers.

5.6. Rejected Orders: Once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, you will be charged the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will refund the relevant amount. However, this may take between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.

6\. CUSTOMER CARE

6.1. General: Customer care is extremely important to us. Subject to paragraphs 6.5 and 11, our Customer Care team will therefore try to assist you where possible if you have any problems with your Order. You can contact our Customer Care team by emailing us or by calling the telephone number shown under the "About us" link on the Website. Alternatively, you can access the list of frequently asked questions [FAQ](https://www.menulog.com.au/faq)

6.2. Questions about your Order: If your Order is taking longer than expected or you have any other problems with your Order, in the first instance you should contact the Restaurant directly. Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to follow up on your query.

6.3. Changing or cancelling your Order: If you wish to change or cancel your Order after it has been submitted and payment has been authorised, you may contact our Customer Care team as described above and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started to process your Order.

6.4. Complaints or feedback: In the event that you would like to express your opinion on the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant, please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings, comments and reviews on the Website (together, "Reviews"). The Reviews are an important part of our quality control process. 

6.5. Compensation: If you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant and wish to seek a refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, you should contact the Restaurant directly to lodge your complaint and, where appropriate, follow the Restaurant's own complaint procedures. If you are unable to contact the Restaurant, or the Restaurant refuses to deal with your complaint, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above within 48 hours of placing your Order and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to request compensation on your behalf. Please note that we have no control over Restaurants and the quality of the individual Products or service that they provide, and we not able to provide, and have no responsibility or liability for providing, any compensation to you on behalf of any Restaurant.

6.6 Healthy+: “Healthy+” accreditation is granted to menu items that use only healthy ingredients. Healthy+ menu items is based on information about those menu items supplied by Menulog partner restaurants. While every effort is made to ensure that menu items displaying the Healthy+ icon comply with the guidelines created by Dr Joanna McMillan in conjunction with Menulog, to the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, any liability or responsibility for the accuracy of information supplied by the partner restaurants is hereby excluded.

4.2. Where you have registered an account with Menulog and chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone. Unless we negligently disclose your password to a third party, we will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password.

Credit card details are handled by leading PCI compliant providers of secure credit card processing solutions. Menulog will never save your actual credit card details. We will simply save a reference to your card, which is called a token.  This token is provided to us by the payment provider. Saving the token means that for future credit card transactions we can give you the option to charge the same card you used previously without having to re-enter the card details. If, at any time, you wish the token to be removed please email us at enquiries@menulog.com and we will have these removed. In that case you would need to re-enter your card details on the next order.

Although we will take reasonable steps to protect your information and make sure it is safe and secure and we use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk.
