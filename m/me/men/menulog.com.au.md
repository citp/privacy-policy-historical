**The information we collect**  
When you lodge a booking and/or place a takeaway order via the Menulog web site, we need to collect information about you in order to enable us to deliver our service. This information includes, but is not limited to, details such as your name, your contact details, your delivery address, your requirements and relevant booking information. 

**How we use the information**  
If you decide to complete an on-line form, the information that you enter into the on-line form will be collected and saved by us. The information you supply to us is used to assess your requirements and to enable the relevant restaurant or takeaway delivery partner to contact you in response to your enquiry. 

We may disclose your information to various third parties for the following purposes: 

  * to send you marketing material for goods or services we think might interest you (whether or not related to your application) 
  * for administration purposes 
  * for such other purposes as we shall in our discretion determine, including for our commercial advantage 



It is a condition of your use of the Menulog website that you agree to allow your data to be disclosed to these third parties and for them to establish contact with you.

As a user of our service, you may occasionally receive email or SMS updates from us about new products or services being offered by Menulog, along with newsletters and any noteworthy changes to the website. You may always unsubscribe and opt out from receiving these messages. 

Unless otherwise prohibited by law or our contractual obligations, we may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. Such situations may include: to perform, maintain or enforce contracts with our users or suppliers; to protect the rights or properties of Menulog, our business affiliates, our users, or others; or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing, or who may be threatening to cause, interference with or damage to our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise; or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. 

Like most web sites, there is certain information we automatically track, including the URL that you just came from, the browser you are using and your IP address. This data is utilised to improve the services of Menulog and does not include any personally identifying information.
