**Privacy Policy**

* * *

Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the highest importance to _Men's News Daily™_ . Unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide will not be known to any other party except you and _Men's News Daily™_. 

_Men's News Daily_ ™ _is a rapidly growing online news source. As such, this policy will change from time to time along with our site._

**Traffic Data**   
Each time a visitor comes to the _Men's News Daily™_ website, our software collects some basic technical information, including the visitor's domain name, referral data and browser and platform type. However, we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data to any party. 

If and when we do present aggregated information on our traffic data to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you. 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a very limited manner, primarily to help deliver advertisements so that you won't receive the same advertisement too many times. We use cookies to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track site navigation. 

Other sites which place advertisements on our site, or which we may provide a link referencing an article that is available to view on _Men's News Daily™_ , also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that Men's News Daily™ does not control. 

Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. So these advertisers will not know who a visitor is, nor will they have any personally identifiable information about a visitor. 

**Third Party Cookies**  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.
