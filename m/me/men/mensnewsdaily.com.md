# BlogWonks: Your Alternate Daily » Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

Java King, Inc. is the owner of various domains, including MensNewsDaily.com, MNDnet.com, blogwonks.com, and others.

Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the highest importance to _Java King, Inc._ (hereinafter JKI), the owner of this domain.. Unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide will not be known to any other party except you and _JKI_.

**Traffic Data**  
Each time a visitor comes to a _JKI_ website, our software collects some basic technical information, including the visitor’s domain name, referral data and browser and platform type. However, we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data to any party.

If and when we do present aggregated information on our traffic data to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies in a very limited manner, primarily to help deliver advertisements so that you won’t receive the same advertisement too many times. We use cookies to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track site navigation.

Other sites which place advertisements on our site, or which we may provide a link referencing an article that is available to view on MensNewsDaily.com or BlogWonks.com, also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that JKI does not control.

Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. So these advertisers will not know who a visitor is, nor will they have any personally identifiable information about a visitor.

**Third Party Cookies**  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.

**Third Party Advertising**  
We use MaxWorldwide and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

**Other sites**  
_JKI_ webistes contain many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these linked sites, because their privacy practices may differ from ours.

**Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?**  
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, contact editor(at)MensNewsDaily.com.
