Men's Wearhouse is committed to protecting your privacy while visiting or using this Site. This privacy policy will help you understand what information is collected when you visit menswearhouse.com and how that information will be used. If we adjust this policy in the future, we will post those changes here. Since this policy, as it may be changed, applies to you, you should review this policy from time to time.

If you choose to register with us, we will keep this information stored on a secure server, and your default credit card information will be encrypted.

 **Shopping Online**

When you visit our Site and shop online with Men's Wearhouse, we will ask you to submit certain information in order to properly process your order, such as your name, phone number, billing and shipping addresses, credit card information, and e-mail address. If necessary, we will contact you via telephone or e-mail to request any information needed to fulfill and ship your merchandise. This information too will be stored on a secure server, and credit card information will be encrypted. Additionally, we may contact you after your order has shipped to ensure that your order was received in good condition and in a timely manner.

 **Cookies and Web Beacons**

A cookie is a small file that our web server will store on your computer to give you an individual ID. We use cookies to allow us to understand what areas of our Web site are of interest to you so we can better serve you. For example, by allowing our site to place a cookie on your computer, you will be able to retrieve your shopping cart during a future visit. In this case, a cookie will store useful information, including some personal information, which enables our web site to remember you when you return to visit. In these cases, only Men's Wearhouse can read that information.

Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a web page. Web beacons are most often used in conjunction with cookies to monitor activity on our web site. We use web beacons to track how our customers use our site, as well as track the success of various marketing efforts. The information, once processed by our vendors, helps us focus our resources on the features that are most popular with our users. We use the information only at the aggregate, not individual, level. In other words, the information we use is not personally identifiable.

If you do not wish to have a cookie on your system, you may be able to set your browser to either refuse cookies in the future or warn you before accepting a cookie. For further information, please refer to the documentation and help system provided with your browser software. In addition, browsers may allow you to delete any cookies they have accumulated during your past Internet excursions. Please note that if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some parts of our site may not work properly.

 **Sharing Information**

At Men's Wearhouse we are committed to protecting our relationship with our customers. That's why we never trade, sell, or otherwise disseminate any personal information about our customers, except as part of our own business (including through joint marketing agreements with third parties) or that of an affiliate or subsidiary. From time to time we share aggregated and personally identifiable information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and companies with which we have joint marketing arrangements, to assist in our or their marketing and merchandising efforts. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires such disclosure, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and as necessary to protect the property, interests, and rights of Men's Wearhouse, its affiliates, subsidiaries, and others.

At times we may contract with unaffiliated third parties to assist us in managing and maintaining our customer information. At no time will we authorize those parties to use your information for any other purpose. Additionally, we may rent or sell to third parties aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site. Except as set forth in this policy, at no time will we disseminate personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties for any reason. If this changes, we will contact you via the most recent e-mail address you have provided to us. At that time, you will have the opportunity to remove your information from our database.

Except as described above, we will not share, rent or sell any information with any other party for any reason.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.

Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.

 **What is aggregated non-personal information?**

"Aggregate non-personal information" is information that is recorded about users and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.

 **Other Communications You May Receive**

Men's Wearhouse generally sends the following mailings each year:

  * Invitations to our one or more Customer Appreciation Days
  * Invitations to our Seasonal or other Annual/Semi-Annual Sales



We may also make other promotional information available to you through e-mail. However, if you do not want to receive e-mail communications, please check the appropriate box during the registration process or contact us. See "For Further Information" below for contact information.

 **Men's Wearhouse Discussion Boards**

We provide access to Discussion Boards on our Site as a convenience to our customers. Please remember that any information disclosed in this area is available to the public. The dissemination of any personal information you provide in this area is beyond our control and you should therefore exercise caution before disclosing any personal information.

 **Children's Policy**

Men's Wearhouse is very concerned about the safety of children using the Internet. In keeping with the Children's Online Protection Act of 1998, we will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any visitor under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

If we discover that a visitor under the age of 13 has registered without parental consent, we will remove his or her registration information from our files. We may then maintain a record of the child's name and address in a DO NOT REGISTER file to prevent future re-registration by them.

 **Links to Other Sites and Services**

This Site may include links to other sites that are not within our control. These websites have their own policies about privacy and security, which you should review before using those sites. Men's Wearhouse does not assume any responsibility for these linked sites and provides these links solely for the convenience of our customers.
