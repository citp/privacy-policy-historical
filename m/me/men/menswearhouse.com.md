# Privacy and Security Policy| Men's Wearhouse

Effective February 14, 2014

##  Your Privacy Rights

The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. (“Men’s Wearhouse”, “us”, “our”, or “we”) is committed to protecting your privacy when you (a) visit the MensWearhouse.com website (“Site”), (b) download a Men’s Wearhouse mobile application (“App”), (c) shop at our stores, or (d) join any of our marketing campaigns, whether via SMS or otherwise. This privacy policy will help you understand what information is collected when you visit our Site, App, or our stores, or join our marketing campaigns, and how that information will be used. If we adjust this policy in the future, we will post those changes here. Since this policy applies to you, you should review this policy from time to time as it may be changed.

**Aggregate Non-Personal Information That We Collect**

"Aggregate non-personal information" is information that is recorded about users and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user. Some examples of this are geographic location or anonymous site usage data.

**Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect**

When you register for services or purchase products from Men’s Wearhouse, the following personally identifiable information may be collected:

  * Name
  * Mailing / Shipping Address
  * Phone Number
  * E-Mail Address
  * Birth Date and/or Year of Birth
  * Year of Graduation from High School
  * Credit Card Information
  * Order information
  * Geographic location
  * Personal information volunteered by visitors during registration / purchase.



For example, when you visit our Site and shop online with Men's Wearhouse, we will ask you to submit certain information identified above in order to properly process your order. If necessary, we will contact you via telephone or e-mail to request any information needed to fulfill and ship your merchandise or to advise you of any delays to the shipment anticipated. Additionally, we may contact you after your order has shipped to ensure that your order was received in good condition and in a timely manner. In all events, we will keep the information you submit on a secure server and, your credit card information will be encrypted. You may view, change, or delete your personal information at any time by contacting us by email, mail or phone. See "For Further Information," below for contact information. Please note that if you are signing up for the Perfect Fit® Credit Card, then you are submitting and sharing your information with GE Capital Retail Bank ("GECRB"), and the [privacy policy of GECRB](https://chb.onlinecreditcenter6.com/consumereApply/Internet/menswear/en/pdf/PrivacyPolicy.pdf) applies.

We also automatically receive and record information from the browser or operating system you use on your mobile device or computer, such as your IP address, UUID, Internet connection speed and duration, device type, geographic data, browser type, device type, operating system, date and time information.

**Sharing Information**

At Men's Wearhouse, we are committed to protecting our relationship with our customers, and we use personally identifiable information that you submitted as part of our own business (including through joint marketing agreements with third parties) or that of an affiliate or subsidiary. Specifically, from time to time we share aggregate non-personal and personally identifiable information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and companies with which we have joint marketing arrangements, to assist in our or their marketing and merchandising efforts. We also may share with third parties aggregate non-personal information about visitors to the Site or App without restriction as to use.

We also may disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties to (a) assist us in managing, storing, and maintaining customer information, (b) assist us in our own marketing efforts; or (c) administer services on our behalf, such as credit card processing for purchases. In these situations, we do not authorize those parties to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information or aggregate non-personal information when (a) we believe the law requires such disclosure, (b) in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and (c) as necessary to protect the property, interests, and rights of Men's Wearhouse, its affiliates, subsidiaries, and others. Finally, in the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by Men’s Wearhouse, or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, both personally identifiable information and aggregate non-personal information from and/or about our customers may be among the transferred assets.

Please contact us for any questions about the management or use of personally identifiable information or if you do not wish to have your personally identifiable information shared. See "For Further Information," below for contact information.

**How do we collect your information?**

We collect information you supply to us. In addition, we use cookies, which are small data files (“Cookie”) that our web server, emails, or third party providers (through our Site/App and our behalf), store on your computer. The Cookies give you an individual ID and enable you to shop on our Site and may be used to enhance or personalize your online browsing and shopping experience. For example, by allowing our Site/App to place a Cookie on your computer/mobile device, you will be able to retrieve your shopping cart during a future visit. If you do not wish to have a Cookie on your system, you may be able to set your browser to either refuse them in the future, or to warn you before accepting Cookies. For further information, please refer to the documentation and help system provided with your browser software. In addition, browsers may allow you to delete any cookies they have accumulated during your past Internet excursions. Please note that if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some parts of our Site/App may not work properly, and you may need to opt-out again if your opt-out was stored using cookies.

We also use other technologies, such as pixel tags or web beacons (collectively “Other Technologies”). These Other Technologies are small images that we embed on our pages and emails that transmit data (through our Site/App and our behalf). These Other Technologies help us analyze our customers’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising, and better serve you. For example, the Other Technologies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with specific messages, such as notifying us that you received, opened, or clicked a link in an email message from us. We may also gather and learn how much revenue was generated by a specific campaign using the Other Technology. We also work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. Men’s Wearhouse does recognize tracking signals. To learn more about this practice, please click the AdChoice® icon on our banner advertisements or visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). To opt-out, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

**Information Security and Notification**

For your online transactions, we use Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology, third party software to control the use of digital certificates which support up to 256-bit encryption, designed to secure your online ordering process. Web browsers, like Internet Explorer and Mozilla, generally provide clear visual indicators that tell you whether or not you are browsing in secure mode. The first indication is in the Website address itself. In standard (or non-secure) mode, the address will begin with "http://". When you enter a secure site, the address will begin with "https://". In this address prefix, the "s" means "secure". Additional browsers typically display a lock icon in a lower corner of the browser window or right next to the address bar to indicate secured browsing. If your Internet browser does not use a cipher strength of 128-bits or better, but you wish to use it, you may usually download a free upgrade from your browser vendor. Click on the third party logo at the bottom left hand corner of our website at www.menswearhouse.com to find out more about the third party software we use.

Once we obtain your information, we maintain it on secured servers, including Cloud servers, and we encrypt your credit card information. But, there is no perfect security that is impenetrable from hackers and thieves. In the very unlikely event we believe that the security of your information in the possession or control of Men’s Wearhouse may have been compromised and if notification is appropriate, Men’s Wearhouse may notify you using the information you submitted to Men’s Wearhouse.

**Other Communications You May Receive**

Men's Wearhouse generally sends mailings periodically informing you of our sales and special promotions. We may also make other information available to you through e-mail. However, if you do not want to receive e-mail communications, please check the appropriate box during the registration process or contact us. See "For Further Information" below for contact information.

**Men's Wearhouse Ratings and Reviews or Social Media Sites**

As a convenience to our customers, Men’s Wearhouse provides access to Ratings and Reviews on our Site. Men’s Wearhouse also has profiles on social networking sites. Please remember that any information disclosed in this area is available to the public. The dissemination of any personal information you provide in this area is beyond our control and you should therefore exercise caution before disclosing any personal information.

**Children's Policy**

Men's Wearhouse is very concerned about the safety of children using the Internet. In keeping with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any visitor under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

If we discover that a visitor under the age of 13 has registered without parental consent, we will remove his or her registration information from our files. We may then maintain a record of the child's name and address in a DO NOT REGISTER file to prevent future re-registration by them.

**Links to Other Sites and Services**

This Site may include links to other sites that are not within our control. These websites have their own policies about privacy and security, which you should review before using those sites. Because we link to social media sites or other sites, other parties may collect your personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different web sites when you visit this Site. Men's Wearhouse does not assume any responsibility for these linked sites and provides these links solely for the convenience of our customers.
