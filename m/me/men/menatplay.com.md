Pretty much every site nowadays uses them for such basic necessities as "user sessions" (i.e. knowing and remembering if you are logged in or not).

We use standard 'session identification' cookies created by our content management system. These cookies are used to distinguish you from other users.

Menatplay uses Google Analytics to measure and analyze what people do on our site. This is the gold standard of online analytics tools and we use it to look at things like which pages are most popular (and which ones aren't), which browsers people use, how they arrive at our site, etc. - all of which allows us to keep improving the site and your experience.

These are all standard uses of cookies and we do not record any more information than needed or do anything out of the norm. 

Members are not obligated to accept cookies and browsers can be modified to refuse cookies. Users may also delete cookies. If all cookies are refused, many websites may not function properly, including Ours. It is possible to modify browser settings to only accept cookies with consent before each cookie is placed on the computer or device used. This provides more control over what is placed on the computer or device, however, it may slow down the web experience.

If you wish to restrict, block or delete cookies, you can do this through your web browser. Instructions for how to manage cookies for all versions of all of the major web browsers: Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc. can be found online with a standard search.
