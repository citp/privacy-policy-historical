The information we collect from our customers is solely to process their orders and is used to better serve and provide our customers relevant information, such order confirmation, order status updates, and to provide the customer with information on products or services that are available from us or affiliates associated with us.

We require customers to provide a username (please use your email address) and a password of their choice to allow future access to account information. To protect and safeguard your username and password and to ensure it remains confidential, please do not share this information with anyone.

If you elect to receive our promotional materials, surveys, and newsletters, we will use the contact information you have provided to deliver this information to you.

Examples of such communications would be: changes to policies; changes to our methods of conducting business; a request for you to review and update information we have on file for you; or information regarding any previous transactions with us.

We may have aggregated and gathered information on customers from third-party sources, such as marketing databases made available for commercial purchase.
