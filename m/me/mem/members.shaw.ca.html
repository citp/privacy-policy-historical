Unless such new use is required or permitted by law, in accordance with PIPEDA, the consent of the Customer, Employee or Web Site User is required before the Personal Information can be used for that new purpose.</p><p><br><strong>Use of Cookies</strong>: During a Web Site User’s interaction with one of Shaw's websites, Shaw may use a browser feature called a "cookie" to collect information anonymously and track user patterns on Shaw's websites. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies a Web Site User’s browser – but not the Web Site User personally – to Shaw's computers each time a Web Site User visits one of the Shaw websites using cookies. Cookies tell Shaw which pages of its websites are visited and how many people visited each web page. This helps Shaw to enhance the on-line experience of visitors to the Shaw websites. Cookies also serve to identify your computer so that your preferences can be saved for future visits, and Shaw works with third parties that use these cookies to help us with such traffic management, research and analytics.</p><p><br>The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major browsers are initially set up to accept them. You can reset your browser to either refuse to accept all cookies or to notify you when you have received a cookie. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on Shaw's websites.</p><p><br><strong>Third Party Cookies and Advertisements</strong>: Some of the advertisements you see on the Shaw websites are delivered by third party advertisers, Internet advertising companies that work on Shaw's behalf or ad networks. These third parties may use cookies or other technology to help deliver ads that are tailored to your interests and track their performance. This is commonly known as "behavioural" or "interest-based advertising". <br><br>You can opt-out of several third party ad servers' and networks' cookies simultaneously using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative located at  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.
<br><br><strong>Collection and Use of Television Set-Top Box Data:</strong>  Certain digital set-top boxes used by Customers who subscribe for cable television services, and the FREERANGE TV mobile app, automatically collect raw household tuning data (the "Tuning Data"). Tuning Data is used for billing purposes, diagnostic purposes, for the tuning of recommendation engines and to measure television viewership. Shaw creates a database of anonymized and aggregated viewing behaviour by pairing Tuning Data with non-sensitive information in Customer files. This helps Shaw understand Customer reactions to television content and advertising. The collection of Tuning Data is critical to operating our cable television services and cannot be disabled. However, you can choose to opt-out of Shaw's use of Tuning Data in an anonymized and aggregated database by using the process described in Subsection 3.3 below. You can also disable the delivery of  recommendations via your set-top-box settings. 
<br><br><strong>Shaw Go WiFi:</strong>  In order to access Shaw Go WiFi, you will be requested to provide your Shaw userid, password and certain other information that may be requested from time to time. Shaw will also automatically collect certain information such as device location, device type, and general usage information associated to the Media Access Control (“MAC”) address associated with your device (the “Device Information”). The Device Information is used to deliver the Shaw Go Wifi service, monitor and improve network traffic, improve your Shaw Go WiFi experience and for research and statistical purposes. Shaw may from time to time use the Device Information to deliver advertising to the browser you are using to access the Internet as outlined is our Terms of Use for Shaw Go WiFi. In certain instances, Shaw will rely on a third party to deliver Shaw Go WiFi services at a specified location (for example, certain airports, universities or other public buildings). The relationship with the third party is governed by strict privacy provisions, in compliance with PIPEDA. As part of the delivery of the Shaw Go WiFi services, the third party may have access to the Device Information, which can only be used for limited network monitoring and improvement purposes. </p></div>

	                        <div class="answer"><p>Consent is generally required for the collection of Personal Information and the subsequent use or disclosure of the Personal Information. Consent can be either express or implied. The form of consent sought by Shaw may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of Personal Information. In determining the form of consent to use, Shaw takes into account the sensitivity of the information and your reasonable expectation, so that you understand the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use and/or disclosure of Personal Information. Shaw generally seeks express consent when the Personal Information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent is typically appropriate when the Personal Information is less sensitive.
<br>
Business Contact Information can be used by Shaw without consent solely for the purpose of facilitating communication between Shaw and an employee, in relation to his/her employment, business or profession. 
<br>
In addition, in exceptional circumstances, as permitted by law, Shaw may collect, use and/or disclose Personal Information without a Customer’s, Employee’s or Web Site User's knowledge or consent.

Customers who do not check the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of their information to third parties;</li><li>orally when information is collected over the telephone; or</li><li>at the time a Customer uses a product or service. </li></ol><p></p><p>In general, the use of products and services by a Customer, or a Web Site User's use of a Shaw website, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an Employee, will constitute implied consent required by Shaw to collect, use and/or disclose Personal Information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>Consent may be withdrawn by Customers, Employees and Web Site Users at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and upon providing Shaw reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent to certain collection, retention, use or disclosure of Personal Information, please contact Shaw at <a accesskey="P" href="mailto:privacy@shaw.ca">privacy@shaw.ca</a>. Please note that if you refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with a particular product or service.
