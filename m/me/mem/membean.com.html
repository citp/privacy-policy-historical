<h3 class="text-primary">Personal Information of Children</h3>
<p>
Membean complies with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC's Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").
</p>
<p>
If you are located in the United States and are under the age of thirteen (13) you must have your parent's or legal guardian's approval prior to posting any content on the Website. This is either obtained through your school or school district administrator or directly from your parents or legal guardian.
</p>
<p>
If you are located outside the United States and are under the age of sixteen (16), depending on your location, you may need to obtain your parent's or legal guardian's approval prior to posting any content on the Website or otherwise using the Services.
</p>
<p>
Membean collects limited personal information from students, including the Student Information described above ("Children's Personal Information"), but only where that student's school, school district, parent and/or legal guardian has contracted with Membean to collect Children's Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. Membean requires schools and school districts to obtain consent from students' parents and/or legal guardians before collecting any such Children's Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
If you are a student, please do not send any Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for Membean Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained, or if we learn a student has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for Membean Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
If you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for Membean Services, or that parental consent has not obtained, please contact us.
</p>
</li>
<li class="primary">
<h3 class="text-primary">Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>
Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using our Website and to allow us to provide Services to you. We retain your personal data for a limited time and only to the extent necessary for making the Services available to you. Membean will never give your information to, or share your information with, any third party except as detailed below.
</p>
<p>
Membean will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:
</p><ul>
<li>We have your consent, including, if you are under 13 (or 16, if applicable), the consent of your parent or legal guardian, to share the information;</li>
<li>We need to share your information to provide the Services you have requested;</li>
<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Membean to provide a Service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); or</li>
<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or find that your actions violate the Membean Terms of Service or any of our usage guidelines for specific Services.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>
<li class="primary">
<h3 class="text-primary">Legal Basis for Processing Information</h3>
<p>
If you are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), we will collect and process personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal information to perform a contract with you, or (c) where your organization has provided your personal information to facilitate the performance of a contract with your organization. Membean will not be able to provide the Service to you or our organization if you or your organization do not provide the requested information.
</p>
</li>
<li class="primary">
<h3 class="text-primary">International Information Transfers</h3>
<p>
Membean is a U.S.-based company, providing Services globally. We store your information in the United States. If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), we may transfer your information to the United States in order to provide you the  Services. If you are accessing or using our Website or Services or otherwise providing information to us, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service and the transfer of your personal information to the United States. If you are located in the EEA, to the extent Membean is deemed to transfer your information to the United States, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:
</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>EU Model Clauses:</strong>
The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses, or model clauses ("EU Model Clauses"), which provide safeguards for personal information transferred outside the EEA. We incorporate the EU Model Clauses into our Terms of Service, if applicable. You may request a copy of the EU Model Clauses by contacting us.
</li>
<li>
<strong>EU-US Privacy Shield Framework:</strong>
The privacy shield program ("Privacy Shield") provides companies a mechanism with which to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal information from the EEA to the United States. Membean is in the process of obtaining Privacy Shield certification at this time, which means Membean shall comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the EEA. For more information, see Membean's
<a href="/gdpr/privacyshield">Privacy Shield Policy</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>
<li class="primary">
<h3 class="text-primary">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Service Providers:</strong>
We engage other companies to help us perform functions and provide services ("Service Providers"). For example, Service Providers help us host Website content, operate our Services, monitor our performance, provide customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact our customers, follow up on sales leads and enquiries and otherwise improve our Services. These Service Providers may only process personal information subject to our instructions and in compliance with this Policy, as well as obligations consistent with applicable confidentiality and security measures and regulations, including the GDPR.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Business Transitions:</strong>
We may share your information in the event that Membean goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, as our customers' personal information may be part of the assets transferred. Customers will be notified via prominent notice on our Website prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If, as a result of the business transaction, your personally identifiable information will be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given a choice consistent with our Notification of Changes section.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Required by Law:</strong>
We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we have good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with current judicial proceedings, a court order or legal process served on us, (b) protect and defend our rights, or (c) protect the rights, property, and other interests of our users or others.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>
<li class="primary">
<h3 class="text-primary">Access to Children's Personal Information</h3>

<h3 class="text-primary">Security</h3>
<p>
Wherever your personal information may be held within Membean or on its behalf, we intend to take commercially reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

Finally, we also make an effort to protect your information off-line.
</p>
<p>
When registering for access to a secure area of the Website, we may ask you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the registered Website and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence when accessing your computer.

<p>
If your personally identifiable information changes, you may contact us to correct, update or delete and deactivate our record of your personally identifiable information.

You may send us any subject access requests ("SAR") to

</p>
</li>
<li class="primary">
