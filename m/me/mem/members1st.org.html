        <font color="#0066CC"><b>Member Privacy Is Important To Us</b></font><br>
        At Members 1st FCU, we are committed to providing members with the finest 
        products backed by consistent top-quality service. And while information 
        is fundamental to our ability to do this, we fully recognize the importance 
        of keeping members' personal and account information secure.<br>
        <br>
        <b><font color="#0066CC">Our Commitment to Security</font></b><br>
        Members 1st recognizes how important it is that sensitive information 
        about our members remains confidential. We go to great lengths to safeguard 
        the personal financial information they entrust to us.<br>
        <br>
        We protect member information from unauthorized access, using established 
        and thorough security standards, to ensure that account information remains 
        secure.<br>
        <br>
        We actively seek to verify the identity of our members through the use 
        of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or other information before 
        assisting them.<br>
        <br>
        We are vigilant in the use of fraud protection measures (including keeping 
        members' PINs, social security and/or Tax ID numbers in the strictest 
        of confidence) in order to protect our members' privacy.<br>
        <br>
        We permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling 
        of member information, to have access to that information. Employees who 
        violate our confidentiality policies are subject to strict disciplinary 
        action.<br>
        <b><font color="#0066CC"><br>
        The Information We Collect</font></b><br>
        We collect and use member information obtained from applications and account 
        usage, as well as information derived from other sources. This information 
        is used only to the extent needed to conduct our business and to meet 
        our high quality service standards. We only obtain information in accordance 
        with applicable laws and in response to a member's request for any legitimate 
        business purpose(s).<br>
        <br>
        We make every effort to keep member information files complete, up-to-date, 
        and accurate. We regularly tell our members how and where to access their 
        account information to verify its accuracy. When notified of an error, 
        we promptly make the appropriate correction(s).<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#0066CC"><b>The Information We Share</b></font><br>
        We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers 
        or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. <br>
