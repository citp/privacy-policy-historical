# Members 1st Federal Credit Union - Privacy Statement

March 2002

Because information is an important part of our business, we understand the importance of the personal information you entrust to us. 

The following is the privacy statement of Members 1st Federal Credit Union and its affiliated companies that service or have contact with individual members. **

Member Privacy Is Important To Us

** At Members 1st FCU, we are committed to providing members with the finest products backed by consistent top-quality service. And while information is fundamental to our ability to do this, we fully recognize the importance of keeping members' personal and account information secure.

**Our Commitment to Security**  
Members 1st recognizes how important it is that sensitive information about our members remains confidential. We go to great lengths to safeguard the personal financial information they entrust to us.

We protect member information from unauthorized access, by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your non-public personal information. We actively seek to verify the identity of our members through the use of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or other information before assisting them.

We are vigilant in the use of fraud protection measures (including keeping members' PINs, social security and/or Tax ID numbers in the strictest of confidence) in order to protect our members' privacy.

We permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of member information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our confidentiality policies are subject to strict disciplinary action.  
**  
The Information We Collect**  
We collect and use member information obtained from applications and account usage, as well as information derived from other sources. This information is used only to the extent needed to conduct our business and to meet our high quality service standards. We only obtain information in accordance with applicable laws and in response to a member's request for any legitimate business purpose(s).

We make every effort to keep member information files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We regularly tell our members how and where to access their account information to verify its accuracy. When notified of an error, we promptly make the appropriate correction(s).

  
**The Information We Share**  
We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. 

**We Respect Members' Personal Privacy**  
Even though **Members 1st Federal Credit Union does not share non-public personal information with non-affiliated companies,** we are providing you with the ability to request that you do not receive certain advertising. Presently, members may receive valuable product and service offers from us and/or our well-established affiliates. We carefully develop these offers to meet our standards and to assure that they reach members most likely to take advantage of the opportunity. To do so, we gather information that may indicate financing and investing preferences to create marketing lists.

At any time, members can contact us to remove their names from these direct marketing, telemarketing and email marketing lists. Members can mail requests for a non-solicitation form to: 

Members 1st FCU  
Attention: TeleBranch  
P.O. Box 40  
Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 
Or email us at [accountinquiries@members1st.org](mailto:accountinquiries@members1st.org) and include their full name, address, and account number.
