Memocast uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Memocast Portal. By using these cookies, we can “remember” what you’ve done on the Memocast Portal before and this lets us personalize our site for you and save certain parts of the site or services just the way you like them. These persistent type of cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different, so please look through your browser “Help” file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up.
  * **“Automatically Collected” Information** : When you visit the Memocast Portal or open one of our HTML emails, we automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons”. This “automatically collected” information may include your Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), web browser type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Memocast Portal, the pages you view on our site, and the dates and times that you visit.

**4.** ** _Your Choices_**

You may, of course, decline to share personal information with Memocast, in which case Memocast will not be able to provide certain services to you on the Memocast Portal. You may update, correct, or delete your member information and email subscription preferences at any time by going to the [log-in section](https://web.archive.org/web/20080616022302id_/http%3A//www.memocast.com/login.aspx) of the Memocast Portal. 

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting Customer’s member profile access or before making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. 

**5.** ** _Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites_**

Memocast allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Memocast Portal. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Memocast Portal. They automatically receive your IP Address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. 

Memocast does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Memocast to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-24) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed or purchased certain channels or videos) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Memocast’s Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. 

**6.** ** _Our Commitment to Data Security_ __**

Memocast uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Memocast and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Memocast makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If Memocast learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Memocast may post a notice on the Memocast Portal if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us via the following link [info@memocast.com](mailto:info@memocast.com).

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Memocast does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or automatically collected information from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE MEMOCAST PORTAL AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.
