**Privacy Policy**

Memeo takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

This policy covers how Memeo treats personal information that Memeo collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Memeo does not own or control, or to people that Memeo does not employ or manage. 

The following section explains Memeo’s information practices, including information it collects from you, how Memeo will use the information, and the choices you have with your information. By installing and using the Memeo Software, you consent to these information practices. When you purchase or license products from Memeo, Memeo may collect registration-related information, such as name, home or work addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, etc.), information about your responses to Memeo’s offerings, transaction-related information (such as payment methods, billing information and product purchases) and customer service related information. 

Memeo will use this information to improve its products, to improve your experience and use of Memeo’s products, to fulfill your orders, to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries, and to offer you other products, programs or services that may be of interest to you. The information will not be shared with third parties unless specifically authorized by you or in response to a legal process. Each time you receive any promotions by e-mail from Memeo, you will be given the opportunity in that e-mail to unsubscribe from any further promotions. Keep in mind, however, that you understand and agree that Memeo may continue to contact you about important information concerning your transactions with Memeo, or to provide you with important notices about your Memeo Software. 

Memeo may automatically check your version of the Memeo Software. Memeo may automatically update the Memeo Software on your hardware system to improve the performance and capabilities of the Memeo Software.  Memeo will assign a unique identifying number to the Memeo Software installed on your hardware device. This unique number will not be identified with any of your personal information. Memeo may also query your computer on an anonymous basis to determine if the Memeo Software is running on your system. Memeo will use this anonymous information to improve the Memeo Software and its offerings to you.  You will be given the option to send configuration data and crash reports concerning your use of Memeo Software; you also will be given the option to provide your e-mail address with this information so that Memeo may get in touch with you. Memeo maintains the confidential information you provide in a secure database. Please keep in mind that while Memeo has established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of you information, it cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with the information practices disclosed in this section (for example, in the event of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or policies).
