# Privacy Policy | MemberMouse

At MemberMouse, LLC (“Company”), we respect the privacy of our readers. We are gravely concerned about practices which violate the basic rights of choice and confidentiality.

Here is our covenant with the readers who trust us with their personal information.

We Promise:

1\. **Any e-mail you give us is safe.** We store your data in databases that only the staff of Company have access to. No one besides us will ever get access to your e-mail address.

2\. **Third Party Use.** We’ll never sell you. We never rent out or sell our subscriber lists to third parties like other companies might. So you’ll never receive junk mail or anything from any third-party by entering your details into any of our forms.

3\. **Easy “one-click” unsubscribe.** If you want to get off our list permanently, there’s an “unsubscribe” link in every one of our outgoing e-mails. Just click it and you’re instantly off the list — that means you’ll never receive another e-mail from us (unless you specifically ask to, of course).

The remainder of this Privacy Policy will let you know what kind of information we collect on the website at membermouse.com (the “Site”), how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, what choices you have regarding our use of your information and how you may access some of the data you provide to us.
