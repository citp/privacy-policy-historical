For current customers of the MemberSuite™ software service, we are committed to protecting your privacy. One of the ways in which we demonstrate this commitment is through the care we take to protect the privacy of information which we collect when we host your data on our servers. MemberSuite’ hosting services are provided by a recognized leader in providing secure managed hosting that delivers enterprise-class web infrastructure to businesses of all sizes – including Fortune 100 companies. Our provider operates the MemberSuite servers within their secure, state-of-the-art data center. MemberSuite selected our hosting provider based on their ability to provide fast and redundant access to the Internet, world class facilities, and commitment to high availability for MemberSuite’ applications. MemberSuite has entered into service agreements with our provider, with the objective, among others, of protecting the privacy of the people who use our software.

## Collected Information

Users' names and email addresses ("Customer Information") are collected and maintained in the MemberSuite™ application for purposes of managing the login authentication process, and to allow the application to send notifications to the end user. An example of an application notification would be an email notice informing the user that a scheduled task has been completed.

MemberSuite will not give any Customer Information to a third party, unless we are required to do so in order to comply with the law, or to provide secure credit card processing.

## Cookies

The MemberSuite application utilizes session specific cookies so that only authenticated users can navigate the application. We also support non-session cookies for allowing the user to automatically remember their login credentials to gain access to the application.

## Changes to Personal Information

Our software is configured to enable you to give your end users the means to access their own personal information for the purposes of deleting it, and/or correcting it.

### Changes to Hosting Privacy Policy

MemberSuite will update this policy from time to time. A "last revised" date will always be included on the bottom of the statement. To keep up-to-date with MemberSuite' policy, please check this page periodically.

### Additional Information

By providing you with this Privacy Policy, MemberSuite is pledging its continued commitment to protect the information we collect. We regularly review our information-handling practices to ensure that we are abiding by this policy. If you have any questions about this statement, or our practices as they affect the privacy of hosted data, you can contact us on [security@membersuite.com](mailto:security@membersuite.com)

For more information about the terms of use of this website, contact [info@membersuite.com](mailto:info@membersuite.com).

### Security Statement

MemberSuite provides state-of-the-art data security and privacy to our clients, ensuring that your data is safe around the clock. MemberSuite devotes significant resources to continuously develop our world-class infrastructure. We know that security is paramount to our clients — and we've made it our highest priority.

When you subscribe to MemberSuite, you will enjoy unsurpassed protection and peace-of-mind.

## World-Class Security

We deliver a security infrastructure comprised of current, proven, cutting-edge technologies. MemberSuite delivers the most comprehensive security available — firewalls and encryption devices sourced from leading Internet security vendors, configured by expert professionals, and rigorously tested before going into production.

All hosted environments meet the following physical security requirements…main access monitored with additional access for emergency purposes only; surveillance cameras in facility; access validation with biometric identity check; access only to persons on MemberSuite' approved access list which is managed at the executive level within MemberSuite.

All hosted environments also meet the following electronic security conditions - login validation; creation of accounts only as verified by MemberSuite; secure SSL (encrypted) connections to access servers; servers running behind secure firewall.

One of the options we offer is Secure Socket Layer (SSL). If you implement our SSL option, we will not transmit Customer Information for the particular user interface that has the SSL over the public internet "in the clear", i.e., without it first being encrypted.

MemberSuite imposes strict internal controls over those of its employees with access to Customer Information. Such access is granted only on a need to know basis.

Finally, MemberSuite™ provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.

### Security Measures

  * Continuous deployment of proven, up-to-date security technologies and best practices.
  * Ongoing evaluation of emerging security developments and threats.
  * Commitment to a secure, scalable, hosted system.
  * Security redundancy throughout the MemberSuite architecture.



### Physical Security

Production equipment is located in a secure facility which provides 24-hour physical security through biometric and visual identification, proximity tracking, and video monitoring. Redundant electrical generators, redundant data center chillers and other back-up equipment designed to keep servers up and running are continuously monitored.

### Perimeter Defense

Perimeters of production and corporate networks are protected by firewalls developed by leading security vendors.

### Data Encryption (provided upon request)

MemberSuite offers 128-bit SSL for secure HTTP connections between client computers and our servers.

### User Authentication

Users access MemberSuite’ client websites only with a valid username and password combination, which is optionally encrypted via SSL while in transmission.

### Application Security

Our robust application security model prevents one MemberSuite customer from accessing another's data. This security model is reapplied with every request and enforced for the entire duration of a user session.

### Operating System Security

MemberSuite enforces tight operating system-level security by using a minimal number of entry points to all production servers. All systems are hardened and protected with strong passwords, and maintained at each vendor’s recommended patch level.

### Database Security

Whenever possible, database access is controlled at the operating system and enforced at the database connection. Direct access to production databases is restricted to the production and redundant environments.

### Server Management Security

All data entered into the MemberSuite application by a customer is owned by that customer.

MemberSuite employees do not have direct access to the MemberSuite production equipment, except where necessary for system management, maintenance, monitoring, and back-ups.

Note: Use of the MemberSuite™ services are subject to the terms of use in the customer license agreement. MemberSuite may change its security infrastructure and/or this security data sheet from time to time.
