Tuning Data is used for billing purposes, diagnostic purposes, for the tuning of recommendation engines and to measure television viewership. Shaw creates a database of anonymized and/or aggregated viewing behaviour by pairing Tuning Data with non-sensitive information in Customer files. This helps Shaw understand Customer reactions to television content and advertising. The collection of Tuning Data is critical to operating our video services and cannot be disabled. However, you can choose to opt-out of Shaw's use of Tuning Data in an anonymized and aggregated database by using the process described in Subsection 3.3 below.

Consent is generally required for the collection of Personal Information and the subsequent use or disclosure of the Personal Information. Consent can be either express or implied. The form of consent sought by Shaw may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of Personal Information. In determining the form of consent to use, Shaw takes into account the sensitivity of the information and your reasonable expectation, so that you understand the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use and/or disclosure of Personal Information. Shaw generally seeks express consent when the Personal Information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent is typically appropriate when the Personal Information is less sensitive.

    * **4 - Your role in protecting your Personal Information:**

Please remember that Shaw's Privacy Policy and our use of your Personal Information only applies to the information you provide. We caution that if you disclose Personal Information or personally sensitive data through use of the Internet such as through chat rooms, communities, bulletin boards or other public online forums, this information is not collected by or for Shaw but may be collected and used by other persons or companies over which Shaw has no control. It is your responsibility to review the privacy statements of any person or company to whom you choose to link, from or through the use of any Shaw Internet services. Shaw is not responsible for privacy statements, privacy compliance or other content of any website not owned or managed by Shaw or its affiliate companies. 

Shaw does its best to protect and safeguard Personal Information and we believe there are safeguards you should take as well. Do not share your Personal Information such as bank card numbers, credit card numbers, associated pin numbers or Social Insurance numbers unless you clearly understand the purpose of the request and you know with whom you are dealing. Do not keep sensitive Personal Information in your email inbox or on Webmail. 

Provide Shaw with one acceptable piece of identification, pin number or passphrase, that will be kept in your Customer account, so we can identify you when you call Shaw. If you are asked to assign passwords to connect you to your Personal Information, you should use a combination of letters (upper and lowercases), numbers and symbols and do not use words that can be easily associated with you (example: do not use the name of a family member or pet). We also suggest you change your password regularly. If you are suspicious of any telephone, mail or email promotional campaigns or you suspect fraudulent activity, please contact us at [shaw.privacy@sjrb.ca](mailto:shaw.privacy@sjrb.ca "shaw.privacy@sjrb.ca") to verify that the campaign is a legitimate Shaw activity.
