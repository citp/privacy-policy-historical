# Webs.com - Privacy Policy

### Our Commitment to Your Privacy

This site is owned and operated by Freewebs, Inc. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We want to make your online experience satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policies surrounding the capture and use of that information. We fully appreciate the trust that you place in Webs and make it a priority to protect the personal information that you share with us.

This "Privacy Policy" discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

"Webs" is the collective name for a private service offered by Freewebs, Inc. which provides free web site building tools and free web hosting, or "Services". To access Services, you may be required to provide current, accurate personal information ("Registration Data"), including a valid email address, in order to register for Services as a "Member." As a Member or visitor to any site hosted by Webs (a "user"), by viewing "Content" - which includes text, images, videos, and other media uploaded by Members or Webs and hosted by Webs - you may be subject to all or part this Policy.

Webs is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly gather or use personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13, and we do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to register as a Member.

Please explore our Privacy Policy below to find answers to any questions you may have.

#### What information does Webs gather?

Webs gathers two types of information about users that are subject to our Policy:

  1. Voluntary submissions

Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions made when creating an account on Webs, such as your name or email address. When you log into Webs or upload or post Content, we may also record information such as your IP address. Please understand that when you sign into Webs or post Content, your actions are not anonymous to us.

  2. Aggregated tracking

Information Webs gathers on users through aggregated tracking, primarily through the use of cookies. When you visit Webs and sites hosted by Webs, we may record information such as your software and hardware attributes, the pages you request, and other cookie information. (For more on cookies, please see the section "What are cookies?") 


  


#### Why does Webs gather information about me?

Webs collects personally identifiable information in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Webs may use some of this information for contacting you, customizing the content and advertising you view, improving our services, conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting for clients. We only collect personally identifiable information from you because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to enjoy certain Services. **Under no circumstances do we divulge any personally identifiable information about an individual user to a third party unless mandated by law.**

  


#### How does Webs gather information?

Webs Gathers User Information in the following processes:

  1. Voluntary submissions

In registering for use of our Services, Webs may ask you to provide your email address, date of birth, location, name, and other information. We may also ask for this information from you in order to allow you to perform specific actions using the Services. Webs may ask you to complete voluntary surveys, polls, and other forms of information gathering. As a user on a site hosted by Webs, a Webs Member may solicit information from you by the use of forms, email, forums, or other Content. Information sent to a Webs Member in this manner is not controlled by Webs and is not subject to our Privacy Policy.

  2. Account tracking

Webs may internally track statistics about Members associated with your account, such as login frequency, traffic generated, and services used. Webs may use this information to email you or create custom-made offers from Webs or on behalf of our partners. You may opt out of email offers by clicking the removal link at the bottom of such emails.

  3. Visitor and User Tracking

Webs tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this visitor information with data about individual users. We do break down overall usage statistics according to a Member's domain name, browser type and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string.

Webs sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is not associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not individually track what users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for our users. 


  


#### What are cookies?

Webs may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. These cookies help us to provide you with a better experience. For example, a cookie may be used to store or "remember" your Member login information so that you are not required to manually log into the site at every visit.

The cookie itself may not directly contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal information our cookie contains is information you supply yourself. Our cookies will not read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Webs uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).

Our advertisers and partners may also set cookies through our Services. For more information, please see the section "What about third parties and advertisers?"

  


#### What about third parties and advertisers?

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, a third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Additionally, some links from Webs may lead to websites operated by other companies. While these websites and advertisements may be co-branded with our name or logo, they are not operated or maintained by us. We do not control these cookies and users of Webs Services should check the privacy policy of the relevant advertiser to understand whether and how it uses cookies. Webs is not responsible for websites operated by third parties that are linked to by any of our sites.

Ads appearing on this website, Webs, and sites hosted by Webs are delivered to you by Google Ad Manager, DoubleClick, or other advertising partners. Information about your visits to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about these partners, their cookies, and how to "opt-out," please follow the links below.

  * [Google Ad Manager](http://www.google.com/admanager/policies/en_US/index.html)
  * [DoubleClick](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy)

  


#### How secure is my information?

Webs uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. We limit access to personal information about you to employees whom we believe reasonably need that information to provide support, products, or services to you or to fulfill their roles within our organization.

Although we have established and maintain security procedures to protect your personally identifiable information, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information we possess about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.

For information on the security of billing-related information, please see "What about billing information and payments?"

  


#### How private is the Content I upload?

Any files, text, or other information ("Content") uploaded or created using our Services are by default hosted for the public and are thus publicly accessible unless explicitly protected by the Member's optional password protection portion of the Services. Files in a password protected directory will only be accessible by means of a username and password which the Member will provide, and which it is the sole responsibility of the Member to protect and maintain.

Even if you do not publish links to Content or submit links to a search engine, individuals or search engines may discover and link to your Content by data-mining, guessing the address, spidering sites, or other methods. If you are concerned about the privacy or confidentiality of Content that you produce, please take all appropriate steps to ensure that sensitive materials are password-protected. Webs makes no guarantee as to the reliability or security of the password protection service, which is subject to our Terms and Conditions as all other Webs Services.

  


#### What control do I have over my information?

We give you options wherever necessary and practical to opt-out of or control your information. Such choices include:

"Opting out" - Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users.

Opting to delete and close your Webs account at any time for any reason.

You may access and update your personal information by logging in and visiting your My Account and My Profile areas and following the instructions on those pages, or by contacting customer support. You can delete certain personal information you supplied by visiting your My Profile area, preventing its future use. (If you delete or change some personal information in our registration database, it may in some circumstances still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes).

  


#### How is information shared?

Webs uses the information described above to tailor our content to suit your needs and help us better understand our audience demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. Other than described in the section "What about third parties and advertisers?", we do not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

We have a strict partner policy against "spyware" and "adware" and apply this to all Webs users as well. If you believe that one of our partners, advertisers, or Members is in violation of our spyware policy, please fill out this form to report it.

  


#### What about billing information and payments?

All payment procedures of Webs operate on secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.

Webs **does not store** billing information such as your credit card number, address, or telephone number. These data _may_ be stored by our payment processors and vendors, and are subject to their respective privacy policies and terms.
