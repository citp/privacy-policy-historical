					<p></p>

For this reason, we have adopted the following policy to advise you of our use of your personal information online and your choices regarding that use.

					<p>We gather certain generic information with respect to customers' use of our web site, such as:</p>

							<li>The areas on the web site that they favor</li>
						</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

						<h3>With Whom Dose Meme4u.com Share Information?</h3>

</ul><p></p>

<h3does meme4u.com="" ensure="" the="" security="" and="" privacy="" practices="" of="" other="" sites="" it="" links="" to?="">
<p>
While we carefully select the websites we link to, we are not at fault for the privacy practices or content of these websites. You are under the privacy policy of the operator of that site when you give personal information to them, not the meme4u.com privacy policy. Please read the policy of that site before sharing any information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>USE COMMON SENSE IN ALL YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITIES</h3>
<p>
Even the best policy can't protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your on-line activities.</p>
<p>Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online ecards.</p>
<p>Always monitor your children's on-line activities and educate them as to the rules for safe Internet use.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to review our help center where you can contact us with further questions</p>
