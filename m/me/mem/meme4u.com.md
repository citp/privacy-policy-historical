IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally.

IT IS AVAILABLE TO THE ecard RECIPIENT AND ANYONE ELSE WHO IS FORWARDED THE NOTIFICATION E-MAIL. THIS LIMITS YOUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE ANONYMOUSLY USING PRODUCTS.

There, you can change your address information, e-mail type, sign-in, and e-mail permissions. You can revise, add, delete, or completely cancel all Reminder alerts by navigating to the Reminders "my preferences" section from the "Reminders" links found at the top of each page.

### Contests and Promotions

Occasionally, Meme Interactive Pvt Ltd may sponsor contests or promotions on our sites. Participation in such contests is purely voluntary. In order to enter a contest or promotion, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information. By entering, you agree to all of its terms and conditions, which will be clearly outlined in the rules. Where a contest or promotion is not sponsored by Meme Interactive Pvt, the identity of the sponsor will be clearly disclosed in the rules.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

Meme Interactive Pvt Ltd. will occasionally update this Privacy Policy in response to changing business circumstances and legal developments. When Meme Interactive Pvt Ltd posts changes to this Policy, you will see the word "updated" next to the Privacy Policy link on the front page of meme4u.com.

While we carefully select the websites we link to, we are not at fault for the privacy practices or content of these websites. You are under the privacy policy of the operator of that site when you give personal information to them, not the meme4u.com privacy policy. Please read the policy of that site before sharing any information.

### USE COMMON SENSE IN ALL YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITIES

Even the best policy can't protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your on-line activities.

Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online ecards.

Always monitor your children's on-line activities and educate them as to the rules for safe Internet use.

As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to review our help center where you can contact us with further questions
