					<p>At MemberMouse, LLC (“Company”), we respect the privacy of   our readers. We are gravely concerned about practices which violate the   basic rights of choice and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Here is our covenant with the readers who trust us with their personal information.</p>
<p>We Promise:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Any e-mail you give us is safe.</strong> We store your   data in databases that only the staff of Company have access to. No one   besides us will ever get access to your e-mail address.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Third Party Use.</strong> We’ll never sell you. We never   rent out or sell our subscriber lists to third parties like other   companies might. So you’ll never receive junk mail or anything from any   third-party by entering your details into any of our forms.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Easy “one-click” unsubscribe.</strong> If you want to get   off our list permanently, there’s an “unsubscribe” link in every one of   our outgoing e-mails. Just click it and you’re instantly off the list — that means you’ll never receive another e-mail from us (unless you   specifically ask to, of course).</p>
<p>The remainder of this Privacy Policy will let you know what kind of   information we collect on the website at easieronlinedating.com (the   “Site”), how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, what choices you   have regarding our use of your information and how you may access some   of the data you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Company collects and stores personal information in several ways at   different parts of our Site. This information may include, but is not   limited to, your name, email address, age, gender, address, telephone   number, User ID, User password, and other self-identifying information.   This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize   preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method   for users to submit information to Company, and receive back either the   information, service, or products desired. Company may also request   certain information using online order forms for products and services.   On the order forms, we may collect contact information, demographic   information, method of payment and, if applicable, a credit or debit   card number. We may also collect information about you in surveys or for   sweepstakes and contests on our Site and information about the searches   you perform and the pages you visit on our Site.</p>
<p>Company may also monitor, on an anonymous aggregate basis, patterns   of use in connection with e-mails that it sends out, including which   links are clicked on in our email communications, so that we may use   such information to better personalize the content of our Site and our   mailings for our users. All such information will be protected in   accordance with our Privacy Policy. We may also automatically collect   your Internet Protocol address to help diagnose problems and for system   administration. Company reserves the right to request any additional   information necessary to establish and maintain your account for use of   our Site.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF INFORMATION BY COMPANY</strong></p>
<p>Company will not sell, rent or barter your personal information   other than to its business partners as set forth in this Privacy Policy.   However, we may from time to time aggregate statistical information   regarding our customers, traffic patterns and site usage, or sell our   research, which may contain aggregate information. In addition, we may   report aggregate information to our advertisers. Such aggregate   information will not individually identify any user. Company uses the   information collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.   Information we collect is used to customize your experience at our Site.   We also show you content that we think will be interesting to you, and   display content according to the preferences you indicate while on our   Site. Company may use your information to send you promotional   materials about Company and its partners. We may also use your   information to contact you, if necessary. We reserve the right to   disclose any information if such action is necessary (a) to conform to   the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process or a   subpoena served on Company, (b) to protect and defend the legal rights   or property of Company, our Site, or its users, or (c) in an emergency,   to protect the health and safety of its users or the general public.</p>
<p><strong>CHOICES YOU HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Company will not sell, rent or barter your personal information   other than to its business partners as set forth in this Privacy Policy.   However, we may from time to time aggregate statistical information   regarding our customers, traffic patterns and site usage, or sell our   research, which may contain aggregate information.

<p><strong>“COOKIES,” AND HOW COMPANY USES THEM</strong></p>
<p>For all our transactions, we employ reasonable and current Internet   security methods and technologies. Where appropriate, we password   protect, use encryption techniques and install firewalls. We strive to   protect your privacy. We encourage our participating service providers   to adopt and honor their own consumer privacy policies. For all our   efforts to safeguard your privacy however, no system can be guaranteed.   We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you   transmit to us, or that we transmit to you, or guarantee that it will be   free from unauthorized access by third parties. Once we receive your   information, we use reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our   systems. At Company we take great care and use the latest technologies   to ensure the security and safety of all your transactions with Company.</p>
<p><strong>ACCESSING, CHANGING OR DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>As part of your use of our Site, you are responsible for maintaining   and updating, as applicable, your account registration data with   current, accurate and complete information. You may view, update and/or   edit the registration data you have provided to Company by logging in   to your account and following the appropriate instructions.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ELSE YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>Company may also contain links to other web sites and advertising.   The privacy policies of those web sites and advertisers may   significantly differ from that of our Site, and Company is not   responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites   or for the privacy policies and practices of other third parties. It is   your responsibility to contact such web site operators or advertisers   directly to determine their Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Company reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy   in its discretion at any time without notice to the users of our Site,   except that Company will post the changed or modified Privacy Policy on   our Site as soon as practicable as such changes or modifications are   implemented.</p>
