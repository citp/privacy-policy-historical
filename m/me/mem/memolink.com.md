Memolink » Privacy Policy

|  **Memolink strictly adheres to the Privacy Policy outlined below.**

We will closely guard any personally identifiable information you disclose to us during registration or at any other point during your memolink.com experience. However, information will be shared with a third party if a member requests for that information to be shared. A member may request that this information be shared, by opting in to programs, lists or newsletters or participating in certain offers or promotions that may require information such as, but not limited to, first name, last name, occupation, email address, mailing address, phone number, selected interests or date of birth. Not all offers/programs/lists/opt-ins specify exactly which pieces of information will be shared. Please contact Memolink through [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/) if you would like more information about which offers/programs/lists/opt-ins require certain pieces of information to be shared. 

By joining Memolink, you are opting-in to receive mail from Memolink (referred to as "Memomail"). You can unsubscribe from Memomail at any time and still maintain an active Memolink account. 

**MEMOLINK PRIVACY STATEMENT**

Memolink is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Memolink collects information from our users at several different points on our Website.

If a member wishes to opt out of Memomail or unsubscribe their Memolink account, they may use the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any Memomail. Every Memomail contains a physical address to which a user can mail an unsubscribe request.

**Collection of Account Information**

We collect personal information from the user upon request for reward redemption. Here we ask a user to provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and legitimate proof of address. Proof of address is required in order to guard Memolink and our members from fraudulent activities. This information is also used for shipping purposes to award earned rewards. If we have trouble processing a reward, this contact information may be utilized to contact a user. 

**Disclosure of Account Information**

You authorize Memolink to only disclose to third parties information you have provided, or information that Memolink has obtained about your Memolink account or shopping behavior: (i) to agents and licensors of Memolink or its affiliates, such as independent auditors, consultants or attorneys; (ii) to comply with government agency or court orders or requests; (iii) in providing aggregated and non-personalized marketing services for an advertising or business partner, or (iv) where it is necessary for redemption of your rewards. Further, you authorize Memolink to receive any account information from any business partner including, but not limited to information regarding purchase was made, products ordered, order number, the time and date the purchase occurred and the email address entered for the purchase. You agree to hold the partner harmless for any information disclosed to Memolink. 

**Our Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data we store on the user's hard drive containing information about the user's account and point earnings. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. There are two reasons for the use of cookies on our site. The first reason is that it helps us keep track of the points you earn during a given session. The second reason for using cookies on our site is that it allows you to move throughout our site and complete offers without being prompted by our security system to log in again after each activity. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site, however they will have to log on multiple times and they risk not receiving credit for the points they have earned.  
  
  
**Log Files**

We do track certain information such as type of browser and log-on time for our own use. We use this information only to track where our users may be coming from and what type of software they are using. We keep this information so we can continuously improve our users' online experience and improve the Memolink Website. None of this information can ever be traced back to any specific person and is useful only to Memolink. 

**Links to Other Sites**

This Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Memolink, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Memolink Website. Memolink requests that users report any and all concerns about our partners' privacy practices directly to us through [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/). 

**Security**

This Website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit information via the Website, your information is protected both online and offline. While we use both passwords and user names to protect information online, we also do everything in our power to protect users' information offline. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our Member Support team) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access to your information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment and professionally maintained. If you have any questions about the security at our Website, you can send a request to [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/).  
  
  
**Special Offers and Email**

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. We also require a new user to click on a link inserted in the initial email to verify their account. Memolink does this in order to establish that the email address given upon registration is not fraudulent. Established members will occasionally receive emails containing information regarding new offers or special promotions from Memolink or its partners if they have not opted out. "Opting-out" means the user does not wish to receive emails from memolink.com. When a member receives an email from memolink.com and decides they no longer wish to receive emails or want to be removed from our system, they can open the email and scroll to the bottom. At the bottom of the email page there will be a brief description of how to have an account "opted out". Once we receive information regarding these account changes, we will make the specified changes as soon as possible. Please note that while Memolink can remove you from internal lists, if you have agreed to have your email transmitted to a third party through our site in the past, removal from that list is not guaranteed. 

**Site and Service Announcements**

Under rare circumstances, memolink.com may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an important announcements about the Memolink site or service changes. Members are not able to unsubscribe, or opt out of these announcements, because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Before these measures are taken, however, Memolink will post information regarding changes directly on the Website. Memolink reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information Memolink deems relevant. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

Memolink users are able to change their personal information at any time, with the exception of first and last name. Members must request this information be changed, along with a valid reason for the change. The fastest way to change personal information is to log on to memolink.com and simply click on "change personal info." You will be prompted to enter your password again to change you personal information. If for some reason this page does not work, or there are any questions, users may contact our [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/) team. Unless returned to Memolink, Inc., memolink.com will not be responsible for lost rewards due to an inaccurate address listed in members' accounts.
