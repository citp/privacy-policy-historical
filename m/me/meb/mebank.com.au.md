# Privacy

Members Equity Bank Ltd and its subsidiary ME Portfolio Management Limited (referred to as ME Bank, we us or our) has implemented this Privacy and Credit Reporting Policy to provide you with information about how we collect, hold and use the personal information and credit-related personal information that you provide to us. 

We appreciate that the protection of your personal information, which has been provided in the course of business, is of the utmost importance to you and to us, as is the need to base our relationship on mutual trust. Our management and staff are aware of the need, and are trained, to exercise the utmost discretion in handling your personal information and credit-related personal information.

We will apply our privacy compliance procedures in relation to any personal information and credit-related personal information which we gather in the course of carrying on our business. These are based on privacy legislation including until 12 March 2014, the National Privacy Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information (NPPs), and after 12 March 2014 the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). In addition, our procedures for handling credit-related personal information are based on the requirements for credit reporting set out in Part IIIA of the Privacy Act. We regard all the personal information we have collected from and about you as being equally sensitive and undertake to treat it all in accordance with the principles set out in this Privacy and Credit Reporting Policy.

  * contact details including residential and postal address, telephone numbers (home, work and mobile), email address;
  * bank account details;
  * financial information;
  * name of superannuation fund;
  * contact details for authorised representatives and designated users appointed to operate business deposit account; and
  * information provided in employment applications.



**2.4** In addition, where relevant for credit accounts we may also collect:

**2.8** We may also collect personal information about you via third parties (for example, from our alliance partner organisations). However, we will only collect your personal information in this way if it is unreasonable or impractical to collect this information directly from you or if we are otherwise permitted to do so. To the extent we consider it relevant to assessing your application for consumer or commercial credit, we may obtain a credit report from a credit reporting body that contains personal information.

**2.9** Credit-related Personal Information

We may collect all types of credit information (including repayment history information), credit reporting information and credit eligibility information, being information relevant to our credit products as described below:

  * identification information;
  * type and amount of credit sought in a credit application;
  * default information;
  * payment information if you pay a default previously listed with a credit reporting body;
  * new arrangement information if we vary a consumer credit contract that we’ve previously listed default information about;
  * details about court proceedings;
  * serious credit infringements;
  * consumer credit liability information (the fact that you have applied to us for credit and the amount, the type or the amount of consumer credit provided by us, the account opening date or the closing date for consumer credit); and
  * repayment history information.



Credit information is the basic category of personal information in the credit reporting system. It includes the following types of information collected by us that we may give to a credit reporting body, such as Veda.

Credit information does not include sensitive information – eg criminal record, medical history. 

Credit reporting information means credit information that a credit reporting body holds or personal information a credit reporting body derives from credit information it holds about an individual. This will be the information that we receive from a credit reporting body about a borrower, loan applicant or guarantor. 

Credit eligibility information refers to the information disclosed by a credit reporting body to us; or the information derived by us from that credit reporting information (for example a credit score).

The terms credit information, credit reporting information and credit eligibility information are collectively referred to as credit-related personal information in this Policy.

**2.10** We collect credit-related personal information if you apply for or have a credit product with us. We may use credit-related personal information to create a credit score for you. We also collect credit-related personal information from Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Limited (Veda) (see section 3.5 below)

**2.11** We will:

  * only collect information by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonable or intrusive way;
  * tell you what, in broad outline, we intend to do with your personal information, including -
    * whether we intend to disclose the information to any outside party and if so, the classes of persons or organisations to which it would be disclosed;
    * if there is any relevant law that either requires or allows the collection of that particular information; and
    * the main consequences for you if the information is not supplied;
  * where it is reasonable and practicable to do so, collect personal information directly from you, but, if we have to collect information about you from someone else, we will, wherever possible, obtain your consent where the information is not already in the public domain;
  * ensure that only permitted and accurate information is included in your credit information file, if any;
  * only request or collect a tax file number for the purpose of carrying out responsibilities under taxation law; not collect sensitive information about you unless:
