Introduction

We collect personal information on this website and through our various promotional programs including, but not limited to, mPerks, text alerts, voice messaging alerts, email messaging couponing, and postal mailers ("Promotional Programs"). The following privacy policy applies to Meijer's website ([www.meijer.com](http://www.meijer.com/), the "Site"), personal information we may collect from you at our stores, all Meijer Promotional Programs, and generally to Meijer's collection of personal information, but it does not apply to any websites linked to the Site operated by our retail partners, including, but not limited to the following retail partners: the online photo center (Snapfish), school uniforms (French Toast), and specialty foods (Kehe Food Distributors).

Privacy and Security

Meijer has adopted policies that govern our collection and use of personal information and we expect our team members to comply with these policies. We are accountable for complying with these policies and will take reasonable and timely steps to ensure compliance. Except as described in this Policy or as otherwise required by law, we will not sell, rent or give information which identifies you personally to anyone. Personal information is information about you that is not publicly available and can identify you, such as your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.

What Personal Information Do We Collect?

  * When you visit the Site, our web server automatically recognizes your domain name, IP address, your computer's operating system, browser type, the address of the web page you're coming from and of those pages you visit on our Site. We may store that information and use it to customize content presented to you. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our Site so we can improve it. But, we don't automatically recognize or collect your name, email address, home address or telephone number unless you have specifically provided this information to us on the Site or we have obtained it from offline data.
  * We do collect personal information consisting of the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, the email addresses of those who make postings to user-generated content areas, and information that customers volunteer, such as survey information and the information provided to enter an online sweepstakes.
  * We may collect mobile and other phone numbers as part of our Promotional Programs and we may also collect your name with your phone number when you register for our Promotional Programs. You may choose not to provide this information, but then you will not be eligible to participate in the applicable Promotional Program.
  * When you order goods (including Meijer Gift Cards) available for purchase on our Site, we collect additional personal information including your name, address, phone number, credit card or other payment information (including account numbers and expiration dates), and "ship-to" name and address, if different than your name and address. We collect credit card account numbers and expiration dates each time you make a purchase so that we can process the transaction. You should note that all purchases of Meijer Gift Cards are also subject to our Gift Card Terms and Conditions that can be viewed here.
  * You can correct or change your personal information at [www.meijer.com/user/main.jsp](http://www.meijer.com/user/main.jsp) by signing into your account.
  * We and our partners collect information about you when you visit the Site, such as the pages you visit and product information you view. We may do this by any or all of cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags (also called clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs), and/or iFrames. Cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags and/or iFrames may be placed by Meijer or by one of our partners. The information we collect helps us better manage the Site, provides ease of use of the Site for you, and provides more effective marketing to you.
  * We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on the Site. We may disclose your personal and transactional information with the third party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver to you banner ads and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain third party websites. The service provider may also collect information about your visits to our the Site as well as other third party web sites and your interaction with our products and services by use of cookies, flash cookies or pixel tags for marketing/advertising purposes. The advertising used by our service provider does not include your name, address, or email address.



In addition to collecting personal information on our Site and through the Promotional Programs, we also collect personal information from Meijer in-store transactions and data provided by third parties. At times we match personal information we collect from users of the Site and our Promotional Programs with this offline data in order to carry out our services and conduct target advertising and promotions more effectively.

How Do We Use Your Personal Information?

  * All personal information that we collect may be used to improve our Site, used to customize the content or layout of our Site pages for individual visitors, used to notify customers about updates to the Site, used by us and our service providers to contact customers for marketing purposes, used to communicate with our customers about their orders or accounts (transactional and administrative messages), and used for product recalls.
  * We may also share your personal information with our strategic partners and other third parties that perform services or functions on our behalf (such as credit card payment processing, and order processing, fulfillment and delivery), but their activities are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations. We may also share aggregated data with these parties. Aggregated data is gathered from many different customers and does not contain any personal information.
  * We may use your personal information combined with your Meijer store shopping information to provide special offers tailored to your interests.
  * We may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by the law, is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, imminent bodily harm, or to protect our company or another individual or business. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities. Specifically, we operate cameras in our stores for security and operational purposes and may provide information we collect from our in-store security cameras to third party loss prevention specialists or to law enforcement to assist in their investigations of the crime, but generally will not link security camera information to other information we've collected unless there is a security need.
  * Our use of your personal information will be consistent with this Policy. From time to time, we may use your personal information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post changes to this policy on our Site to notify you of these changes. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, you should check back at the Site periodically.
  * If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.



What About the Privacy Rights of Children?

  * Just like you, we're especially aware of children's privacy issues. We know that parents are justifiably concerned about their children's activities online and what's being done with the information they reveal. That's why we will never intentionally collect information from children under 13, with the exception of email addresses used only for reply purposes. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at [webprivacy@meijer.com.](mailto:webprivacy@meijer.com)



What Security Measures Are in Place with Respect to My Information?

  * We have in place the following security measures: 
    * Our Site is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, meaning that your account data information (including credit card numbers and expiration dates) is protected according to prevailing industry practices. 
    * Internally, we restrict account data information (including credit card numbers and expiration dates) under our control to those persons who have a need to know such information. 

Due to risks inherent in using the Internet and sophisticated third party hackers, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Other than these security measures, you transmit data, including personal information, to us at your own risk.

  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared or public computer. You are responsible to keep your password secret.



How Can You Manage Your Personal Information?

  * When you go to [www.meijer.com/help](http://www.meijer.com/help), there are two prompts, Your Account/Manage Subscriptions, that allow you to manage your personal information. Both of these links will send you to the account sign in. Once signed in, you can (1) change your personal profile, (2) unsubscribe from Meijer emails (other than administrative emails), and (3) manage your subscriptions to certain Promotional Programs.
  * If you've previously opted in to text messaging or prerecorded phone messaging, you may opt out of either at: [ intouch.meijer.com](http://www.intouch.meijer.com/). Look for the opt-out link on that page to access that option. You may also opt-out by calling 800-313-2912.
