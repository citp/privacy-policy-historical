# Meijer: Privacy Statement

| [](http://www.meijer.com/) | **Plain Talk about Internet Privacy**  
---|---  
  
****

****The following privacy statement applies to the Meijer.com web site ("Site"), excluding that portion of the Site designated as MyPhotoAlbum.Meijer.com which is subject to its own privacy statement.

Meijer.com makes every effort to create an online environment that is safe, easy, and respects your privacy. We hold all information you provide in confidence. We will not sell, rent or give your information to anyone without your consent, nor use it for any purpose for which you've not given your consent.

Just like you, we're especially aware of children's privacy issues. We know that parents are justifiably concerned about their children's activities online and what's being done with the information they reveal. That's why we will never intentionally collect information from children under 13, with the exception of email addresses used only for reply purposes. 

The rest of this document outlines in more detail the kind of information Meijer.com collects and what we do with it.

1\. When you visit Meijer.com, our web server automatically recognizes your domain name, your computer's operating system, browser type, the address of the web page you're coming from and of those you visit on our website. (None of this information is personally identifiable and is used only to improve the performance of Meijer.com). Our web server does **NOT** recognize or collect your email address. 

2\. Meijer.com uses contractors (other companies) to perform some services, such as processing, fulfilling and delivering orders, sending postal mail and email, and updating guest information. These contractors have access only to the personal information needed to perform these services, and they will never use such information for any other purpose. 

3\. When you register, enter a contest, opt into an email program, or make a purchase using a credit card, Meijer.com and our contractors may collect and store some or all of the following information: user ID, password, name, shipping and billing addresses, shipping and billing phone numbers, card type, card number, card expiration date, and optional personal information. This information is used by Meijer.com and/or our contractors to bill you for your purchase, ship your order, send email notices, or verify and ship a contest prize. It is never used for any other purpose without your consent.

4\. A "Cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser to be read back from that browser. Cookies are a way to have the browser "remember" specific bits of information. We use "Cookies" to store your preferences and record session information (such as items that you add to your shopping cart).

5\. We archive correspondence of those who communicate with us via email. This information is used only to follow up regarding an email inquiry, contest entry, or an order you've placed online. Your email address will not be used by us or our contractors for any other purpose unless you choose to opt in to an email program, such as ValuPagE-mail.

6\. If you supply us with your postal address online or via email, we will only use that address to contact you regarding information you requested, a contest entry, or an order you've placed online. Your postal address will not be used by us or our contractors for any other purpose.

7\. If you supply us with your telephone number online or via email, we will only use that number to contact you regarding information you requested, a contest entry, or an order you've placed online. Your telephone number will not be used by us or our contractors for any other purpose.

8\. We do not partner with or have any relationships with any ad server companies. This means that these companies cannot place Cookies on your computer or track or monitor your activity while visiting Meijer.com.

Exception: ValuPage, a contractor of Meijer.com, is hosted by SuperMarkets Online (http://www.supermarkets.com). When visiting the ValuPage site, Cookies may be placed on your computer by one or more of the companies who have advertising banners displayed on that site.

9\. From time to time, we may use guest information for new, unanticipated uses. If our information practices change at some time in the future, these changes will be posted on the page you're reading now. At no time will your privacy ever be compromised, and you'll always be asked if you want to opt in to any of these new uses.

10\. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving financial data exchanged with our site.

If you have any comments or questions about your privacy while visiting Meijer.com, please feel free to contact our [Help Center](mailto:help@meijer.com).
