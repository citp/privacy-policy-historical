# Meijer Privacy Statement

| [](https://web.archive.org/) | **Plain Talk about Internet Privacy**  
---|---  
  
The following privacy statement applies to the Meijer.com web site ("Site"), except for the portions of the Site designated as My Photo Lab, ArtSelect™, French Toast School Uniforms®, Hickory Farms®, CoolSavings®, upromise™, and Meijer Credit Card, which are operated by our retail partners and subject to their own privacy statements. Also, the Pharmacy portion of our Site is subject to unique privacy regulations mandated by the federal government.

Meijer.com makes every effort to create an online environment that is safe, easy, and respects your privacy. We won't sell, rent or give information which identifies you personally (“personal information”) to anyone if you've told us not to. 

Just like you, we're especially aware of children's privacy issues. We know that parents are justifiably concerned about their children's activities online and what's being done with the information they reveal. That's why we will never intentionally collect information from children under 13, with the exception of email addresses used only for reply purposes. 

The rest of this statement outlines in more detail the kind of information Meijer.com collects and what we do with it.

  1. When you visit Meijer.com, our web server automatically recognizes your domain name, your computer's operating system, browser type, the address of the web page you're coming from and of those pages you visit on our Site. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our Site so we can improve it. We may also match user information with offline data available from other sources in order to carry out our services and conduct target advertising and promotions more effectively. But we don't automatically recognize or collect your name, home address or telephone number. 
  2. During your visit to Meijer.com, we use “cookies” to store and sometimes track information about you. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered users; research visiting patterns; help target advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail partners in the tracking of visits and the processing of orders; and track the progress and participation in promotions. In some instances, our retail partners and advertisers appearing on our Site may use their own cookies. Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features on our Site may be unavailable. 
  3. Meijer.com uses contractors (other companies hired by us) to perform some services, such as processing, fulfilling and delivering orders, sending postal mail and email, and updating custome information. These contractors have access only to the personal information needed to perform these services, and they will never use such information for any other purpose. 
  4. When you register, enter a contest, participate in an email program, or make a purchase using a credit card, we or our contractors may collect and store some or all of the following information: your user ID, password, name, shipping and billing addresses, shipping and billing phone numbers, card type, card number, card expiration date, and optional personal information. This information is used by us or our contractors to bill you for your purchase, ship your order, send email notices, or verify and ship a contest prize. It may also be shared with our vendors who co-sponsor a contest and our other retail partners.
  5. We archive correspondence of those who communicate with us via email. This information is used to follow up regarding an email inquiry, contest entry, or an order you've placed online. If you supply us with your postal address or telephone number online or via email, we will use that address to contact you regarding information you requested, a contest entry, or an order you've placed online.
  6. We may use your personal information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and features. We may also use your information to furnish you with items targeted to your interests, such as new services and promotions. We may notify you of these new items via e-mail, telephone, or direct mail. You may “opt out” of receiving this information by so indicating in your [My Meijer Account Profile](https://web.archive.org/mymeijer/#subscription) page or by calling 1-800-253-8053. 
  7. From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses. If our information practices significantly change at some time in the future, these changes will be posted on the page you're reading now. At no time will your privacy ever be compromised, and you'll always be asked if you want to opt out of any of these new uses.
  8. In addition to the above, the following privacy provisions apply to the following pages on our Site:


  * Meijer Community Rewards and programs associated with Meijer Guest Cards: 



> > On occasion, customers may provide us with birthdates or credit card account numbers when applying for Meijer card services.
