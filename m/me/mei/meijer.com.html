	The following privacy statement applies to the Meijer.com web site ("Site"), 
	except for the portions of the Site designated as My Photo Lab, ArtSelect™, 
	French Toast School Uniforms®, Hickory Farms®, CoolSavings®, upromise™, and 
	Meijer Credit Card, which are operated by our retail partners and subject to 
	their own privacy statements. Also, the Pharmacy portion of our Site is 
	subject to unique privacy regulations mandated by the federal government.<br>
	<br>
	Meijer.com makes every effort to create an online environment that is safe, 
	easy, and respects your privacy. We won't sell, rent or give information 
	which identifies you personally (“personal information”) to anyone if you've 
	told us not to. <br>
	<br>
	Just like you, we're especially aware of children's privacy issues. We know 
	that parents are justifiably concerned about their children's activities 
	online and what's being done with the information they reveal. That's why we 
	will never intentionally collect information from children under 13, with 
	the exception of email addresses used only for reply purposes. <br>
	<br>
	The rest of this statement outlines in more detail the kind of information 
	Meijer.com collects and what we do with it.</font></p>
	<ol>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">When you visit Meijer.com, our web 
		server automatically recognizes your domain name, your computer's 
		operating system, browser type, the address of the web page you're 
		coming from and of those pages you visit on our Site. We use this data 
		in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our Site 
		so we can improve it. We may also match user information with offline 
		data available from other sources in order to carry out our services and 
		conduct target advertising and promotions more effectively. But we don't 
		automatically recognize or collect your name, home address or telephone 
		number. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">During your visit to Meijer.com, we use 
		“cookies” to store and sometimes track information about you. A “cookie” 
		is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server 
		and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to 
		remind us who you are and enable us to access your information so you do 
		not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by 
		registered or unregistered users; research visiting patterns; help 
		target advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail 
		partners in the tracking of visits and the processing of orders; and 
		track the progress and participation in promotions. In some instances, 
		our retail partners and advertisers appearing on our Site may use their 
		own cookies. Preference and options configurations in your browser 
		determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those 
		configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your 
		preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a 
		cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies 
		are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more 
		often and certain features on our Site may be unavailable. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Meijer.com uses contractors (other 
		companies hired by us) to perform some services, such as processing, 
		fulfilling and delivering orders, sending postal mail and email, and 
		updating custome information. These contractors have access only to the 
		personal information needed to perform these services, and they will 
		never use such information for any other purpose. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">When you register, enter a contest, 
		participate in an email program, or make a purchase using a credit card, 
		we or our contractors may collect and store some or all of the following 
		information: your user ID, password, name, shipping and billing 
		addresses, shipping and billing phone numbers, card type, card number, 
		card expiration date, and optional personal information. This 
		information is used by us or our contractors to bill you for your 
		purchase, ship your order, send email notices, or verify and ship a 
		contest prize. It may also be shared with our vendors who co-sponsor a 
		contest and our other retail partners.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We archive correspondence of those who 
		communicate with us via email. This information is used to follow up 
		regarding an email inquiry, contest entry, or an order you've placed 
		online. If you supply us with your postal address or telephone number 
		online or via email, we will use that address to contact you regarding 
		information you requested, a contest entry, or an order you've placed 
		online.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We may use your personal information to 
		improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze 
		site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to 
		customize our site's content, layout, and features. We may also use your 
		information to furnish you with items targeted to your interests, such 
		as new services and promotions. We may notify you of these new items via 
		e-mail, telephone, or direct mail. You may “opt out” of receiving this 
		information by so indicating in your
		<a href="/mymeijer/#subscription">My Meijer Account Profile</a> 
		page or by calling 1-800-253-8053. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">From time to time, we may use customer 
		information for new, unanticipated uses. If our information practices 
		significantly change at some time in the future, these changes will be 
		posted on the page you're reading now. At no time will your privacy ever 
		be compromised, and you'll always be asked if you want to opt out of any 
		of these new uses.</font></li>

		privacy provisions apply to the following pages on our Site:</font></li>
