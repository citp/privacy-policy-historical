MexGrocer.com is strongly committed to protecting the privacy 
  of its customers. We have written this privacy policy to inform you of the specific 
  information that we collect from you, how we use this information, and what 
  options you have in sharing this information with us when you visit our site. 
  Protecting your privacy is a significant part of MexGrocer.com's commitment 
  to providing you with a high quality shopping experience.



 Information 
  Collection and Use&amp;nbsp;

MexGrocer.com 
  is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, 
  share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed 
  in this statement. MexGrocer.com collects information from our users at several 
  different points on our website.



Order&amp;nbsp;

We 
  request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide 
  contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information 
  (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing 
  purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, 
  this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. MexGrocer does 
  not process credit card transactions directly; this site is hosted by Yahoo! Store. Yahoo! hosts the store pages, ordering system, and order data. Yahoo! automatically collects order information but may only use this information in the aggregate. If you accessed this store through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically collects information about your shopping experience. Please see the Yahoo! Privacy Policy for more information about how Yahoo! uses this information.



Corrections/Updating 
  Personal Information

At 
  any time, customers of MexGrocer.com can verify that the information we have about 
  your order is accurate by checking on the status of your order throught the link sent on the confirmation email. If anything is incorrect, please call us or contact us via our customer service form within our HELP section. You will receive an email confirmation with any changes 
  or corrections you have done to your order.

Cookies&amp;nbsp;

MexGrocer 
  will store a persistent cookie so that you may retrieve the products in your 
  shopping cart with no need to go through re-choosing all the categories again. 
  This website's cookies are not tied to any personally identifiable information. 
  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log 
  in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user 
  rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is 
  that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user 
  will not be able to process through our shopping area. Cookies can also enable 
  us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience 
  on our site or track impressions and click throughs on the banners that are served on the Web site without any capture of personal information. 

Affiliate 
  Programs

We 
  use Commission Junction to run our affiliate programs for advertising 
  purposes to increase MexGrocer’s brand awareness and the store’s existence to 
  larger communities of websites. When a company signs up for an Affiliate Program 
  (apply ONLY to corporations) within the MexGrocer website, the information is 
  collected and stored  by Commission Junction. 
  The usage of this 
  cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. Even though the page has the look and the feel of the mexgrocer website.

Log 
  Files&amp;nbsp;

We 
  use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, 
  and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are 
  not linked to personally identifiable information.

Sharing 

We 
  will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
  This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual 
  person. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please contact them directly. 
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
Third-Party Web Beacons: We use third-party web beacons from Yahoo! to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website. Yahoo! may also use anonymous information about your visits to this and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Yahoo!, click here.


We 
  use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing 
  company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, 
  share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

Links&amp;nbsp;

This 
  web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that MexGrocer.com is 
  not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage 
  our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements 
  of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by MexGrocer.com.

Newsletter&amp;nbsp;

If 
  a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information 
  such as name and email address. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

Refer-A-Friend&amp;nbsp;

If 
  a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, 
  we ask them for the friend's name and email address. MexGrocer.com will automatically 
  send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. MexGrocer.com 
  stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 
  The friend may contact MexGrocer.com at info@mexgrocer.com to request the removal 
  of this information from their database

Security&amp;nbsp;

This 
  website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users 
  submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected 
  both online and off-line.

When 
  our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such 
  as credit card number and/or contact information), that information is encrypted 
  and is protected with 128 bit encryption software from VeriSign - SSL. While 
  on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web 
  browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes 
  locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn 
  more about SSL, follow this link VeriSign. All sensitive information is collected through the online store hosted by our third party service provider.

While 
  we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything 
  in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, 
  not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. 
  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, 
  a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable 
  information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they 
  leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain 
  access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on 
  our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies 
  are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we 
  place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information 
  is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information 
  on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If 
  you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email 
  to info@mexgrocer.com.

Administrative 
  Email Communications

You 
  will receive administrative emails that are related to the primary usage of 
  our service. You may not opt-out of administrative emails. These administrative 
  emails will not have any marketing, promotional or advertising material(s) in 
  them.

Choice/Opt-out&amp;nbsp;

Users 
  who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to “REMOVE” or “Unsubscribe” 
  in the subject line in the email sent out or email us at info@mexgrocer.com and let us know that you want to 
  opt-out of further newsletter communications.

Notification 
  of Changes&amp;nbsp;

If 
  we decide to change our privacy policy, we will prominently post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always 
  aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
  if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable 
  information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, 
  we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether 
  or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information 
  in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

Our 
  Guarantee

We 
  are so confident about the security of our site that we back every purchase 
  with this guarantee: If using your credit card on our site results in subsequent 
  unauthorized use of your card, we'll cover your liability up to $50. The unauthorized 
  use must have resulted from giving your credit card information to MexGrocer.com 
  - not from fault of your own. Our guarantee applies only if your credit card 
  information was given to us over the MexGrocer.com secure server.

If 
  you discover unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify MexGrocer.com 
  of the problem in writing (by email or letter) within 24 hours of discovery. 
  You must also notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting 
  rules and procedures. We limit our Safe Shopping Guarantee to $50 because your 
  credit card provider likely will either cover the unauthorized charges altogether, 
  or limit your liability to $50 or less. Your card user agreement will have the 
  details.

Legal 
  Disclaimer

Though 
  we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need to disclose personal 
  information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action 
  is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal 
  process served on our Web site.
