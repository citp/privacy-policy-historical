                	<em>effective September 14, 2010</em><br><br>
                	<p>This page sets forth the privacy policies and practices of ValueClick Brands, Inc.'s ("ValueClick Brands") site <a href="http://www.valueclickbrands.com" target="_blank">http://www.valueclickbrands.com</a> ("ValueClick Brands Site"). The information collection practices of ValueClick Brands’ other sites are detailed by the privacy policies, if any, found on such websites.</p>
                	<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because by visiting this site and sharing information with ValueClick Brands you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy unless you offer different terms which are accepted by ValueClick Brands in writing.</p>
                	<p>To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and a written agreement to which ValueClick Brands is a party, the terms of such agreement shall prevail with respect to the parties to that agreement.</p>

                	<p><strong>STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING</strong></p>
                	<p>ValueClick Brands's information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In accordance with these beliefs, ValueClick Brands creates results for advertisers and publishers in revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy.</p>
                	<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@valueclickbrands.com">privacy@valueclickbrands.com</a>.</p>
                	<p><strong>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
                	<p>ValueClick Brands Site is not directed towards individual Internet consumers nor does it seek any personally identifiable information ("PII") from such consumers for marketing purposes. The only PII that may be collected is when a consumer seeks information from ValueClick Brands and contacts ValueClick Brands on his/her own accord by e-mail or through a contact form or otherwise.</p>
                	<p>Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, platform type, third party web analytic tools, cookies, web beacons and date/time stamp. We use the information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand usage and navigation trends in aggregate, and determine the relevance of content.</p>
                	<p><strong>II. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
                	<p>ValueClick Brands may share information with its affiliated entities for or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the ValueClick Brands companies and/or sites. ValueClick Brands also may release information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ValueClick Brands or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
                	<p><strong>III. CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS</strong></p>
                	<p> You will have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Please see your browser supplier's Web site for details on how to do this.</p>
                	<p><strong>IV. SECURITY</strong></p>
                	<p>ValueClick Brands employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of data. ValueClick Brands may have contracts in place with its partners and affiliates in relation to their data, which data is handled in accordance with such agreements or as otherwise agreed upon by such parties. ValueClick Brands routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.</p>
                	<p>No transmission of data over the Internet, however, is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of ValueClick Brands to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.

                	<p>The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America (“US”).

In the first instance, European Union citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@valueclickbrands.com">privacy@valueclickbrands.com</a>. ValueClick Brands has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Safe Harbor, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Thus, if you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by ValueClick Brands you may contact:</p>
