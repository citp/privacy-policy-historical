**STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING**

ValueClick Brands's information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In accordance with these beliefs, ValueClick Brands creates results for advertisers and publishers in revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, email us at [privacy@valueclickbrands.com](mailto:privacy@valueclickbrands.com).

**I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

ValueClick Brands Site is not directed towards individual Internet consumers nor does it seek any personally identifiable information ("PII") from such consumers for marketing purposes. The only PII that may be collected is when a consumer seeks information from ValueClick Brands and contacts ValueClick Brands on his/her own accord by e-mail or through a contact form or otherwise.

Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, platform type, third party web analytic tools, cookies, web beacons and date/time stamp. We use the information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand usage and navigation trends in aggregate, and determine the relevance of content.

**II. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT**

ValueClick Brands may share information with its affiliated entities for or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the ValueClick Brands companies and/or sites. ValueClick Brands also may release information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ValueClick Brands or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

**III. CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS**

You will have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Please see your browser supplier's Web site for details on how to do this.

**IV. SECURITY**

ValueClick Brands employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of data. ValueClick Brands may have contracts in place with its partners and affiliates in relation to their data, which data is handled in accordance with such agreements or as otherwise agreed upon by such parties. ValueClick Brands routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.

No transmission of data over the Internet, however, is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of ValueClick Brands to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your information, ValueClick Brands cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with us.

**V. CONSENT AND CHANGES**

ValueClick Brands may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

**VI. DATA PROCESSING/SAFE HARBOR**

We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>. 

In compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. In the first instance, European Union citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact us by emailing [privacy@valueclickbrands.com](mailto:privacy@valueclickbrands.com). ValueClick Brands has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Safe Harbor, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
