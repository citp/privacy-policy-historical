The Met Office takes great care to ensure the security of this site and your personal information. Where credit card information is collected, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or equivalent secure technology. 

SSL is the industry standard method of encrypting personal information and credit card details so that they can be securely transferred over the internet. This means that you can purchase on-line with complete peace of mind. Further information is available on our security policy.
