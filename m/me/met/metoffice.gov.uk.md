## Where we store and process your personal information

The Met Office is responsible for the processing of your personal information and is based in the United Kingdom.

We will not transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless suitable safeguards are in place.

Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission. For further details, see [European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en)

For further details, see [European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)
  * Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between Europe and the United States. For further details, see [European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en)



Our technology services providers or other contracted service providers may also have access or store data for us, but solely for use on behalf of the Met Office in accordance with our instructions and under our control. 

You may be able to access your own registration details over the Internet from locations abroad. This privacy policy covers just processing by the Met Office and does not cover any processing which may be carried out by your Internet service provider.

You may also access your registration details through the relevant customer administration page, using your customer password. Access is strictly controlled and password protected. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Met Office websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

## Disclosure of your information

We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purposes.  If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

We may share your personal information with our external third party processors for the purposes of the provision of our services to you and to help us improve our services.

## Met Office App

### The data we collect about you

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal information about you as follows:   

  * Contact Data
  * Transaction Data
  * Device Data
  * Content Data
  * Profile Data
  * Usage Data
  * Marketing and Communications Data
  * Location Data



These categories of data are explained further below.

We also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data to provide us with insight into users experience within the App.  Our analytics helps us understand how our products are being used to help user experience. We also use analytics to identify when there is a problem with the App. For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific App feature. You have the ability within the App to switch your analytics preferences to “off” if you wish.    

We do not collect any special categories of personal information about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.  

### How is your personal information collected?

We will collect and process the following data about you:  

  * Information you give us. This is information (including Identity, Contact, and Marketing and Communications Data) you consent to giving us about you. It can include information you provide when you download or register an App, search for an App, enter a competition, promotion or survey, and when you report a problem with an App
  * If you contact us, we will keep a record of that correspondence
  * Information we collect about you and your device. With your consent, each time you use our App we will automatically collect personal data including Device, Content and Usage Data. We collect this data using App storage technology
  * Location Data: We also use device GPS to determine your current location, both for analytics purposes (crash reporting) and to deliver you location-specific weather forecasts. Some of our location-enabled services require your personal information for the feature to work. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling Location Data in your settings, or to disable analytics (crash reporting) you can do this in the settings on the App
  * Unique application numbers. When you want to install or uninstall a service containing a unique application number or when such a service searches for automatic updates, that number and information about your installation, for example, the type of operating system, may be sent to us.



### Tracking technologies

We use App data to distinguish you from other users of the App on the distribution platform (Appstore) to remember your preferences. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use the App and also allows us to improve the App.

### Purposes for which we will use your personal information

To install the App and register you as a new App user (Consent)

To manage our relationship with you including notifying you of changes to the App or any services and to deliver our services (Consent, Contractual Necessity, Legitimate Interests)

To enable you to participate in a prize draw, competition or complete a survey (Consent, Legitimate Interests)

To administer and protect our business and this App including troubleshooting, data analysis and system testing (Legitimate Interests)

To measure and analyse the effectiveness of the advertising we serve you and to monitor trends so we can improve the App (Consent, Legitimate Interests).

To deliver content and advertisements (including personalised advertisements) to you (Consent).

With your consent (provided through the App) we will process your personal information to deliver you adverts more relevant to you (Personalised Advertising). You can withdraw your consent at any time within the App. If you do not consent to this, we will still deliver you advertising but it will be less relevant and does not rely on the collection of your personal information (Non-personalised Advertising). You should also note that you may also see personalised adverts that rely on your consent given through another App not related to the Met Office if that App uses the same platform to deliver adverts as the Met Office.  

Although the Met Office cannot directly control your Non-personalised Advertising settings for you, there are some steps that **you** can take to further control these yourself:

  * Settings can apply differently across web browser and mobile platforms, if you are accessing Met Office services though the web browser on your mobile device, you should follow the instructions given in our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/about-us/legal/cookies). However, mobile applications use different technologies to recognise your device. To turn off your App usage data being used to target advertising within apps on your device generally you should follow the instructions below:



#### Apple iOS

1\. Go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising.

2\. Turn on Limit Ad Tracking.

#### Google Android

1\. Go to Settings.

2\. Select Google in the Accounts section.

3\. Select Ads in the Privacy section.

4\. Tick Opt out of interest based ads.

#### Microsoft Windows

1\. Go to Settings.

2\. Tap on Privacy.

3\. Tap on Advertising ID, and turn off Let apps use my advertising ID for experiences across apps
