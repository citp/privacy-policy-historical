                        <p>We have created this privacy statement in order to 
                        demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We are 
                        committed to protecting your privacy and the security of 
                        information you provide to us. We will not sell, rent, 
                        lease or disclose customer information to third parties 
                        unless required by law or unless you provide consent to 
                        such a disclosure. Other terms of our privacy policy are 
                        as follows: </p>
                        <p><b>Information collection</b><br>When you engage in

                        to our collection, use, and disclosure of such 
                        information for the purposes of providing the services 
                        to you as outlined herein. Any information you post to a

                        <p><b>How we use your information</b><br>Any information 
                        collected will be used only by <b>metadefender.com</b> to

                        expiration date (if paying by credit card). We will use 
                        this information only for matters related to your order 
                        or product registration unless you request otherwise. 
                        Your credit card information will be maintained only for 
                        a period reasonably necessary to ensure payment has been 
                        received. </p>
                        <p><b>Product registration</b><br>If, after or during 
                        purchase, you choose to register your <b>Metadefender</b> 
                        software, any information you provide will only be used 
                        to improve the service provided to you as a result of 
                        your registration. The details of information we gather 
                        will be used to uniquely identify your relationship to 
                        an <b>Metadefender</b> software application and 
                        potentially to support communication with you including: 
                        notification of software updates and service releases, 
                        notice of changes in policy that relate to the use of 
                        your software, and the provision to you of prioritized 
                        customer service or technical support. </p>
                        <p><b>Security of your personal information</b><br>We 
                        take the protection of the personal information you 
                        provide very seriously. Personal information collected 
                        is stored in servers with limited access. When passing 
                        information over the Internet through our service, 
                        information is protected through the use of encryption, 
                        specifically through the use of the Secure Socket Layer 
                        (SSL) protocol. However, perfect security on the 
                        Internet does not yet exist and we cannot warrant that 
                        our transfer of data is impenetrable or invulnerable to 
                        hackers. We may hire certain outside contractors to 
                        perform services or functions on our behalf (such as 
                        customer support, packaging &amp; shipping). We will 
                        only provide those companies the personal information 
                        they need to complete the desired service. They are not 
                        permitted to use customer information for any other 
                        purpose and are obligated to keep your customer 
                        information confidential. </p>
                        <p>Information submitted to us may be transferred across 
                        national boundaries. We will only disclose information 
                        if required to do so by law or legal process. </p>
                        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our 
                        online privacy policy or should you wish to withdraw 
                        your consent, contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@metadefender.com">here</a>.
