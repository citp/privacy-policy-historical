<p>The protection of personal information in the private sector is required by the <strong>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</strong> and the Information <b>Privacy Act 2000 (Vic)</b> (collectively the “<b>Privacy Laws</b>”) and we are bound to comply with these Privacy Laws. All of our employees and officers are expected to comply with the Privacy Laws and our policies and procedures concerning the protection of personal information.</p>
<p>Our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information are set out in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; This Policy does not apply to the records for current or former employees of Metro as the relevant privacy policy for such records is covered in a separate document.</p>
<p>This policy is based on the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>privacy of personal information is of paramount importance to us;</li>
<li>your personal information will not be disclosed, other than in accordance with this policy without your permission or in accordance with the Privacy Laws; and</li>
<li>we will only use your personal information for purposes for which it was collected, as set out in this policy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>
<p>We may collect personal information about you, including your name, date of birth, address, telephone number, email address and occupation. We may also collect information concerning your use of our services and other information concerning our dealings with you.</p>
<h3>How do we collect personal information?</h3>
<p>We collect personal information through a variety of ways. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>directly from you, for example when you provide information via our web site, on an application form or when speaking to our representatives;</li>
<li>from third parties, for example from credit reporting agencies, your agents or Public Transport Victoria (“<b>PTV</b>”);</li>
<li>from publicly available sources; and</li>
<li>from our records of your dealings with us (including through your use of our web site).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you provide us with the personal information of another person, we rely on you to inform that person and obtain their consent for the disclosure by you to us of their personal information.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why do we collect and how do we use personal information</h3>
<p>Metro only collects personal information where it is reasonably necessary for one or more of its functions or activities and it is collected by lawful and fair means. Metro does not seek to collect more information than is necessary or relevant.</p>

This may include through sending you information via mail, email, SMS and telephone for example.&nbsp; However, Metro will not use or disclose personal information for direct marketing unless the information:</p>
<ul>
<li>is collected directly from you, and</li>
<li>you would reasonably expect direct marketing, and</li>
<li>there is a simple means to opt out.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may opt out of any such direct marketing at any time.</p>
<hr>
