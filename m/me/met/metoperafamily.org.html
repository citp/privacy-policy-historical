As part of our commitment to your privacy, we support and adhere to the guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct Marketing Association’s Privacy Promise to American Consumers.
</p>
<p>
	We have prepared this policy statement so you will be aware of what information is collected about visitors to our web sites and how that information is used.  From time to time, our practices may change necessitating changes to the policy as it exists now.   We encourage you to refer back to this page to see the policy in effect at the time of your use and, if you wish, change your user preferences.  
</p>
<p>
	By using any of our web sites, or communicating with us by e-mail, you are deemed to have assented and agreed to this policy as in effect at the time of your use.
</p>

	<h4>What Information About You Is Collected and How Is It Used? </h4>
	
<p>
	<b>Anonymous Information</b>
</p>
<p>
	You can browse our sites without logging on, and no personal information about you or your visit will be collected. Some anonymous, statistical information is automatically logged when you access one of our sites. These "access logs" allow us to make our sites more useful to you and others who use them by, for example, tracking which features of the site are most used by visitors.  None of this information, which is listed below, is associated with any personal information or contains anything identifying you personally: 
</p>	
<ul>
	<li>The date of the visit</li> 
	<li>The time of arrival and length of visit </li>
	<li>The browser used (e.g., AOL, Netscape, Safari, etc.) </li>
	<li>A list of files downloaded or pages viewed </li>
	<li>The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the machine through which the site was accessed</li>
	<li>Any errors encountered</li>
</ul>

<p><b>"Cookies"</b></p>
<p>
	A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier that is automatically stored on the hard drive of a computer that accesses a web site.  It allows our systems to recognize your browser’s access privileges and to personalize your session with us. We do not share information from cookies with any third parties. If you do not wish a cookie to be placed on your computer, however, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly, although doing so will limit the range of features that will be available for your use on our site.  (For example, you must have cookies turned on to place items in your shopping cart, or to access certain other content, e.g., “Standing Room”).

	When a user of our web sites requests brochures, enters quizzes, or purchases a membership, tickets, merchandise, or other items, we must have the information necessary to process the transaction: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and, when applicable, credit card number.  For reasons of security, no credit card information is shared with any third parties or stored permanently on our web server.  If a user registers at our sites, but does not make a request or purchase, this same information, is collected with the exception of credit card information.  <br>
	In addition to using your name and contact information to fulfill your requests, process your transactions or to award prizes, your name and contact information will be added to our database, and we may perform statistical analyses of user behavior to measure interest in the various areas of our sites.  You may receive direct mail or telemarketing calls from The Met and the Guild.  Although we sometimes make names and addresses available to select organizations for direct mail marketing  purposes, with the exception of American Ballet Theatre, we do not provide our lists to any organizations for e-mail or telemarketing use.
</p>
<p>
	We may release information if we are required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that it is necessary to comply with the law or legal process served on us or protect and defend our legitimate business interests, rights or property or rights of our customers and patrons.
</p>
<p>
	If you communicate with us by letter, e-mail, phone or in person, it is possible that information about the communication may be collected into a file specific to you.
