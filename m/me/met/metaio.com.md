**Privacy Policy**

metaio GmbH (" ** _metaio_** ") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of the information that we collect and receive from users of the metaio website (the **"Site"** ), metaio products (the **"Products"** ) and the metaio Developer Portal (collectively the " ** _Services_** "). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. 

As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer or a mobile device, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally. 

By using the metaio Services, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage and other such uses of the information collected as described under this Privacy Policy. This consent is valid regardless of how you are using the metaio Services and regardless of residence or where information is being shared from. 

**Information Collection and Use**

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Services. 

Personal Information. When using our Services, we may ask that you provide us with some personally identifiable information - information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, and information on your use or potential use of the Services and related services (" ** _Personal Information_** "). Personal Information that we might collect includes information like your name, email address, and your work and home address. Personal Information may also include other information you supply to us concerning your preferences and interests expressed in the course of using the Services. 

We use Personal Information for the following purposes: (i) to administer the Services, (ii) to enable users to easily navigate the Services, (iii) to provide, improve and optimize the Services, (iv) to better understand users needs and interests, (iv) to personalize your experience, (v) to provide you with software updates and/or product announcements, and (vi) to provide you with further information and offers from us that we believe you may find useful or interesting. 

Usage Information. When you use certain Services, our servers will automatically record information that you send or transmit, including, but not limited to, the model and device ID number of your mobile device, user settings, location and information about your use of the Services (" ** _Usage Information_** "). We use this information to provide and improve the Services, develop new products, and offer products and services that may be of interest to you. 

_Log Data_. When you visit or use the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (" ** _Log Data_** "). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (" ** _IP_** ") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Services and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Site and to analyze and understand how our Site is used. 

_Cookies_. We use "cookies" on our Site to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your search preferences and Personal Information and registration ID and login password for future use of the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you leave or log off from the Site and then close your browser. Third-party advertisers through the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionality of the Site. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not share Personal Information with third parties except as follows:

  * Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related Services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.


  * Aggregate Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose aggregated Usage Information and Log Data with third parties (including suppliers, advertisers, research companies and other organizations) for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.


  * Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. metaio cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of metaio or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.


  * Business Transfers. We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.



**Changing or Deleting Your Information**

All registered users may review, update, correct or delete their Personal Information by contacting us or by making the appropriate modifications in your user account preferences through the Site and/or the Products and/or the metaio Developer Portal. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record. 

**Security**

metaio is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting through the Services in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. 

**International Transfer**

Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located in countries within and outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Prior to such transfer, we will endeavor to take reasonable steps to protect the privacy rights with respective to your information. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. 

**Our Policy regarding Children**

The Services is not directed to children under 15. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 15. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, contact us and we will delete such information from our files. If we become aware that a child under 15 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
