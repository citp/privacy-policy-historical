# Privacy Policy - Framingham, MA - The MetroWest Daily News

**Information Collection and Use.**

Enterprise NewsMedia, LLC recognizes the importance of protecting the information that we collect from its participants during the process of registering for interactive services, ordering products or services, or other area of the Enterprise NewsMedia Websites. It is our policy to use the information we acquire through the registration process or through user postings at our sites for internal business uses only, and we maintain appropriate security measures to keep this information private.

If you choose to register with Enterprise NewsMedia, we will ask for certain identifiable information, such as name, mailing address, valid email address. Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us at registration, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your "account." We will communicate with you by email or as otherwise directed by you.

Enterprise NewsMedia will strive to keep personal information--such as your name or e-mail address--that you voluntarily disclose private. We will not share your personal information with third parties aside from entities that perform services for us, that either are bound to comply with our Privacy Statement or have comparable privacy policies that protect your information.

If you purchase a product or service from us, or through us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as credit card number, expiration date.) We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

Certain information supplied by you to our Websites may be password-protected, and you should take appropriate measures to protect the secrecy of your password. If you use a computer in a public place or share a computer with others, remember to sign out and close your browser window when you finish accessing our Site in order to prevent others from accessing your personal information. You are solely responsible for the control and use of each password you create.

Personal information which you provide on bulletin boards or in areas that are accessible to other users could be collected and disclosed by others. Enterprise NewsMedia cannot take any responsibility for such collection or disclosure.

Enterprise NewsMedia may disclose information you have provided to us if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on Enterprise NewsMedia; or (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Enterprise NewsMedia.

If we gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income), we will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.

Occasionally, Enterprise NewsMedia uses "cookies" to store pertinent user information during a session. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a designated file on your computer. Enterprise NewsMedia only uses cookies for the purpose of holding information during online sessions (for example, to hold answers to online surveys for short-term storage, or to create a temporary ID for use in a multiple-session assessment). When you view an ad for the Enterprise NewsMedia Websites on other sites, third party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The Enterprise NewsMedia Websites and the advertiser may also use invisible images (often referred to as pixel tags, clear GIFs or web beacons) to note which website pages you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track responses to our advertising efforts.

**Children's On-line Privacy Information**

These Websites are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not intend to collect any personal information or data from individuals who identify themselves as being under the age of 13.

Involvement of parents: In accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Act, in the event Enterprise NewsMedia does begin collecting any personal information or data from children under the age of 13, we will notify parents first, and will seek parental or guardian consent to collect, use and/or disclose certain personal information from children under the age of 13. A parent may review and have deleted their child's personal information, and may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information by contacting Enterprise NewsMedia as noted above. Parents may consent to our collection and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to others.

We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 although certain third party sites that we link to may do so. These third-party sites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide information on the Enterprise NewsMedia Websites without their permission.

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

Enterprise NewsMedia has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate database. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures reasonably designed to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

In addition, personnel who have access to our database are trained to maintain and secure all information. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet.

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

**Site Use Data**

Enterprise NewsMedia may also collect other information from users to the Websites such as the user's IP address (the number assigned automatically to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web), length of time spent on the Websites, and the pages accessed during each visit to the Websites.

Enterprise NewsMedia uses this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Links to Other Sites**

The Websites may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that Enterprise NewsMedia is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Enterprise NewsMedia encourages users to be aware that when they leave the Enterprise NewsMedia Websites for another site, even if through a link, they should read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Statement solely applies to information collected by the Enterprise NewsMedia Websites. The fact that we provide any external links is not meant to indicate that we endorse the linked company or its products or services.

**Changes or Updates to this Privacy Statement.**

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so please review it frequently, as we will post a variation on the Websites. We indicate the date of the current version below, so you know when it was last updated.
