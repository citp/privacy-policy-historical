MetaMask provides this Privacy Policy to help you understand how your personal information is used by us and your choices regarding our use of it.</p>
          <p>1.2 This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with our Terms of Use. By accessing the Service, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
