# AAHAnet.org Privacy Statement

  
The American Animal Hospital Association respects the privacy of all AAHAnet.org website visitors. AAHAnet.org does not collect any information from visitors without their prior approval. The following document details AAHA's commitment to website privacy.

Online purchase of products/services  
Orders for AAHA products and services, including books, brochures, videos, magazine subscriptions, and meeting registrations, can be placed through the AAHAnet.org website. These online transactions are made via a secure server that utilizes data encryption. Purchasing information, including email addresses, is not shared with any third parties. User purchasing information that is collected is used to check the user's qualifications and bill the user for products and services. AAHA also uses the information to send the user information about AAHA.

Membership applications  
Applications for AAHA membership can be submitted through the AAHAnet.org website. These transactions are made via a secure server that utilizes data encryption. 

AAHA occasionally rents the list of member names and postal addresses to third parties. Prior to renting these lists, AAHA approves all promotional mailings from third parties to ensure the information is applicable and of general interest to AAHA members. The email addresses, phone numbers and fax numbers of AAHA members are not sold to third parties. 

Email  
AAHA regularly distributes a newsletter via email to AAHA members. The association also may occasionally send email announcements to AAHA members regarding new AAHA products, services and information. These email messages may be sent to website visitors that have provided an email address and have indicated a desire to receive such announcements. 

All broadcast e-newsletters and email messages give individuals the ability to "opt out" of receiving similar future AAHA email announcements. Email addresses collected from members and/or through AAHAnet.org are not sold to third parties. 

Cookies  
AAHA uses cookie technology for certain features of this website. The site includes session cookies for the Members Only and discussion forum sections, as well as for the sections where AAHA products and services are offered for sale. These session cookies are temporary files that self-terminate either when the user closes the web browser, or at an expiration date.

Visitors also have the option to set a permanent cookie, which allows entry to the Members Only section without the input of a username and password. To access the Members Only section, the member's browser must be set to accept cookies. 

Log files  
In order to improve the functionality of the AAHAnet.org website, AAHA collects personally non-identifiable log files from visitors and analyzes this aggregate data. AAHA may share basic website traffic information, such as the number of page views, hits, and unique visitors with sponsors and/or advertisers.

Links  
AAHAnet.org includes links to other websites. AAHA is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by AAHAnet.org.

Message Boards  
AAHAnet.org makes message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and the user should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information. AAHAnet.org cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information the user transmits and the user does so at user's own risk. It is not AAHA's responsibility for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords the user sets up and/or any account information disclosed.

Changes  
AAHA reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement from time to time. Such changes will be posted on AAHAnet.org.

Service Announcements  
It may be necessary for AAHA to send users a service-related announcement for situations such as a temporary suspension of service. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications.
