**Information Sharing and Disclosure**   
Unless stated otherwise, MetroWorks does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested or under the following circumstances:

  * We may provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with MetroWorks under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help MetroWorks communicate to you offers from MetroWorks and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * Where we are required by law, such as in a criminal or civil investigation or other legal proceedings, to divulge such information to the authorities.
  * Where there may be suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or other violations of MetroWorks's terms of use.
  * If there is a merger or takeover by another company of MetroWorks, then we may transfer customer information to the acquirer. In this event, MetroWorks will notify you before information about you is transferred, but only if the terms of the acquirer's privacy policy are different to ours.
