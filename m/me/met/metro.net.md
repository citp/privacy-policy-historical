# Site Information | Privacy Policy

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Authority (Metro) respects your privacy. The following describes our Privacy Policy in relation to the information you submit via metro.net, and how it is used.

### About Nextrip

Nextrip is a service designed to help take the guesswork out of bus and rail arrivals and help you to get to your stop at the same time as your bus or train. Nextrip uses satellite technology to find the specific location of a bus or train; then sends the estimated arrival time to a particular stop via cell phone, website or other mobile device.

Nextrip uses Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology and advanced computer modeling to track buses and trains on their routes. Taking into account the actual position of the transit vehicles, their intended stops, and the typical traffic patterns, Nextrip predicts arrivals with a high degree of accuracy. Estimates are updated constantly as vehicles are tracked.

### 'Go Metro' Mobile App

The application uses your precise current location via GPS (global positioning system) or other network location sources like Wi-Fi and cell towers. In order to use these location services they must be turned on and available to your device. Location data provided by any external services (such as Google Maps or the Metro Trip Planner) is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed. Neither Metro, nor its agents, nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any external services.

Metro does not collect nor store personal information from customers downloading, installing or using our 'Go Metro' mobile applications for iPhone, iPad, or Android. Customers who want to provide feedback via the 'Report A Bug' button in the application have the option to provide contact information ONLY if they'd like a reply. Device model and current operating system is collected for troubleshooting, this response is sent by email.

In the event the application crashes, a ‘crash log file’ is automatically generated and sent to Go Metro’s cloud server. Device model, current system version, time of crash, and crash report (a text file which consists of errors/exceptions logs on what cause the app crashed) is collected for troubleshooting - no personal information is collected or sent to Go Metro cloud servers.

Event tracking is utilized to provide information for the My Metro feature and to support improved future application design. Various buttons, links, and actions are logged and sent to [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) server to determine feature usage, content usage, and app behavior. If a data connection is not available, data is temporarily stored on device until a data connection is established, at which point, data is sent to Google Analytics servers - no personal information is collected or sent to Google Analytics.
