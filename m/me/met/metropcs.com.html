<h1>Privacy Policy</h1> 

<p>MetroPCS Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “MetroPCS”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) understands that your privacy is important, and we have adopted this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to describe what information may be collected about you by us when you access or use our website or our service, as well as any electronic transmission sent, received, posted, accessed or stored via our network (collectively, the “Service”). This Policy also describes how that information may be used or disclosed by us. This Policy does not apply to information about you that may be collected offline by us. </p>
<p>MetroPCS will revise and update this Policy from time to time, if required by law or as a result of a change in our privacy practices and any information collected or shared by you after the date of such change in policy will be subject to such changed policy. We assume no obligations to inform you of any changes and therefore you should refer to this page for the most up-to-date information. </p>

<h3>Personal Information</h3> 
<p>“Personal Information” includes your name, address or credit card, PIN, birth date, email address or telephone number as well as other information that you may provide to us through your use of the Service. Personal Information also includes customer proprietary network information “CPNI,” which relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of your use of the Service. Personal Information does not include aggregate customer data (collective data about our customers from which customer names or other identifiers have been removed) or customer list information. </p>

<h3>How Collected</h3> 
<p>Personal Information is collected when you purchase our products or services online or otherwise interact with us online, for example when you visit our website, complete an online customer satisfaction survey, correspond with us, or submit a resume electronically. Personal Information about you may also be provided to us by third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies, vendors, dealers or application service providers. </p>
<p>We may also collect or purchase certain publicly available Personal Information such as names, postal addresses and phone numbers from third parties for marketing purposes. (You should always check the privacy policies of other service providers to ensure you understand your privacy choices before subscribing to or purchasing any service.) </p>
<p>CPNI, as defined above, is collected solely by virtue of your customer relationship with us and your use of our network for wireless web access and voice and data services. </p>

<h3>How Used</h3> 
<p>MetroPCS will not use or disclose Personal Information, other than as set forth herein or as described in our customer service agreements with you. </p>
<p>We may collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information for the following reasons: with your consent; 
</p><ul>
    <li>to provide you access to the Service or to initiate, render, bill or collect for our products and services or to complete a transaction;</li>
    <li>to market or provide phones, related equipment, additional services, or information services to you; </li>
    <li>to provide services necessary to, or used in, the provision of our services, including the publishing of directories; </li>
    <li>to protect our rights or property or to protect customers or other telecommunications carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, our services;</li>
    <li>to provide information regarding products or services, referrals, or administrative services to you when you contact us and approve of our use of the information during the course of the call; </li>
    <li>to enforce or apply our service agreements with you; <br>and</li>
    <li>to provide call location information about wireless subscribers in emergency situations; </li>
    <li>to comply with governmental laws, regulations and orders (including subpoenas relating to personal or private electronic communications transmitted on our networks and/or other information about our business or our subscribers) and to cooperate with governmental investigations.</li>
</ul>
 
<p></p>

<p>MetroPCS is constantly striving to enhance the quality and selection of the products and services that we offer to you as our customer. As a result, we may also share information, including Personal Information, about you with others such as retailers and direct marketers that we select in an effort to make you aware of additional products and services that may be of interest to you. Unless you change your communications preferences or opt out as set forth below, we may contact you for marketing purposes via phone, email, text message, picture message, auto dialer, fax or direct mailing or otherwise via our website. </p>
<p>From time to time you may be able to participate in contests, giveaways or other promotions. All Personal Information you provide will be used in accordance with this Policy except as otherwise set forth in such promotions. In addition, from time to time we may request users to participate in customer satisfaction surveys. These surveys are voluntary. Any Personal Information you provide in connection with these surveys will be used for our internal business purposes for improving the use and satisfaction of our products and services, our website and our network. </p>
<p>Information about our users, including Personal Information, may also be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. </p>
<p>Upon your request, MetroPCS may disclose your Personal Information to an individual designated by you. </p>
<p>In addition, MetroPCS may create and share aggregate data about our customers. </p>
<p><strong>Your Rights</strong> Collection, use, disclosure, and protection of Personal Information may be subject to different regulation outside the United States. </p>
<p>You are not required to participate in promotional activities or survey questionnaires, and you have the right to opt out of our use and sharing of your Personal Information for marketing purposes. You may change your preferences for marketing communications or choose to be added to our do not call or do not email lists by contacting our privacy office as listed below. If, however, you choose to opt out of receiving marketing communications, it will make it more difficult for us to offer you products and services tailored to your needs and may prevent you from receiving offers beneficial to you which require use of your Personal Information. </p>
<p>Should you choose to do so, you can opt-out of receiving third party marketing communications and direct us at any time: </p>
<ul>
    <li>not to use Personal Information to inform you of product and service offers from thirdparties that we believe would be of interest to you; and/or </li>
    <li>not to provide Personal Information about you to non-affiliated third-parties for marketing purposes,</li>
</ul>

<p>by writing to: MetroPCS, P.O. Box 601119, Dallas, Texas, 75360-1119, Attention: Privacy Office. Your request to opt out of disclosure of such information will continue to apply until you notify us that you would like to revoke or limit it. Your decision to opt out will not affect our provision of Service to you. And, you will continue to receive invoices, customer service-related notifications, technical or network-related notifications, MetroPCS product and service offers (including those related to your Service, phones, information services, or related equipment) that we believe would be of interest to you, and information from us related to the Service electronically or otherwise. </p>

<h3>Additional Rights Regarding CPNI</h3> 
<p>MetroPCS does not disclose CPNI without your consent or direction, except to affiliates, agents and joint venture partners who provide you with communications-related services and who are bound by confidentiality agreements with us, or as required or allowed by law and to third parties who we may use to provide customer service, billing, or other services to you and who are bound by confidentiality agreements with us. Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of information about your telephone usage, the services you buy from us, who you call, and the location of your device on our network when you make a voice call. Before sharing CPNI in a way other than as described in this Policy, we will notify you of your rights under the law, describe how we intend to use the CPNI, and give you an opportunity to opt out of such usage (or, when required by law, to opt in). Denial of approval regarding uses and disclosures of your CPNI will not affect the Services to which you have subscribed. </p>

<h3>Location and Tracking Information</h3> 
<p>As an integral part of enabling wireless communications, information regarding the general location of your phone or wireless device is collected and used by the MetroPCS network. Your wireless device sends out periodic signals to the nearest radio tower/cell site providing information, including information regarding the location within the network, which allows the network to properly route an incoming call or message. This network location information derived from providing our Service, in addition to being covered by this Policy, is CPNI and is protected as described above. </p>
<p>However, if you dial 911 for emergency services, we are required by Federal Communications Commission regulations to provide your network location to a public safety answering point (PSAP), emergency medical service provider or emergency dispatch provider, public safety, fire service, or law enforcement official, or hospital emergency or trauma care facility. The law also permits us to disclose the location of a device on our network without a user’s consent (1) to a user’s legal guardian or members of a user’s immediate family in an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or serious physical harm, (2) to database management services or information providers solely to assist in delivering emergency services, or (3) to a governmental entity if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of a device’s location on the network without delay. </p>

<h3>Website Terms</h3> 
<p>When you visit our website to learn more about MetroPCS products and services, access your account, pay your bill, or submit other information to us, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address and the page you request. We use this information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our services, to contact you, to conduct research, and to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. </p>
<p>We may also set and access MetroPCS cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. This data identifies your computer and records the web pages you visit so that when you return the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. </p>

<p>MetroPCS uses cookies for a number of purposes, including to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>access your information when you "sign in," so that we can provide you with customized content; </li>
    <li>keep track of preferences you specify while you are accessing our web site;</li>
    <li>estimate and report our total audience size and traffic; </li>
    <li>conduct research to improve MetroPCS’s products and services; and/or </li>
    <li>require you to re-enter your password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to access or order certain MetroPCS products and services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. </p>
<p>Advertisers that serve ads on our site may also use their own cookies. Such outside cookies are governed by the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads, and are not subject to this Policy. MetroPCS may also place advertisements about our products and services on other websites. These companies may use cookies and other technology such as web beacons or tagging to measure the effectiveness of our ads. The use of such cookies is also subject to the privacy practices of the ad serving companies, not this Policy. </p>
<p>In addition, should you take advantage of service and products offered by other companies, or visit or interact with other websites utilizing our wireless service, you may be providing Personal Information to those companies. Any information about you received by those third parties will be governed by their privacy policies, not this Policy. MetroPCS is not responsible for any links posted to our website or any information you provide as a result of clicking on such links. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. </p>

<h3>Children’s Online Privacy</h3> 
<p>MetroPCS understands that parents often purchase our products and services for family use, including for use by minors. The website is for use by individuals 13 years of age or older. We will not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. Individuals under 13 years of age are not permitted to use the website or even submit their personal information at our Website. You understand and agree that since our products may be used by children under 13 without our knowledge, any information collected will appear to be the information of the adult subscriber and treated as such under this Policy. If a child informs us that he or she is under the age of 13, we will ask a parent to confirm his/her consent in advance of further collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information from that child. IF A PARENT OR GUARDIAN BECOMES AWARE OF ACCESS TO THE SERVICE BY A MINOR, PLEASE WRITE TO US AT THE ADDRESS BELOW SO WE MAY DELETE INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH UNDERAGE PERSON FROM OUR ELECTRONIC RECORDS. MetroPCS encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children. </p>

<h3>No Guarantee of Security</h3> 
<p>At this time, we do not utilize encryption technology or maintain other protections to ensure your Personal Information is secure while in our possession. It is your responsibility to keep your user name, password or other access information safe and confidential to protect against unauthorized access to your account information. </p>
<p>MetroPCS makes no representation or warranties about the security of its wireless Web access services or that your use will be error-free, uninterrupted, or free of infection by viruses or other malicious codes or acts of third parties beyond our control. In addition, MetroPCS has no control over the security of other sites on the Internet you might visit or from which you might purchase products or services. </p>

<h3>Security Measures You Can Implement</h3> 
<p>It is important to also maintain control over your password and PIN to prevent unauthorized access to your wireless device, your service account and your voicemail. If you write your password and PIN down, keep it in a secure location. You should also change your password and PIN periodically. Do not give your password and PIN to someone else unless you intend them to have the same full access and ability to make changes to your account. </p>

<h3>Third Party Solicitations</h3> 
<p>Not all advertisements appearing on your mobile phone or device may be authorized by MetroPCS. We take steps to reduce unsolicited bulk messages, but we cannot block all unsolicited wireless advertising. </p>
<p>In addition, please note that it is unlawful for any third party to make an unsolicited telemarketing call using an autodialer or to send a prerecorded message to a wireless phone or device. You should report any unsolicited calls to the Federal Communications Commission. </p>

<h3>Consumer Protection Notice</h3> 
<p>If anyone calls you soliciting a “too good to be true offer,” simply hangup and contact the MetroPCS Customer Service (888-863-8768) to validate the promotion. Do not give out your credit card information, PIN, password, bank information, or other personal information over the phone or via email unless you are the one who initiated contact with MetroPCS and are confident such disclosure is being made to an authorized representative of MetroPCS. Be sure to type anytime you wish to access our site. Do not rely on links contained in an unsolicited email or provide Personal Information as a result of clicking on any links contained in an unsolicited email. </p>

<h3>Record Retention</h3> 
<p>MetroPCS retains all of the information it collects under this Policy for as long as there is a business need for such information. </p>

<h3>Policy Updates</h3> 
<p>As stated above, we may update or change this Policy if our practices change or if the law requires changes to this Policy. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Policy at any time. All Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Website. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the website and/or Service following the posting of changes to this Policy will mean that you accept such changes. </p>
