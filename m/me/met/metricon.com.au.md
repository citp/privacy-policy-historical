Metricon may also collect information from you if you provide products and/or services to Metricon ( **Service Provider Channels** ), and this personal information is generally collected to assist obtaining the products and/or services from you.

####  What personal information does Metricon collect?

Metricon collects the types of personal information required to assist with providing Metricon’s products and services and informing you about them.

This includes, through the Collection Channels, personal information such as your name, date of birth, phone number, email and home addresses and information to assist with Metricon’s customer relationship management and market research functions, which may include information relating to your interests, experiences and preferences.

Through Service Provider Channels, Metricon may collect information about your employment or trading history and any business, company or related entity you are involved with.

####  How does Metricon use your personal information? To whom will it be disclosed?

Metricon may use your personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected, i.e. the purpose specified in a privacy collection statement through a particular Collection Channel or Service Provider Channel or the purpose that could be reasonably expected at the time the information was collected. Metricon may also use your personal information for a secondary related purpose.

By submitting your personal information, you consent to Metricon using it to:

a) provide you with products or services;

b) complete an activity that you have chosen to undertake;

c) administer Metricon’s relationship with you;

d) monitor online activity on the Metricon website(s) and/or application(s);

e) market, improve and add to Metricon’s products and services (including online);

a) to third parties engaged by Metricon to provide services, including IT services such as storing and managing databases, processing credit card information, mail outs, debt collection, marketing research and advertising; and

b) to third parties authorised by you to receive personal information held by us.

####  Can you remain anonymous or withhold personal information?

Yes. Where practical, you may choose not to identify yourself, deal with us on an anonymous basis or use a pseudonym.

In some instances, if you do not provide Metricon with required personal information Metricon may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service, allow you to participate in promotion activities or obtain the product or service you are offering.

As a result, Metricon may need to cease existing sales processes, suspend, cancel or renew a contract (subject to its terms and conditions and relevant laws), withdraw an invitation or offer or decline your entry into a competition.

####  Will you receive direct marketing?

If you provide us with your personal information and you consent to receiving direct marketing communications from Metricon, you authorise us to send you promotional messages and materials related to Metricon’s products and services, unless you submit a later request not to receive direct marketing communications.

Metricon’s direct marketing messages and materials will contain a prominent statement (including, for electronic messages, a functional unsubscribe facility) that you may request not to receive direct marketing communications.

####  Will your information be disclosed overseas?

Metricon is unlikely to disclose your personal information to any person or entity outside Australia, but will inform you if and when this is necessary.

####  How can you access and correct your personal information?

You generally have the right to access your personal information free of charge, subject to some limitations contained in the Privacy Act 1988.

The APPs set out some circumstances in which Metricon is not required to provide you with such access. If you ask for your personal information and any of these circumstances exist, you may be given access to the personal information in a way that is permitted under the Privacy Act 1988.

To protect personal information held by Metricon, you may need to confirm your identity before access to your personal information is granted. It may take a little time to process your application for access and retrieve information from storage (if applicable).

Metricon encourages you to update us so that Metricon has accurate, current and complete information. You may correct any errors or request that Metricon deletes all or some of your personal information. You may also submit a request not to have any further contact from us.

####  Does Metricon use 'cookies'?

Yes. When you use Metricon’s website(s) and/or App(s), Metricon or its IT service providers may obtain information using technologies such as cookies, tags, web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) to better understand your user experience.

This information is generally not linked to your identity, except where it is accessed via links in Metricon e-message or where you have identified yourself. Metricon may use knowledge of your user experience to better understand what products or services may be of interest to you.
