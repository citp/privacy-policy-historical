        MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) is dedicated to helping protect you and those 
        you love. Part of that protection includes safeguarding personal information 
        about you that you have provided to us. MetLife's information practices 
        for this website are outlined below.</p>

<p><span class="verbold">Your Personal Information:</span><br>
        When you come to a MetLife website, we log your current Internet address 
        (this is usually a temporary address assigned by your Internet service 
        provider when you sign in), the type of operating system you are using, 
        and the type of browser software used. In addition, we may keep track 
        of what portions of the website you are visiting. We aggregate this information 
        to help us create a better experience for users of our website. For example: 
        we may upgrade those parts of the website that are heavily visited or 
        optimize the website to work more efficiently with certain operating systems. 
      </p>

      <p>If you do choose to provide us with personal information, you can be 
        assured that all information that you provide to us is kept in secure 
        databases. MetLife treats this information as confidential. However, we 
        may use this information for administrative and marketing purposes, and 
        the information may be shared with our affiliates and, in some instances, 
        unaffiliated third parties. For example, we may contact you to make you 
        aware of MetLife products and/or services offered by MetLife, or its affiliates, 
        which we feel may be of interest to you. We may disclose information to 
        affiliates or unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of performing 
        business services for us or as otherwise permitted by law. We will not 
        sell or otherwise make available personal information about you to unaffiliated 
        third parties for marketing purposes, except as permitted or required 
        by law. You may contact us at the addresses listed below in order to tell 
        us not to share your personal information with our affiliates or unaffiliated 
        third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

<p><span class="verbold">Cookies:</span><br>
        A cookie is a small piece of information that a website sends to your 
        computer, which is stored in a file on your hard drive. The next time 
        you visit our website, we may use the information stored in the cookie 
        file to facilitate your use of our website. For example, we may use the 
        cookie file to store a password so that you do not have to continually 
        input it every time you move to a different section of a password-protected 
        portion of our website. A cookie does not tell us your individual identity 
        unless you have chosen to provide it to us. Most cookies expire after 
        a defined period of time, or you can delete your cookie file at any time 
        you choose. In addition, you can set your browser to notify you when you 
        receive a cookie so that you can decide whether to accept or reject it.</p>

<p><span class="verbold">Privacy and E-Mail:</span><br>
        Not every website takes steps to safeguard the privacy of your information. 
        In particular, if you need to send confidential information and are unsure 
        about the security of a website, then you should consider sending it by 
        phone or by regular mail instead. E-mail on the Internet is not secure 
        unless you are using a secure e-mail program. If any organization or individual 
        asks you for confidential information (your Social Security Number or 
        a bank or credit card account number, for example), you should check to 
        see if the information being transmitted is encrypted in order to ensure 
        the security of your information. You can check to see whether your information 
        is encrypted by checking the bottom line of your browser window. If a 
        broken key or open lock is displayed, then the information is not being 
        scrambled (or encrypted) when it is sent over the Internet. If the key 
        or lock is broken or open, then the information being transmitted is not 
        encrypted and it is possible for it to be intercepted and read by an unauthorized 
        party.</p>

<p><span class="verbold">Minors:</span><br>
        At the MetLife websites, we make no active effort to collect personal 
        information from children under the age of 18. We believe that children 
        who do wish to submit information to MetLife should have permission from 
        their parent or legal guardian, and we encourage you to participate in 
        your child's exploration of the Internet.</p>
