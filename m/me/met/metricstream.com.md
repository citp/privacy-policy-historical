**Law Enforcement**

Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your information to government or law enforcement officials in response to a lawful request by a public authority or if we have to do so to comply with a legal obligation, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We can also disclose your information in order to apply or enforce our terms and conditions or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent or prevent any illegal activity (including for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).

You will be notified when any identifying information about you is collected or shared by any third party that is not our service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether to share your information with that party. If you do not wish to have your information shared and want to opt out from receiving further communications from any third party that is not our agent or service provider, please contact that third party directly.

Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority at MetricStream. MetricStream has taken appropriate measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of your information (including as required by the Privacy Shield (described below). Once MetricStream receives information that is entered into its Web site, it is stored behind a firewall. All MetricStream employees are aware of the company's privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.

**Privacy Shield - EU - US Data Transfers  **

If you are located inside the EU and provide personal data to us, MetricStream may transfer your personal data to the United States with your prior permission and process it in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**Our Obligations to you under the Privacy Shield**

MetricStream complies with the EU-U.S Privacy Shield Framework (“ **Privacy Shield** ”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information MetricStream may receive from European Union member countries.

MetricStream has certified that it adheres to the following Privacy Shield Principles of (1) Notice; (2) Choice; (3) Accountability for Onward Transfer; (4) Security; (5) Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; (6) Access; and (7) Recourse, Enforcement and Liability in respect of any personal data received from the European Union.

If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall take priority. 

To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page on the Privacy Shield List, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>

**Accountability and Liability for Onward Transfer**

MetricStream is required to take certain steps when transferring personal data received from the European Union to third parties (such as including contractual provisions in our third party contracts which require them to provide the same level of protection the Privacy Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf).

We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third parties process personal data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to stop and remediate any unauthorised processing.

Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of third parties who perform services on our behalf in connection with their handling of personal data that we transfer to them (including where we transfer personal data to them pursuant to the Privacy Shield).

**Privacy Complaints Handling, Recourse and Enforcement**

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, MetricStream commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information (without charge to you). European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us at:

[privacypolicy@metricstream.com](mailto:privacypolicy@metricstream.com)

We will respond to any complaints as soon as possible and within 45 days.

You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority and we will work with them to resolve your concerns.

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, in certain limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available provided that you have taken the following steps: (1) raised your compliant directly to us using the contact details above and provided us the opportunity to resolve the issue; and (2) raised the issue through the relevant data protection authority and allowed the U.S Department of Commerce an opportunity to resolve the complaint at no cost to you. For further information on your option to select binding arbitration see Annex I of the Privacy Shield Principles located at: <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction>.

MetricStream is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission in the case of any failure to comply with the Privacy Shield.

**Access to information**

You have the right to access the personal data we collect about you in the EEA and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield. These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where we must comply with legal requirements or if providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access.

If you would like to request access to, correction, or deletion of your personal data collected in the EEA, you can submit a written request using the contact information provided below. We may request specific information from you in order to confirm your identity. In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information.

**Processing information for our enterprise customers:**

Where we process personal information in connection with the provision of our software solutions to our enterprise customers, we only collect, process and store personal information to support and provide those solutions. We act as data processors on behalf of our customers and do not use such information for our own purposes. You should refer to the agreements governing your use of those solutions with such enterprises to find out more about how your data is being used by them.

You should check this part of MetricStream' Web periodically to determine if there has been a change. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
