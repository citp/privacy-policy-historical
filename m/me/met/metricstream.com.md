MetricStream is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains MetricStream’ data collection and use practices. However, this policy does not apply to any of MetricStream’ products or services. 

**Collection and Use of Information**  
Parts of this site may invite you to register for events, download white papers or literature, or obtain more information. MetricStream collects the email addresses of those who communicate via email, as well as information volunteered by consumers, such as in information requests and/or site registrations. Under no circumstances will any information provided to MetricStream be sold or rented to a third party. MetricStream may use your contact information to send you company and product information that you requested, and for marketing analysis of MetricStream’ Web site traffic. 

This site may use technology that lets MetricStream collect certain technical information, such as IP addresses, browser types, traffic patterns and the address of any referring Web sites, and uses HTTP cookies for systems administration. However, if you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your Web browser to do so, if your browser so permits. 

MetricStream may monitor how a visitor arrives at the Web site, but cannot and will not gather information about other sites you have been on. MetricStream does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. 

**Use of Personal Information**  
MetricStream may use your personal information for the following purposes: 

  * To make the site easier for you to use by entering your personal information only once 
  * To provide information to allow MetricStream to create and publish content most relevant to its customers 
  * To alert its customers to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services 



You may remove your name from any MetricStream’ distribution list by clicking on a link provided within each electronic communication, or by replying to the email with the subject line “unsubscribe”. 

If you supply MetricStream with your telephone number online, you may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such telephone calls, please let us know by calling the telephone number below. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
MetricStream’ website may provide links that can take you to other Web sites, which may include MetricStream’ partner Web sites. You should review the privacy and other policies at third party sites you visit, since those sites are not bound by MetricStream’ privacy policy, and MetricStream has no control over the content of these other sites, nor the usage of information they gather. 

**Security**  
Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority at MetricStream. MetricStream has taken careful measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of your information. Once MetricStream receives information that is entered into its Web site, it is stored behind a firewall. All MetricStream employees are aware of the company’s privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs. 

**Modifications  
**MetricStream may, in its discretion, alter or add to this Privacy Policy. You should check this part of MetricStream’ Web periodically to determine if there has been a change. 

**General
