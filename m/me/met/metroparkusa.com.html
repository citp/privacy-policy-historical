			<h3>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>When you register for the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services, you will be asked to provide certain personal information that will be stored in your "profile." The profile contains various personal information which may include, but not be limited to, the following: (1) e-mail address, (2) first and last name, (3) country, (4) state or territory and (5) ZIP code. In addition to the information in your profile, the Metropark online store Web site and Clique may also collect and store the IP address of your computer or other networking device, which may be needed to operate various features of the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services. We may also collect data pertaining to your online transactions, purchase history, and Web site usage patterns. When you register for the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services, you may be asked to create a password for your account. You may also be requested to provide secret questions and secret answers. You use your secret questions and answers to help verify your identity to Clique when there are account issues, such as needing to reset your password.</p>
			
			<h3>USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>Metropark and Clique will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.  Metropark and Clique will not use or share your personal information in a manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your prior consent. Metropark and Clique use your personal information for the operation and maintenance of your Metropark online store Web site and Clique account and the Clique Services. For example, we use your e-mail address to send you a welcome e-mail message when you first sign up on the mailing list. You must respond to this e-mail in order to validate that you are the owner of the e-mail address associated with the Metropark online store Web site and Clique account. Failure to respond to the e-mail and verify the address within the time stated in the email will cause the Metropark online store Web site and Clique account to become inactive. This process is designed to verify the validity of the e-mail address and to help prevent e-mail addresses from being used without permission in the creation of Metropark online store Web site and Clique accounts. As part of the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services, we may recommend for your consideration various products and merchandise. Accordingly, we may analyze data pertaining to your online transactions, purchase history, and Web site usage patterns on Web sites so that we can make recommendations suited especially to you. We may also send you periodic e-mails about special events or exclusive offers.</p>
			
			<h3>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
			<p>Metropark and Clique will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. Beginning January 1, 2005, under California's "Shine the Light" law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2007 will receive information regarding 2006 sharing activities).</p>
			<p>To obtain this information, please send an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:info@metroparkusa.com">info@metroparkusa.com</a> with "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your e-mail address in response. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.</p>
			
			<h3>GENERAL DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>Metropark and Clique may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as answering customer support inquiries. Metropark and Clique will only provide these companies with those pieces of your personal information needed to deliver the services, and the companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose. Metropark and Clique may share your personal information with third parties in order to fulfill a service or transaction you may have requested. Metropark and Clique may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on Metropark and Clique; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Metropark and Clique; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Metropark online store web site and Clique Service, or the public.</p>
			
			<h3>MANAGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>You can always add, update, or make other changes to the information in your Metropark online store Web site profile.</p>
			
			<h3>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>If you choose, you may opt-in to various features which may be available as part of the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services which allow the voluntary sharing of information between you and a group of Metropark online store Web site and Clique users designated by you (i.e. a wish list). In this way, the Metropark online store Web Site and Clique users who are listed on each other's wish list can view information about one another's online transactions and other types of information; for example what merchandise is being purchased by the members of the wish list.</p>
			
			<h3>SECURITY AND STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>Metropark and Clique are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. You must type the correct password to access your information. It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your Metropark online store Web site and Clique account password and not to reveal this information to others. Personal information collected by Metropark and Clique may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Clique or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents maintain facilities. By using the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
			
			<h3>OPERATIONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>Some "operational" information is used by the Clique Services in order to operate your account properly and provide the services you have requested. This operational information does not include the personal information that you provide as part of your Clique profile, but may include, for example, the following: the date on which your Metropark online store Web site profile was last updated, whether your e-mail address has been verified, whether your account has been deactivated, what browser you are using, the IP address of your computer or other networking device, and other similar types of information. Operational information may be shared with third parties to the extent necessary to provide Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services.</p>
			
			<h3>AGGREGATE INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>We may collect and analyze information about your use of the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services as aggregated with the use of the Clique Services by other users ("Aggregate Information"); for example, overall usage patterns of Metropark online store Web site and Clique users, the total number of Metropark online store Web site and Clique users, the percentage of Metropark online store Web site and Clique users who are female, or in a certain age range, or who live in a particular region, etc., or the percentage of Metropark online store Web site and Clique users who are also consumers of various other products and services. The collection and analysis of Aggregate Information is important in the operation and enhancement of the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services and other business purposes. Aggregate Information may be compiled in reports and disclosed, sold, licensed or rented to third parties. However, since Aggregate Information does not include any information which can be used to individually identify you or any other Metropark online store Web site and Clique user, it is not possible for the third party recipient of the Aggregate Information to use it to identify or contact you.</p>
			
			<h3>USE OF COOKIES</h3>
			<p>A cookie is a very small text file that a Web site saves to your computer's hard disk to store information that you provide about yourself or to store your preferences. The Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services may use cookies when you sign in to the Metropark online store Web site. The Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services store your unique identifier, the time you signed in, and Metropark online store Web site and Clique profile information in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. The cookie allows you to move from page to page at the participating site without having to sign in again on each page. The Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services may also use cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services may store your user name in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your user name to be entered automatically, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies using the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use the Metropark online store Web site and Clique Services.</p>
