**Our Commitment to Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us and Metra is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust. For that reason, we have established this Privacy Policy. Any personal information provided by customers/visitors to the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad (Metra) Website is used for internal purposes only. Metra does not plan to divulge, sell or lease any personal information, customer listings, or aggregate data gathered through the Metra site to any outside party.

**Information Collected and How We Use It**  
We collect two types of information about visitors:

**Personal information** , which you have voluntarily submitted to us through Metra direct mail programs or Ticket-By-Internet.

**Aggregate information** , automatically collected non-identifying statistics, (such as information about how many visitors log on to our sites, the pages they access, etc.) Our web servers collect the IP addresses of visitors, not the e-mail addresses. Metra uses this information to measure the use of our site, to improve the content of our site, and to monitor access for security purposes.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Metra provides links to a number of third-party external sites. The inclusion of any link does not imply Metra endorsement of the external site company, its website, or the services it promotes or sells. When you leave the Metra site to visit one of these linked sites, the only information transferred to the third party is the fact that you came from metrarail.com (the "refer address"). 

Metra is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of these third party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at these sites to determine how your information may be used.

**Children's Privacy**   
While we do not direct any of the information on our site specifically to children, we believe that protecting the privacy of children is important, and for that reason it is our intention to never collect or maintain information at our website from children. 

**Contact Us**   
Should you have other questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the [Webmaster@metrarail.com](mailto:Webmaster@metrarail.com)
