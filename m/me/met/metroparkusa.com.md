This may take from a couple of days to several weeks. 

We are able to ship to countries other than those listed above. Such orders cannot be processed on line, but you may email, fax or phone in your order.

If you exchange an item, you will be responsible for shipping charges that apply to the reshipment of the item. 

###  Customs Duties and Other Fees

Please note that shipping charges do not include taxes or duty. The customer is solely responsible for any customs, duties, foreign taxes or other fees that his/her country may impose to take delivery of his/her order. In order to comply with export regulations, we are required by U.S. law to declare the exact value of all items ordered and to mark them as dutiable "merchandise." Declaring less than the true value is both a violation of American law and the laws of most other countries. In addition, we could lose the right to export to your country should it ever be discovered that we were misrepresenting the value. Because we are a retailer, we are prohibited by law from marking your order as "gift," even if the order is intended as a gift by its recipient. Call your local customs office for details about these charges. 

##  Returns

If you are not satisfied with your online purchase, please follow our guidelines for returns: 

  * All returns require a Return Authorization (RA) number (see instructions below).
  * All returns must be postmarked within 30 days of receipt. Returns sent after this time will not be honored.
  * The merchandise must be in its original condition and unworn.
  * We do not refund shipping charges.
  * We do not accept returns/exchanges on custom-made or special order items, undergarments, or sale merchandise. These types of sales are final.
  * We are not responsible for damages that occur during care of an item, such as dry cleaning, washing or wear.



Please be advised that items that do not conform to the above guidelines are not returnable. They will be returned to you at your expense. 

###  Damaged/Incorrect Items
