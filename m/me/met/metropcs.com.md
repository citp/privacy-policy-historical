MetroPCS understands that your privacy is important, and we have adopted this privacy policy to inform you of the steps we take to protect information about your use of our Service. In offering and providing Service to you, we collect certain information relating to your use of our Service ("Customer Service Information"). Customer Service Information consists of: information contained in bills that we send to you relating to Service; information regarding your payment history with us; and information that is available to us solely by virtue of your customer relationship with us relating to the quantity, type, technical configuration, destination, and amount of your use of Service. Under federal law, you have a right to the protection of, and we have a duty to protect, the confidentiality of Customer Service Information. We protect the privacy of our wireless customers consistent with the applicable federal laws. 

We may use or disclose Customer Service Information that we collect about you as permitted by law. For example, we may use or disclose Customer Service Information about you:
