<h2>Privacy Statement for <a href="/" target="main" onclick="linkandclose();">Metrodate.com</a></h2>
<i>Last Updated: March 20, 2009</i><br><br>
<p>Metrodate.com takes member privacy very seriously. We use all reasonable efforts to protect our members' information. The purpose of this policy is to help our members recognize our firm commitment to their privacy, while having a complete understanding of how their information is used by our service.
</p><p>Our policy may change at any time. Members are encouraged to review it regularly, and contact us with any questions. We tried to address all major concerns regarding privacy in this document, written in a non-legalese format that is hopefully easy to understand. By using Metrodate.com, you are agreeing to these policies.
</p><h2>Children</h2>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old to use Metrodate.com.
</p><h2>Your E-Mail Address and Spam</h2>
<p>Metrodate.com never shares or sells our members' e-mail addresses to anybody else. By providing your e-mail address to Metrodate.com, you will only receive correspondence from us, no one else. We send occasional newsletters and alerts, such as when you receive a message from another member. If you no longer wish to receive e-mail from us, simply freeze your account at any time from the Account Info page. You will not start receiving any spam by signing up for our service.
</p><p>Many other singles sites will send your actual e-mail address to another person if you contact another member, or respond to a message they sent to you. This doesn't give you a chance to correspond with each other first before deciding if you want to give them your e-mail address.
</p><h2>Your Identity to Other Members</h2>
<p>Only you can give another member your true name or contact information. Even your e-mail address is kept completely private from other members. Our online messaging system allows you to correspond with other members without giving away your actual e-mail address. It is up to you when you are comfortable in giving someone your private information. Just like in conventional pickup settings such as bars, we encourage our members to take all precautions when meeting other members, or providing any private information.
</p><h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>In order for a web site to be truly interactive, sessions are usually required. For example, once you log on to the site, a user can go from page to page while the site "remembers" who you are until you log off. Cookies make this possible.
</p><p>Disabling cookies on your browser will mean you will not be able to utilize Metrodate.com, because you won't be able to log on.
</p><p>We also save other information as cookies to speed up the web site and add other features for you. For example, there is a cookie to remember your user id so that the next time you visit the site you don't have to retype it.
</p><h2>Information Provided by Our Members</h2>
<p>Member profiles are the heart of our service, which of course is built on information provided by our members about themselves. Information provided by our members is either considered private or public.
</p><p>Private information is not shared with anybody for any reason. Private information is not available to other members. In addition, we do not sell private information to third parties.
Private information includes the member's real name, birth date, e-mail address, street address, and any payment information.
</p><p>Public information may be posted on the web site and includes the user's user id (nick name or alias), city, state, country, age, photo, voice message, questionnaire answers, any posted messages, and more.
</p><p>Public profiles may also be used in personal ads that are printed in various publications we partner with in your area.
We only reprint the public portion of your profile (For example user id, age, and public message).
Of course, private information such as your real name and e-mail address are not printed.
You can opt out of being printed in these publications by letting us know.
</p><p>It may be possible for members to post information in public areas that we would usually classify as private. For example, a user may put his/her real name in their message. We generally discourage this for the privacy of our members.
</p><h2>Information Automatically Collected by Traffic and Event Logs</h2>
<p>Like most web sites, our traffic logs record your IP address, the web site you clicked over from, your web browser version, the date and time, and all pages you visited on the site. This information is used to help us with our marketing efforts and make improvements to the web site.
</p><p>We also log various events such as each time a user logs in and performs certain actions on the web site, such as placing orders or participating in various promotions. This information is used to help us support our members.
</p><h2>Information Provided to Third Parties</h2>
<p>Metrodate.com utilizes monitoring tools including Google Analytics for traffic reporting.
Third party tools are also used for displaying advertising on Metrodate.com, including Google AdSense and Google Ad Manager.
These systems require sending various traffic information to these third parties, in order to get detailed traffic reports, to learn from site usage, and to show targeted advertising to visitors.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Private Information to Government Authorities</h2>
<p>Under various circumstances, it may be necessary for Metrodate.com to disclose private information about our members to government agencies such as law enforcement. In addition, we may report Metrodate users to the authorities in the case of legal wrongdoing, such as attempting to use a stolen credit card.
</p><h2>Security Measures</h2>
<p>All reasonable efforts are utilized to secure our members' private information. All financial transactions are encrypted using SSL security, the industry standard for secure web site transactions. In addition, we have measures in place to detect scams common to singles sites. (If someone says you can get millions of dollars for helping them out, it's not true!)
</p><h2>Background Checks</h2>
<p>Metrodate does <b>not</b> do background checks on our members.
When you meet people in the real world, like in a bar, club, or at the gym, no one is doing a background check there either.
Also, members are fully responsible for the information contained in their profiles and messages.
We can not attest for the accuracy of what hundreds of thousands of members write about themselves.
So when you are meeting someone, whether from Metrodate.com, or anywhere else, please take all necessary precautions.
</p><h2>Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>At any time our members can update their member information by visiting the various sections under "My Profile" menu such as the "About Me" page. Location and more personal information is available form the "Account Info" page under the Home menu.
We encourage our members to review their own profile to see what information is being provided to other members.
If users wish to cancel service, they can do so at any time by going to "Account Info" from the "Home" menu.
