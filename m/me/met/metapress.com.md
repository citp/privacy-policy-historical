Metapress wants you to have a positive experience at this website. We want you to
know that we respect the privacy and security of our users. Our goal is to provide you
with an experience that delivers the information and resources that are helpful to you. In
order to achieve this goal, we collect information from you. We discuss our information
collection practices below.
This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy practices in effect at the Metapress website. If
you do not agree to these terms, please do not access the website.
What Information is Collected and How is it Used?
A. General Collection and Use of Personal Identifying Information
We will only collect and use personal identifying information (such as a first and last
name, physical address including a street name, telephone number, e-mail address,
etc.) when a user voluntarily provides it to us. In order to use some portions of our
websites, or in order to undertake certain actions (such as setting up an account to
make a purchase), a user must first complete a registration form or provide an e-mail
address that will require disclosure of personal identifying information. Such disclosure
is strictly voluntary. In order to contact us by e-mail, however, you must provide an e-
mail address.
We will use the personal identifying information we collect for limited internal purposes
that may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions, establishing the
identity of account holders, utilization for customer service, development, content
processing, or content classification, and providing you with information concerning our
services. We will retain this information. We also may use that personal identifying
information to improve and customize our content.
We reserve the right to disclose your personal identifying information, if we are required
to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is
reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect


or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees,
customers, or the public.
B. Collection of Non-Personal Identifying Information
We collect and use non-personal identifying information, including IP addresses and
web server log files to track trends, administer the website, track user movement, and
gather demographic information. We use this non-personal identifying information in the
aggregate and to troubleshoot technical errors. We do not combine these types of non-
personal identifying information with personal identifying information. We may also
share aggregated demographic information with our business partners, sponsors,
advertisers, and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
with Metapress.
C. Cookies and Web Service Log File Data
We may place a "cookie" or other tracking or information gathering device used in the
industry in the browser files of a user's computer. A cookie is a piece of data stored on
the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies enable us to track
and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. We
collect information from cookies and other information gathering devices and log files in
the aggregate. We do not collect personal information automatically, but through
“authentication”, “authorization”, “device pairing” or “personalization” capabilities we
may tie this information to personal information that users submit online while
participating in our activities. We are able to access only the information placed in
cookies that our sites set on your computer and the information broadcast by your
browser that identifies the operating system and browser you are using. Users can set
their browsers or third party software to reject cookies. If a user rejects the cookie, the
user may be unable to use portions of our website. Some of the websites we provide
links to also may use cookies. We have no control over these linked websites or access
to or control over cookies or other technology used by linked websites.
D. Usage Information Monitoring
In order to provide better system stability, we monitor sessions on our website. This is
for the purpose of tracking and troubleshooting any technical problems that may arise
when someone accesses our website. By monitoring the usage, we are better prepared
to solve system problems faster. We do not disclose this information to any outside
vendor.
E. Security
Metapress has taken steps to ensure that personal identifying information collected in
the future is secure, and we have limited the number of people who have access to the
information, by electronic security systems and password protections that guard against


unauthorized access. Metapress may provide links to websites outside of Metapress.
These websites may not have the same privacy policies as Metapress. Metapress takes
reasonable care in recommending these websites but is not responsible for their content
or privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of an outside website
when leaving our site and linking to an outside website.
We use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data
exchanged with our site. We have appropriate security measures in place in our
physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we
have collected from you at our site.
F. Collection and Use of Information from Children under the age of 13
This site is not directed toward children and is not designed to collect personal
identifying information from children. If any partner (companies that control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with Metapress) site is designed to be used
by children, we comply with the provisions of the Children’s On-Line Privacy Protection
Act (“COPPA”).
Partner websites for children and teens:
Users of these services may participate in many activities without providing any
personal, identifying information. We do not condition children's participation upon
disclosure of any more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate
in the activity.
We collect the following information:
       If a user wants to use our Personalization features, we ask the user to register
        with their first name only. [This is not considered personal information by the
        FTC.]
       If a user makes a specific request for a one-time e-mail, we request the user's e-
        mail address to respond once, but the e-mail address is deleted immediately
        after responding. [Section 312.5(c)(2)]
       Where we do collect a user's e-mail address to respond more than once to a
        specific request (alerts), we do not allow children under 13 to participate.
We only use the non-personal, identifying information we collect for internal uses, such
as improving and customizing our content. We do not link the information collected
through cookies or other devices to personal information that users submit online while
participating in our activities.
We will not share or distribute this information to any outside third parties not bound by
this Privacy Policy.


At the remaining partner sites, children should not provide information on these sites
and should ask a parent to help them. We urge parents to experience the Web with their
children.
If you are a parent and would like to:
       review any personal, identifying information that we have collected online from
        your child,
       have this information deleted, and/or
       request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information,
       or if you have questions about these information practices,
you may contact us at the address or telephone number listed above.
G. Other Use of Personal Information Collected
From time to time we may send users e-mail messages regarding information or offers
from our partners and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common

telephone number, writing to us at the above address, or sending us a facsimile at the
above facsimile number. If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other

From time to time, we make our customer e-mail list available to our partner
organizations and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with Metapress, whose products or services we think you might find interesting.
If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or
organizations, please let us know by contacting us or by selecting any "opt out" option
available. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with our
partners. We are not responsible for any other list but our own.
If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for
which you requested when providing us with your address.
Persons who supply us with their telephone number on-line will only receive telephone
contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line.
Third-party Advertiser Use of Cookies.
Some advertisements on the Website are served by third-party advertisers, ad networks
and ad servers. These third parties may use to collect information about our users. This
may include information about users' behavior on this and other websites to serve them
interested-based (behavioral) advertising. We do not control these third parties' tracking


technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an
advertisement, you should contact the responsible advertiser directly. From time to time,
we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed
in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we
will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes and provide
you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your
information is used, you should check back at our website periodically or contact us.
H. How to Correct Information
Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those
for which it was originally collected by selecting the "opt out" option or the "Please do
not send me information" option or by contacting us by written request, phone or e-mail
at the contact information above.
Upon request, we will provide you with access to all information that we maintain about
you, including unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password),
contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number), transaction information (e.g.,
dates on which you made purchases, amounts and types of purchases), and any other
information that we maintain about you. Users can access this information, and can
have their personal identifying information corrected, by writing to us at the above
address, sending us an e-mail or by calling us.
