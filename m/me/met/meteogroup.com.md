###### Applications (“Apps”)

Apps downloaded to your mobile phone or tablet may rely on location based services, such as your GPS coordinates to inform you about local forecasts. You may turn off this function within your mobile settings. 

Analytical data may be collected from Apps. This is anonymous data from the App in your handset to monitor and optimise features on the handset. This does not identify your handset or you.  

Cookies are not used within Apps unless your browser is opened as part of the App.  In this case, there may be cookies on the phone web browser. 

MeteoGroup does not collect personal data unless you purchase a Premium account where you are required to provide your email, password, user name and address to receive the Premium service. This data is not given to any third parties and you will only be contacted for service updates.

This Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please note that, if you access other websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

Information that you submit via the Site is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland and your information is processed in accordance with European data protection law.  However your information may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”).  By way of example, this may happen if one or more of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside the EEA or one of our service providers or group companies is located in a country outside the EEA.  If we transfer your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

In addition, if you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those services.
