meteoblue may use technology to track your use of this site, for example, which pages you view and which links your use. This information about your use of this site is called "click-stream data" and helps us determine what is important to you, and what is not.

Click-stream data does not identify you personally. If meteoblue links any click-stream data to your personal name we will treat it as personal data. <br>We may obtain information about you by installing our own marker on your computer. This marker is commonly called a "cookie" and it enables us to know you by a computer-generated, unique identifier. By providing you a unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences, and in situations where those choices or preferences need to be collected again, they can be supplied by us automatically, saving you time and effort. For example, after you set your preferences for a service once, if you access it again your previous selection will be retained and can be displayed or re-entered more quickly. Your computer may be specially configured to reject cookies: please refer to your browser for more information.</p><a name="eztoc15013_1_7" id="eztoc15013_1_7"></a><h2>7 With whom the information may be shared</h2><p>
