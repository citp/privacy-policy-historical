					<p class="PageText">Equis International has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the following Web sites: www.equis.com, www.metastock.com, www.qchartsmetastockpro.com, and www.reutersdatalink.com ("The Sites").</p>
					<p class="SubHeading2">What we use your personal information for</p>
					<p class="PageText">We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer the Web sites.</p>
					<p class="PageText">A "cookie" is a piece of software, which may be sent to your computer. Cookies enable us to collect information about how our web sites and services are being used and to manage them more efficiently. Until you have registered, the cookie will only track general usage patterns and technical information about your computer type and will not be used to identify you individually. We also use agents with your computer to assist with our diagnosis of technical problems and therefore to obtain information about software versions installed and data transmitted, for software compliance purposes and for you/your company to receive software updates, new releases or additional software. Sometimes you can refuse or remove these agents but that means you will not receive this additional software and may suffer service problems and you may lose all rights to support. We therefore do not recommend that you remove or tamper with these agents.</p>
					<p class="PageText">Where advertising is served on to our web sites there may be cookies used to collect technical information and generic usage information but third party advertisers will not be able to relate this to you as an individual without your consent.</p>
					<p class="PageText">Registration forms on the sites may require users to provide contact information (such as name and email address). We use customer contact information from registration forms to send the user information about our company. The customer contact information is also used to contact the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>
					<p class="PageText">The sites may use order forms for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect customer contact information (such as name and email address) and financial information (such as account or credit card numbers). Contact information from order forms is used to fulfill orders and send information about our company to our customers. The customer contact information is also used to contact customers when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information is used to bill the customer for products and services.</p>
					<p class="PageText">On the sites, we may run contests in which users are asked for contact information (such as name and email address). Contact information from contests is used to send participants information about our company. Participant contact information may also be used to contact the participant when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>
					<p class="SubHeading1">Calls to Help Desks</p>
					<p class="PageText">Calls to telephone help desks may be recorded for quality control, regulatory and monitoring purposes.</p>
					<p class="SubHeading1">International Transfer of Your Information</p>
					<p class="PageText">Because our services and the Reuters Group are international, personal data may be made available internationally, including in countries which do not have data protection laws, or laws which provide as much protection as in the country of origin. We seek to require those to whom we transfer your data to protect it and your privacy. This way we work to protect personal data transferred to countries which do not have data protection laws or whose laws are less strict</p>
					<p class="SubHeading2">Security</p>
					<p class="PageText">The sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.</p>
					<p class="SubHeading2">Storage Methods and Duration</p>
					<p class="PageText">We may store your information in our databases, such as our Customer Relationship database, for reference. The information may be retained and used by us for a reasonable period, reflecting our need to answer queries or resolve problems, provide improved and new services and any data retention requirements of the law. This means we may retain information after an individual ceases to use our services or after the individual has ceased interacting with us. Except where the law, authorities or regulatory bodies require us to retain it for longer, we retain Traffic Data for a reasonable period after the Traffic Data was generated, including in some circumstances (such as with firewall logs or fault data) after any bill has been paid. The details of money laundering checks, user authentication or verification checks and details of trading or other regulated activity may be retained for so long as the law or the regulator requires or evidence of the trade is required.</p>
					<p class="SubHeading2">Passing your Information to Third Parties</p>
					<p class="PageText">Except where the law permits or unless you specifically agree, we do not sell or rent your personal data to others outside the Reuters Group.</p>
					<p class="PageText">In some instances, we may pass information to third parties involved in the relevant Reuters Group service (such as to stock exchanges or third party information and software providers) who wish to manage and check the distribution of their information/software and obtain payment for it. They may then match it with the data they have for this purpose. You will generally know if such a transfer of your personal data happens, except if the third parties are simply working on our behalf as our subcontractors, administrators (such as companies that process credit card payments) or our professional advisers or if the data is required to be disclosed by law or to a regulator – then we might not inform you.</p>
					<p class="PageText">If we sell a business division to another company and your personal data is used by that business then your data may be transferred to the buyer along with the business for them to use in the same way.</p>
					<p class="SubHeading2">Choice/Opt-Out</p>
					<p class="PageText">The sites provide users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. </p>
					<p class="PageText">The sites give users the following options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications, or to no longer receive our service.</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="PageText">Send email to <a href="mailto:sales@equis.com">sales@equis.com</a><br>&nbsp;</li>
						<li class="PageText">Send mail to the following postal address:<br><br>90 South 400 West<br>Suite 620<br>Salt Lake City, UT 84101<br>&nbsp;</li>
						<li class="PageText">Call either of the following telephone numbers: 800-508-9180 or 801-265-8886</li>

						<li class="PageText">Call either of the following telephone numbers: 800-508-9180 or 801-265-8886</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="SubHeading2">Interception of Mail</p>
					<p class="PageText">We may intercept some mail and email addressed to individuals in Equis. The reasons we may do this are related to security of Equis, its staff and others, for detection and prevention of crime and to identify correct recipients or to make sure mail is dealt with during staff absence. In the case of emails, we may reject, delay or remove content from emails which have a nature, content or attachments which may disrupt our systems or because they may pose security issues such as viruses. We may also filter out emails which contain certain content on the basis that content is offensive or the email is unwanted or spam. In certain circumstances this may unfortunately result in "innocent" emails being affected but we do try and reduce such occurrences.</p>
					<p class="SubHeading2">Links to Other Sites</p>
					<p class="PageText">The sites may contain links to other sites.  The Reuters Group is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>
					<p class="SubHeading2">Definitions</p>
					<p class="PageText">Reuters Group means Reuters Group plc and subsidiaries or corporate entities as they exist from time to time and in which Reuters Group plc has a direct or indirect ownership interest of 50% or more. This includes some companies which do not have the word "Reuters" in their corporate name and which use other brands such as Yankee, Tower, Lipper, Instinet, Radianz, ICor, Multex Investor or Bridge.</p>
