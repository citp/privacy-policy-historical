We are an international group and your Personal Information may be stored and Processed in any country where we have operations or in which we engage service providers. Where we transfer your Personal Information from the European Economic Area (EEA) to recipients located outside the EEA who are not in Adequate Jurisdictions, we do so on the basis of [**Standard Contractual Clauses**](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002D0016&from=EN).

Your Personal Information will only be shared with third parties (including our group companies) that have committed to maintain strict organisational and technical measures to protect your Personal Information.

We employ physical, electronic and managerial control procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorised access to your information. We choose these safeguards based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, Process and store and the current state of technology. Our outsourced service providers who support our operations are also vetted to ensure that they too have the appropriate organisational and technical measures in place to protect your Personal Information. You can request a copy of our technical and organisational measures by using the contact information on the first page of this Privacy Policy.

  * **Service providers and partners.** We retain service providers and partners to manage or support certain aspects of our business operations on our behalf. These service providers may be located in the EEA, US or in other locations and may provide services such as service delivery, report personalisation, advertising and marketing activities (including digital and personalised advertising), IT services, email service providers, data hosting, and management or support of our websites. Our service providers are required to safeguard any Personal Information they receive from us and are prohibited from using the Personal Information for any purpose other than to perform the services as instructed by us. We may also share your Personal Information with accountants, auditors, lawyers and other outside professional advisers to Argus Media, subject to binding contractual obligations of confidentiality. We also take steps to provide adequate protection for any transfers of your Personal Information in accordance with applicable law.
  * **Affiliates.** We may for our legitimate interests share your information with other companies under common ownership or control with us who will Process your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and subject to appropriate safeguards. These companies may be based within or outside of the EEA and, in some cases, in countries which do not afford the same level of Personal Information protection as may be found, for instance, in EU countries. All such companies are, nevertheless, bound by an intra-group agreement under which they are required to maintain strict organisational and technical measures to protect your Personal Information. Details of our group companies may be [**found here**](https://web.archive.org/en/privacy-policy/argus-media-group-companies).
  * **Compliance with law and protection of people and property.** We may share your information when we believe in good faith that such sharing is reasonably necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities or to comply with legal process. We may also share your information in situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Policy, or to respond to the claims of violation of the rights of third parties and/or to protect the rights, property and safety of Argus Media, our employees, users, or the public. This may involve the sharing of your information with law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organisations.
  * **Business Transactions.** As we develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets or the assets disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction.



This section sets out the legal rights you may have, subject to applicable law, in respect of your Personal Information that we Process.

To exercise any of the rights below, please email or write to the Argus Data Protection Officer at the address shown on the first page of this Privacy Policy.

  * **Right to object**



**You have the right to object to the Processing of your Personal Information where we have exercised the right to Process on the grounds of our legitimate interest.**

Marketing emails you receive from us include an unsubscribe instruction (usually found at the bottom of the email) that you may use to stop receiving future marketing-related emails.

  


  * **Right to withdraw your consent**



**Where you have given us your consent to Process your Personal Information and we use this as the only basis to Process your Personal Information, you may withdraw your consent at any time.**

For example, you may withdraw your consent from marketing emails by unsubscribing using the unsubscribe link usually found at the bottom of the email. Please note that we may be unable to provide you with the full benefit of our Sites, or services, if you choose to withdraw your consent.

  * **Correction of errors in information**



You can ask us to correct any errors in your Personal Information that we hold and Process. If you are unable to update your Personal Information through Argus Content Platforms, please make a request by email or write to the Argus Data Protection Officer at the address shown on the first page of this Privacy Policy.

  * **Right to erasure**



If you request us to do so and there is no valid reason for us to retain it, we will erase your Personal Information without undue delay. 

  


  * **Right to restriction**



You are entitled to seek the restriction of Processing if there is a disagreement between us as to whether the right of erasure applies. You may seek this right:

  1. for the time needed to verify whether information is accurate if you have contested its accuracy; or
  2. where you feel that we no longer need the data but you do for the purposes of a legal claim; or
  3. you have objected to the Processing but we seek to establish that we have compelling legitimate grounds for overriding your objection.



Where this right applies we will temporarily remove the data from our systems so as to avoid further Processing and we will flag the restricted data in a way that makes it clear that Processing is restricted.

  * **Right to object to profiling**



You may object to our Processing of your Personal Information where we:

  1. predict your service preferences, for example, by monitoring your browsing behaviour when you visit Argus Content Platforms; or
  2. rely on automated decisions that have legal consequences or significantly affect you.


  * **Right to data portability**



Where we Process your Personal Information by automated means and the Processing is either based on your consent or a contract with you, you can request that we transfer your Personal Information in a commonly used machine-readable form to a third-party system.

We are not responsible if the Processing systems are incompatible such that your Personal Information cannot be read by the third-party system. 

  * **Right to make a complaint**



We are headquartered in London, UK. If you live in the EU, you have the right to raise a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) or with the Supervisory Authority in the EU country in which you feel that your rights were infringed.

ICO contact details may be found at this link: [**https://ico.org.uk/**](https://ico.org.uk/)

If you live outside of the EU, privacy laws in your country may also you give this right.

You have the right to access your Personal Information that we maintain about you and is held by us in paper records or electronic systems. You can make a request by email or write to the Argus Data Protection Officer at the address shown on the first page of this Privacy Policy. 

We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it is collected. This may vary according to the nature of your relationship with us.
