		<p>Credit Unions in Canada have a long history of respecting the rights of their members. As a co-operative
			financial institution, Meridian Credit Union is committed to the development of policies, procedures
			and service offerings that maintain these rights.<br>

			your privacy and your right to control the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.</p>

			and Procedures, and appointed a Privacy Officer. You are entitled to review the Code at any time, access
			your personal information, or contact the Privacy Officer through our Contact Centre about a privacy issue or concern.
			Through these actions, what has been our accepted practice becomes our documented commitment to you, the Member.</p>

				credit reporting agencies and other financial institutions, and, with your specific consent, other parties.</li>
			<li>To detect and prevent fraud, and to help safeguard the financial interests of the credit union and its members.</li>
			<li>To meet legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
