You may not promote your referral links through unsolicited emailing (i.e. SPAMMING), newsgroup postings, or any other method of mass communication. Failure to comply will result in immediate termination of your membership with Merchant Shares, and may result in legal prosecution. Merchant Shares strictly enforces anti-Spamming laws. Spamming is a Federal crime in the U.S. Any member caught Spamming will not only have their account terminated immediately and lose any past, present and future earnings, but shall also be held liable for spamming as we shall cooperate with any authorities and investigations that may arise from the spamming incident.

Merchant Shares may undertake, at the sole discretion of its management team and with or without prior notice, the following enforcement actions.

Account Suspension: Upon the receipt of a credible complaint, Merchant Shares may immediately suspend the membership of the individual implicated in the abuse. Suspension is intended to prevent the abuser from benefiting from their abusive activities by prohibiting the offender from registering referrals. After a thorough investigation, if the spamming incident is verified, but does not rise to the level of a terminable offense, Edenloops may lift the suspension.

Account Termination: Upon the receipt of a credible complaint, Merchant Shares may immediately terminate the membership of the individual implicated in the abuse. Termination results in the immediate closure of the account, the loss of all referrals, and a prohibition against any future membership.
