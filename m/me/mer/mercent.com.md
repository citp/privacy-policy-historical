# Company - Privacy Policy - Mercent

**Introduction**

Mercent Corporation is committed to consumer privacy. This Privacy Policy is written to document Mercent's consumer privacy commitment and explain how Mercent collects and uses consumer information.

**Information Mercent Collects and How it is Used**

Mercent collects information to measure the effectiveness of online product advertising activities performed by our retail customers. This information is used by Mercent's retail customers to understand which products to advertise and where to advertise in order to best present their products and services to consumers. Mercent also collects similar information for use in operating and improving our corporate Web site, www.mercent.com.

 **How Mercent Helps Retailers Understand their Advertising Effectiveness**

Mercent collects performance information by assigning a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for each retailer advertisement on a Mercent-support online channel. These URLs link to Mercent's hosted software systems. Mercent notes the referring (source) Web site for each consumer referred through these URLs and places a small text file or 'cookie' on the consumer's computer. Cookies are also placed on the consumer's computer after a consumer has been successfully referred to a retailer's Web site. The cookie associates the consumer's visit with the product offered by the retail advertiser. This allows Mercent to report on the retailer's online advertising effectiveness. Mercent only collects anonymous and non-personally identifiable consumer data to help retailers improve advertising effectiveness. At no time is personally identifiable consumer information gathered or used by Mercent.

 **More About Cookies**

When you visit a Mercent Web site, Mercent may place one or more cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer's hard drive by a Web server. Some cookies are used to assist you with your session on Mercent Web sites. Depending on the cookie, the cookie may expire at the end of your browsing session or may stay on your computer until the expiration date specified in the cookie is in the past. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be accessed or read by the Internet domain (generally a Web site) that placed them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of Mercent Web sites that depend on the your Web browser accepting cookies.

 **Mercent Request Information Form**

If you fill out the Mercent Request Information Form, you will enter certain personal information such as name and company name, work address and telephone number, as well as certain demographic and company information, including city, state, country, zip code, Channel information and information systems information. Mercent uses this information to communicate with you. All such information is provided voluntarily by you. Mercent does not sell, rent or lease such information to third parties. Mercent may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Mercent.

 **No Information from Minors**

Mercent Corporation does not and has no intention of collecting personal information from children. If you would like more information about privacy and the Internet, you may refer to http://www.ftc.gov/bcp on the Federal Trade Commission's Web site.

 **Use of IP Addresses**

Your use of Mercent software or services including visiting Mercent's Web sites involves the transmission of your Internet protocol address ("IP Address") to Mercent's servers. This IP address is necessary for communication with you via the Internet and may be used and stored on our servers. With the cooperation of your Internet service provider, it may be possible for your IP address to be used to identify you personally. However, Mercent agrees that it will not use your IP address for this purpose, unless required by law. Mercent does use IP addresses to determine the general geographic locations of our users, but this does not involve the collection of any personally identifiable information.

 **Information Disclosure**

Mercent may disclose the information we collect as reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation or other governmental authority. Mercent may also disclose your information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Mercent's stock or assets in Mercent's line of business to which this Privacy Policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization.

 **Control of Your Personal Information**

Mercent offers you choices for the collection, use and sharing of any personal information that you have voluntarily provided to us. You may choose not to receive marketing materials from Mercent, and you may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Mercent by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. These communications choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain Mercent services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the service. You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information by writing to sales@mercent.com.

 **Security of your Personal Information**

Mercent is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit over the Internet or store highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password), we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Link (Tracking)

Some Channels pass credit card information through our system to the retail merchant (seller-of-record) for processing. To facilitate secure data transfer, Mercent encrypts the credit card information as it enters our system. Mercent does not possess the key required to decrypt this information. Only the merchant has this key. Once the merchant has confirmed receipt of the information, we remove it from our system to ensure compliance with the PCI Data Security Standard. More information regarding this standard is available at:http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/cisp.html

 **Sharing Information**

Mercent does report aggregated information regarding the use of our services to our Merchant partners. These statistics never include personally identifying consumer information.

 **Links to non-Mercent Web Sites and their Privacy Policies**

A link on the Mercent Web site to a non-Mercent Web site does not imply Mercent's endorsement of that Web site, advertiser or product. Mercent does not control the Web sites to which we may link and assumes no responsibility for their content or privacy policies.  
This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by Mercent. Any information that you provide to linked Web sites or other third parties is provided directly to such third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Therefore, you should carefully review the privacy policies that apply to any Web sites you access.

 **Mercent Changes**

Mercent reserves the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time. Mercent will post changes on the privacy policy page of the Mercent Web site located at http://www.mercent.com/about-mercent/privacy-policy. Your use of Mercent software or services following the posting of such changes to the Mercent Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of any such changes.
