If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“ ** _EEA_** ”), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your Personal Information.

### A) What Personal Data Do We Collect from You?

Personal data is information that can be used to identify you such as your name, IP address, and email address. As a business, we collect personal data from you in a number of ways, including:

 **1) Comments on the Sites.** When visitors leave comments on our sites, we collect the data shown in the comments form (name and email address), and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to assist with spam detection.

 **5) BIWS Lesson Completion, Note, Quiz, and Certification Data.**  If you complete lessons within the courses offered on BIWS, or you enter notes on the lessons, take quizzes, or receive certificates there, we retain this data.

 **6) BIWS Site Usage Data from FullStory.** We use a service called “FullStory” (https://www.fullstory.com/) to track your interactions with the BIWS site, such as the links you click on, the files you download, and your web browser and geographic location.

We collect the information above for the following purposes:

We also use it to review how users, in aggregate, interact with our sales and promotional material (e.g., the percentage of users that read the entire page before purchasing).

### C) What Legal Basis Do We Have For Collecting and Processing Your Information?

Websites must have a legal basis for collecting information from individuals located in the EEA. Our legal basis for each of the ways we collect information from you is as follows. Please note where consent forms the basis, you can withdraw consent at any time by contacting our support team at [accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com](mailto:accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com) or opting out of any email message using the “Unsubscribe” link.

 **1) Comments on the Sites.** We have an allowed legitimate interest in providing a response to your questions and need to use your data to do so. We will not use the data for other purposes.

 **4) Opt-In to Product-Specific Newsletters.** We will ask for your consent first.

 **5) BIWS Lesson Completion, Note, Quiz, and Certification Data.** We have an allowed legitimate interest in providing you with a way to track your course completion progress and test your knowledge along the way. We will not use the data for other purposes.

 **6) BIWS Site Usage Data from FullStory.** We have an allowed legitimate interest in resolving technical problems and bugs on the site and reviewing user interactions to improve the overall site experience.

“Legitimate interests” for processing your personal information exist where you submit the information with an expectation that it will be processed and there is no undue impact on you.

If you disagree or have questions, please contact us at [accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com](mailto:accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com) and we will cease the processing of your data under this legal basis.

### D) Who Has Access to the Data We Collect?

We access and process the data we collect from you. However, we use third parties to assist us with processing your personal data, including the following categories of recipients:

  * Financial transaction processors (processing your payments).
  * Customer service communication platform.
  * Email communication manager.
  * Marketing funnel providers.
  * Website management services.
  * Website design and programming services.



These third parties have signed contract with us in which they are prohibited from utilizing, sharing, or retaining your personal data for any purpose other than we dictate.

### E) Cookies and Similar Technologies

A cookie is a very small text document that often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.

Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

Our sites use cookies and similar technologies to track particular aspects of you and other people who visit us.

For example, we use Google Analytics to track data such as time spent on site, the most popular pages, and the most common keywords used to find our sites. We retain user data for 26 months in Google Analytics, which is the default policy.

This tracking is done to provide us with information on how people use the sites, what is of interest to them and what is not, how our marketing is performing, and incidental items such as the percentage of users who access the site from a personal computer versus a mobile phone.

We also use cookies for remarketing purposes in conjunction with outside services such as Google Adwords and Facebook advertising. For example, if you visited a product page but did not purchase anything, we may display ads for the product via these services.

You may block or delete cookies by adjusting your browser settings or by responding to the cookie consent notice that appears when you visit our sites.

### F) How Long Do We Keep Your Data?

We keep your personal data for different periods of time depending on the reason it was gathered in the first place.

 **1) Comments on the Site.** As long as your account remains open and you do not request a cancellation or refund, we retain this data because it is intended to help you complete the courses more effectively and receive answers to your questions. We will not use the data for other purposes. We keep comments on M&I unless you have specifically made a request to delete them.

 **2) Opt-In to Banker Blueprint or “Free Tutorials” Newsletters.** 36 Months.

 **3) Transactions.** Due to U.S. tax/audit requirements, we must retain transaction data indefinitely.

 **4) Opt-In to Product-Specific Newsletters.** 36 Months.

 **5) BIWS Lesson Completion, Note, Quiz, and Certification Data.** As long as your account remains open and you do not request a cancellation or refund, we retain this data because it is intended to help you complete the courses more effectively. We will not use the data for other purposes.

 **6) BIWS Site Usage Data from FullStory.** 2 Months.

If a legal claim arises involving your data, we will store and disclose that data until the matter has resolved.

If you wish to have your data removed from one of the categories in which the holding period is “indefinite” or “as long as your account is open” (items #1, #3, and #5 above), please contact us at [accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com](mailto:accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com) and we will process this request for you.

In the case of item #3, Transactions, we must retain the original purchase record, but we will anonymize it by removing your name and billing information.

### G) Your Right to Ask for Corrections, Erasure, and Export of Your Data

You have the right to control your personal data. Specifically, you have the following rights:

  * The right to be informed: We are informing you now with this policy.

### H) Your Right to Withdraw Consent

If you receive email messages from us, you can use the “unsubscribe” link in each message to withdraw consent and stop the mailings.

Alternatively, you can contact us at [accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com](mailto:accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com) with your request.

### I) Do We Transfer Your Data To Third Countries?

In order to provide you with the Services you subscribe to or that you request from us, your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States as that is where Capital Capable Media is based. In some cases, your Personal Information may be accessed from other countries outside the United States, including when you consent and allow us to do so, where it is required in order for us to provide Services to you and when we need to do so to provide functions like product support, troubleshooting and gaining insights into the usage patterns of our Services. When your Personal Information is transferred to the United States and other countries, you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law. Any international transfers of your Personal Information will be done in accordance with applicable law.
