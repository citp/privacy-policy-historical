The responsible party is the natural person or legal entity, authority, institution or other office that, alone or together with others, makes decisions regarding the purposes and means of processing personal data. If the purposes and means of processing said data are specified by Union law or the rights of the Member States, the responsible party(ies) can stipulate the specific criteria for his/her appointment according to Union law or the rights of the Member States.

 **(6)  ** **PROCESSOR**

A processor is a natural person or legal entity, authority, institution or other office that processes personal data on behalf of the responsible party.

 **(7)  ** **RECIPIENT**

The recipient is a natural person or legal entity, authority, institution or other office to whom the personal data is disclosed, regardless of whether it is a third party or not. However, authorities that may receive personal data as part of a specific investigative order in accordance with Union law or the rights of Members States shall not be considered as recipients.

 **(8)  ** **THIRD PARTY**

A third party is a natural person or legal entity, authority, institution or other office, not including the person concerned, the responsible party, the processor and persons under the direct supervision of the person in charge or the processor, who is authorized to process the personal data.

 **(9)  ** **CONSENT**

Consent is any declaration of intention in the form of a declaration or other clear confirmation of treatment voluntarily issued by the person concerned in an informed and unmistakable manner for the specific situation in which the person concerned makes clear that he/she consents to have his/her relevant personal data processed.

However, one exception applies in such cases in which prior receipt of consent is not possible for actual reasons and processing the data is nevertheless permitted by legal regulations.

 **(2) LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA**

The data transmitted by you or collected are collected, used, processed and saved exclusively under the data protection laws (GDPR, Federal Data Protection Act and the Telemedia Act) in effect and, if applicable forwarded to third parties – to the extent legally specified, contractually necessary or permitted as part of the legal bases presented below.

Based on Art. 6 GDPR, there are various legal bases for processing your personal data which are referred to in this privacy statement:

5\. If the processing of personal data is necessary to protect a justified interest of our company or a third party and, in the process, the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not outweigh this initial interest of our company, or the interest of a third party, then processing is carried out on the legal basis stated in Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR.
