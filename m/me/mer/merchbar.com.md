## How does Merchbar protect my personal data?

Merchbar implements commercially reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information. 

The profile information associated with a Merchbar user account is protected by the password each member uses to access their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your login information and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password for your Merchbar account, the website allows you to request instructions that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). 

While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access. 

## How does Merchbar share / transfer my personal data?

We may provide your information to third parties that perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, product delivery, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services and customer service. 

Merchbar may subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your home country. Your personal data may therefore be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/pages/help/privacy). 

For more information, please refer to Section 5 of our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/pages/help/privacy).
