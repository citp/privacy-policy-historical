We understand individuals have rights to privacy and concerns about the security and integrity of data. Therefore, we do not share any personally identifiable information submitted through the forms or e-mail links on this site with any entity outside Mercy unless you authorize us to do so or we are required to do so by law.

### Notice of Privacy Practices

Mercy's Notice of Privacy Practices ("NPP") is a separate document that governs how medical information about you may be used and disclosed by Mercy, as well as our obligations to maintain its confidentiality. The health system is operated through regional organizations that serve a defined market area or offering a distinct line of services.

The NPP is different for each of the geographic regions we serve. The NPP for your geographic area can be selected by clicking on the appropriate link below:

### Website Privacy Policy Statement

Our use and disclosure of an individual's personal information (including protected health information) is limited as required by federal and state law. We do not sell or rent personal information about visitors to this site or customers who use the site.

This website has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.

We do not associate IP addresses with any personally identifiable information. These logs may contain: the Internet domain from which you access the site (such as aol.com; abc.org; etc.); the IP address which is automatically assigned to your computer when you get on the Internet (a static IP address may be identifiable as being connected to you, while a dynamic address is usually not identifiable); the type of browser and operating system you use; the date and time you visited the site; the pages you viewed on the site; and, the address of the website you linked from, if any.
