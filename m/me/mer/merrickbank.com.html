		Merrick Bank's Privacy Pledge</h1>
	<h2>
		Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
	<p class="PageContent JustifiedText">
		Our Privacy Pledge is provided to help you understand how we protect your financial
		privacy. It provides you with an opportunity to make informed choices about the
		management of personal information about you. At Merrick Bank, we maintain high
		standards to safeguard Personal Information. We will remain vigilant in protecting
		that information and in using it in a fair and lawful manner.
		<br>
		<br>
		This Pledge explains our privacy commitment. It is not intended to be a contract.
		It identifies the Personal Information that we collect and hold, and describes how
		we use, share and secure it. It also tells you how to contact us if you have any
		questions regarding this Pledge or our privacy practices.
	</p>
	<p class="PageContent JustifiedText">
		<span class="BoldText">To whom and what does this Pledge apply?</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		This Pledge covers the Personal Information of current and former individual Merrick
		Bank customers.<br>
		<br>
		Our Pledge applies to all personally identifiable financial information about you
		that is obtained by Merrick Bank in connection with providing a consumer financial
		product or service for personal, family or household purposes.
	</p>
	<p class="PageContent JustifiedText">
		<span class="BoldText">What Personal Information do we collect and how do we collect
			it? </span>
		<br>
		<br>
		Based on our relationship with you, we collect Personal Information from and about
		you that is adequate, relevant and appropriate under the circumstances. For example,
		we may collect or verify the following categories of Personal Information from or
		about you in the following ways:
	</p>
	<p class="PageContentDetail JustifiedText">

		information including your VISA® and MasterCard® transactions, loan performance
		and funds transfers.<br>
		<br>
		•&nbsp;<span class="BoldText">From entities outside of the Merrick Bank corporate
			family ("nonaffiliated third parties")</span>, information including your creditworthiness/credit
		history and identity. These nonaffiliated third parties include consumer/credit-reporting
		agencies, verification services, entities that provide us with mailing lists, and
		publicly available reference sources.<br>
		<br>
		•&nbsp;<span class="BoldText">From your visits to our Web site</span>, information
		including certain technical information about your computer and operating systems.
		Our Web site practices, including the use of "cookies," are described further on
		our Web site. A cookie is a file that identifies a computer as a unique user. Cookies
		may be used to facilitate your use of our Web site, to maintain site security and
		to improve our Web site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You
		may be able to reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie

	<p class="PageContent JustifiedText">
		<span class="BoldText">How do we use Personal Information?</span><br>
		<br>
		We use Personal Information to operate our business in a prudent and efficient manner.
		This may include, depending on the nature of your relationship with us, using it
		to evaluate financial needs; offer products and services (such as our insurance
		offerings); process and service transactions; respond to inquiries and requests;
		fulfill our obligations to you; verify income, asset and obligation information;
		resolve disputes; prevent fraud; and perform risk control. Additionally, we may
		use your Personal Information to verify your identity, including, where applicable,
		verification in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act.<br>
		<br>
		Where permitted and appropriate, we may also use your Personal Information for Merrick
		Bank's marketing and product research and/or development purposes. Additionally,
		we use your Personal Information to comply with legal requirements, and in accordance
		with applicable laws, rules and regulations.</p>
	<p class="PageContent JustifiedText">
		<span class="BoldText">What Personal Information We Disclose and to Whom?</span><br>
		<br>
		We may disclose all of the Personal Information (described above) that we collect
		about current and former customers as described in the following section to the
		following:
	</p>
	<p class="PageContentDetail">
		•&nbsp;Affiliates (i.e., companies related to us by common control or ownership)
		of Merrick Bank Corporation and its parent, CardWorks, L.P.; and
		<br>
		<br>
		•&nbsp;Nonaffiliated third parties (i.e., third parties that are not members
		of our corporate family) such as financial service providers (i.e., VISA USA, Inc.,
		MasterCard International, Incorporated, other banks and financial institutions,
		and insurance companies) and non-financial companies (i.e., retailers, direct marketers,
		marketing partners, and others).
	</p>
	<p class="PageContent JustifiedText">
		<span class="BoldText">What Personal Information do we share internally among Merrick
			Bank companies and why do we share it?</span><br>
		<br>
		In connection with the uses described above, we may, depending on the nature of

		and among Merrick Bank's "affiliates" (i.e., companies related to us by common control
		or ownership such as CardWorks Servicing, LLC and CardWorks, Inc.).<br>
		<br>
		Merrick Bank affiliates provide a number of crucial services to Merrick Bank in
		connection with the servicing and maintenance of our customers' accounts. Merrick
		Bank may share your Personal Information with affiliated third parties solely so
		that such affiliates can provide those services. Our affiliates are required to
		make contractual commitments to us to maintain the confidentiality of our customers'
		Personal Information.
		<br>
		<br>
		We are permitted under law to share Personal Information relating to our experiences
		or transactions with you or your account (such as your account balance and your
		payment history with us) with our affiliates. We also may share additional information
		about your account (such as information we receive from you in applications and
		information from credit reporting agencies) with our affiliates. You may direct
		us not to disclose to our affiliates information that does not relate solely to
		our or our affiliates' experiences or transactions with you (and your co-account
		holder or authorized user) or your account by completing the online

		<span class="BoldText">What Personal Information do we share externally with nonaffiliated
			third parties and why do we share it? </span>
		<br>
		<br>
		Merrick Bank does not rent or sell Personal Information. In connection with the
		uses described above (for example, processing your application with us), we may,
		depending on the nature of your relationship with us, transfer some or all of your
		Personal Information to nonaffiliated third parties. These nonaffiliated third parties
		may be financial service providers (such as VISA USA, Inc., MasterCard International,
		Incorporated, other banks and financial institutions, and insurance companies),
		non-financial companies (such as government entities in response to subpoenas, consumer
		reporting agencies or technology companies) or others (such as professional services
		organizations or other service providers).
		<br>
		<br>
		To the extent the law permits, Merrick Bank may also disclose certain Personal Information
		to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial
		institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. This Personal Information
		includes:

		Merrick Bank typically provides consumer services to adults only and does not intend
		to collect or knowingly collect any information from or about children. It is possible
		that a child may impersonate an adult and attempt to apply for a Merrick Bank issued
		credit card or may apply for a consumer loan or other product. In so doing, they
		may provide their name, address, phone number, fax number, email address and other
		identifying information. When such information is received and Merrick Bank is aware
		that the individual providing the information is a child, the information is used
		only to reject the child's application. Such information is never shared with third
		parties. Merrick Bank cannot always determine if a visitor to its Web site or the
		sender of an email is a child.<br>
		<br>
		•&nbsp;<span class="BoldText">"Cookies."</span> Our Web site makes use of a
		standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" to assign each visitor a

		Bank does not transfer any information to these other sites.
