MerchantWords may offer online resources that facilitate communications among the MerchantWords client community and others. Whenever you voluntarily post information to any public forum offered by MerchantWords, such information along with your user name can be accessed by other users of the forum, including members of the public if the forum is open to the public.

**COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES**

We and our service providers use cookies in connection with our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your computer’s or mobile device's memory. Some cookies help you navigate our Services, including setting a cookie to remember your login details. Cookies also help us better understand the effectiveness of our Services and to highlight areas we can improve (for example, by tracking the way in which you respond to, select and interact with our Services, by allowing us to evaluate aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services). If you submit an inquiry through our Service and provide your name and email and similar information, that personal information will not be tied back to you for interest-based advertising purposes across websites and applications, however, you may receive email marketing communications from us, and you may received interest-based advertising from third parties based on cookies dropped on your device by our third party service providers.  To opt out of marketing communications and interest-based advertising by third parties, see “ **Choices**.” 

We and our service providers may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons", "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively "Pixel Tags") to analyze usage patterns of consumers. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, which is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page or in a mobile application and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Some Pixel Tags are used to drop cookies on users’ devices. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited our Services and pages within our Services, and to help determine the effectiveness of our Services. 

Third parties may use cookies or similar technologies on visitors of our Services to serve interest-based advertisements to such visitors when they visit other websites and mobile applications. The collection of information through cookies or similar technologies by such third parties will be governed by such third parties’ own privacy policies and principles, which MerchantWords does not control. 

For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). 

To read about your choices with regard to MerchantWord’s and third parties’ uses of cookies in our Services, please see “ **Choices**.”

We do not track users when they cross to third party websites, and we do not provide targeted advertising to them, and therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

**LEGAL BASIS RELIED ON FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INDIVIDUALS**

MerchantWords is a data controller with respect to the personal data collected or received by us (such as email address and credit card numbers) through our Services.  In this case, the data controller is Merchant Words, LLC.  Depending on the data processed, we rely on various legal bases for the processing. We may process personal information (such as your email address and credit card number) with your consent or to fulfill our obligations under our contract with you, such as our obligation to give you access to our Services that you paid for and to process payment.  On certain occasions, we may also rely on the consent of the individual to process personal information (for example, in some jurisdictions, when the user inputs personal information into the Services and consents to receive marketing communications). On other occasions we may rely on legitimate interest as a basis for processing, when it is in our legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights. Those legitimate interests include performing our obligations with respect to providing the Services and improving our Services.

**RETENTION**

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or an individual requests deletion in accordance with applicable law.  See “ **Access and Rights regarding Personal Information**.” 

**CHOICES**

**Opting Out of Marketing**

We give you choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes.

You may opt-out from receiving electronic communications from us. If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing related emails by contacting us at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9dedeff4ebfcfee4ddf0f8effef5fcf3e9eaf2eff9eeb3fef2f0) or by clicking on the opt-out link within the email message that you receive from us.

**Opting Out of MerchantWords’ cookies**

You may disable cookies, including MerchantWords cookies, by modifying the settings in your browser.  However, please note that certain features of the Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies.  

**Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising from Third Parties’ Cookies**

Some third parties who use cookies when you visit our websites, also have opt out mechanisms either directly from their website or through an industry-developed web page. When you opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, note that the opt out only applies to the applicable browser in which you set it. Note also that most opt out tools are cookie-based. This means that, if you have cookies blocked, you will not be able to use it. Note also that if you delete cookies entirely then you will need to opt out again. Finally, note that once the opt-out has been completed, you will still receive advertisements, but such advertisements will not be interest-based ads.   
  
If you go to optout.aboutads.info or [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), you can learn how to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across multiple third-party websites, online services, devices, and applications for interest-based advertising purposes.

The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. These third parties are bound by their own privacy policies.
