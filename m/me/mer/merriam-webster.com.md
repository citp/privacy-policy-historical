# Merriam-Webster Online

## _Updated September 27, 2010_

Merriam-Webster is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to its Web sites. The guidelines below explain how we protect the privacy of visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine and its features.

## Personally Identifiable Information

Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine by limiting the collection of personally identifiable information. For certain promotions and to access certain features, such as to receive a Word of the Day subscription, we may request a voluntary submission of information such as name, e-mail address, city, state, and age.

Merriam-Webster does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 13, except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Merriam-Webster has any information from or about anyone under 13, please e-mail us at [privacy@m-w.com](mailto:privacy@m-w.com).

All personally identifiable information you provide to us for subscriptions through Merriam-Webster OnLine is used by Merriam-Webster and its staff to process and manage subscriptions, analyze the demographic of our subscribers, or to deliver services through the site; such information may also be used by the company for prize or information-request fulfillment unless otherwise indicated. Such information will not be posted or published by us, and will be shared with third parties only for the purpose of payment processing.

If you choose to provide personally identifiable information to us, you may receive the following types of e-mails from us:

  * E-mails related to subscription-maintenance activities.
  * Periodic e-mail newsletters highlighting new features, content, and usage tips for Merriam-Webster OnLine.
  * Periodic special offers for additional Merriam-Webster and Encyclopædia Britannica (Merriam-Webster's parent company) products and services.
  * Periodic special offers from Merriam-Webster approved partners if you "opt-in" or give us your permission to send them.



When you provide personally identifiable information to us, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive special Merriam-Webster or partner offers. Each offer will also have information available to allow you to "opt out" if you wish to receive no further offers.

Merriam-Webster OnLine may also use other third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of providing these services, such as Word of the Day,to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster OnLine.

Merriam-Webster may also disclose personally identifiable information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.

## Anonymous Information

Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.

## Cookies—Use by Merriam-Webster; Opting Out

We use cookies and software logs to monitor the use of Merriam-Webster OnLine and to gather non-personal information about visitors to the site. Cookies are small files that Merriam-Webster transfers to the hard drives of visitors for record-keeping purposes. These monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance, Comcast) they use. This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services requested by our customers. To delete these cookies, which are browser cookies, please see your browser's privacy settings.

## Cookies and Beacons—Use by Third-Parties; Opting Out

A beacon is an electronic file object (typically a transparent image) placed in the code of a Web page. We use third party beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one Merriam-Webster OnLine page to another and to improve site performance. None of the information we gather in this way can be used to identify any individual who visits the site.

Merriam-Webster uses the services of one or more third parties to present or target the advertisements, promotions, and other marketing messages that you may see on various Web pages,to conduct research about such advertisements, promotions, and other marketing messages, and to analyze visits to this and other Web sites. To do this, such third-party providers may collect anonymous data through the use of cookies, beacons, and by other means. Merriam-Webster does not permit any of these companies to collect personally identifiable information about visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine using cookies or beacons or any other means. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from visitors or the method used by such third parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies and beacons). If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted ads, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

Merriam-Webster's ad server, AdTech, uses cookies to prevent you from seeing the same ad too many times. You can opt out of Ad Tech cookies by following this link: <http://www.adtechus.com/privacy/>

Merriam-Webster works with several ad networks that use cookies or beacons to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. The cookies and beacons of many networks, including Collective Media, can be opted out of on the NAI site above. Others can be opted out of through the links below:
