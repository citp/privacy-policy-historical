Your use of our Services is governed by our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use). OUR [TERMS OF USE](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use) CONTAIN DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY, A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

## Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. We understand that you are aware of and care about your privacy rights, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Policy sets forth your privacy rights and applies to personal data we may collect: 

  * Through our free, ad-supported website products, services and platforms;
  * Through our free, ad-supported and subscription-based mobile applications (apps);
  * Through emails and other electronic communications between you and us (with your consent, where required by law); and
  * Through any software provided on or in connection with our website products, services and platforms, apps, and emails (collectively, the Services).



Your decision to use the Services and provide your personal data is voluntary. We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of personal data are requested. You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy) and Your Rights & Choices below for more information), but that may limit the services Merriam-Webster is able to provide to you.

The Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect personal data from, minors under 16 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide personal data through the Services.Please see COPPA Compliance below for more information.

We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies.

## Cookie Notice & [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy)

Our Services use cookies, which are small data files that are placed on the hard drive of your computer, tablet, smartphone, or other devices when you visit a website and other tracking tools on our website and digital platforms. When we refer to cookies, this includes other similar technologies such as pixel tags, or web beacons. For more information about these tools and your choices, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy), Use of Our Services - Information Collected Automatically & Other Information and Your Rights & Choices below.

## COPPA Compliance

In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, personally identifiable information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age without the consent of their educational institution or the child's parent or guardian. We do, however, use COPPA-compliant, third party services that automatically collect or share certain information and usage data with us to support our internal operations as described under How we use your information and Puku third-party service providers below.

If an educational institution with students that are under thirteen (13) years of age uses our [Merriam-Webster Unabridged](http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/) Service, the educational institution also may provide us with personally identifiable information about its students. We use student information to provide this Service to the educational institution and its students, consistent with our Merriam-Webster Unabridged [Privacy Notice.](http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/info/privacy-policy.html)

If you believe that we have collected personal information from someone under the age of 13, please contact us at: [privacy@m-w.com](mailto:privacy@m-w.com).

## How We Collect & Use Your Personal Information

Personal information provided by you to us will not be posted or published by us for viewing by third parties. In most cases, the information you provide is limited to first name, last name, email address, city, state, age, and phone number. We use this information to provide you with goods and services, including subscription services, publications, and the like. We do not sell personal information to anyone and only share it with third parties who are facilitating the delivery of our Services as provided in this Privacy Policy. You can enjoy many of our Services and their unique features without giving us your personal information.

  * #### Subscriptions, User Login Registrations, and Mobile App Services

When you subscribe to or register for a Service or download a mobile app service, we collect information about you that may include (but not be limited to) your name, email address, city, state, and age. We may also collect a personal mailing address and a phone number. Users may edit their information at any time to change, add or remove certain personal information. We process your personal information to administer and manage your subscription or other-like Service, deliver user benefits to you, inform you of prizes and other benefits or opportunities associated with your Service and respond to your information requests. We also may use this information for legitimate business purposes that help us analyze the demographics of our subscribers and understand our users' needs and interests to better tailor our products and services to meet users' needs and deliver additional services to our users.

You may edit this information at any time to change, add or remove it from our Services.

To register for or subscribe to receive a Merriam-Webster newsletter, you must provide us with your email address. We use [Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/), a third-party service provider, to deliver requested newsletters, such as Word of the Day, to you on our behalf. When you open an email that contains a newsletter, we gather certain statistics, such as number of emails opened and clicks within a newsletter, using industry-standard technologies, including clear gifs, helping us monitor and improve our newsletters. For more information, please see Marketing Cloud's [Privacy Notice](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/). Except for Marketing Cloud, we do not share your voluntarily provided email address with any third party.

You may manage your Merriam-Webster newsletter subscriptions by subscribing or unsubscribing at any time using the link included in the related email.

    * Special offers and other marketing messages 
      * From us for additional Merriam-Webster and Encyclopædia Britannica (Merriam-Webster's parent company) products and services, and

When you provide us with your personal information, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive special offers from Merriam-Webster or its third-party partners. Also, each special offer will have information available to allow you to "opt-out" if you no longer wish to receive special offers. We may use [Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/) to deliver emails to you on our behalf. When you open an email from us, we may gather certain statistics, such as number of emails opened and clicks within the email, using industry-standard technologies, including clear gifs, helping us monitor and improve our Services. For more information, please see Marketing Cloud's [Privacy Notice](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/). Except for Marketing Cloud, we do not share your voluntarily provided email address with any third party.

  * #### Surveys

We may occasionally conduct online surveys. All surveys are voluntary, and you may decline to participate.

  * #### Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you

As explained above, Merriam-Webster processes your data to provide you with the products and services you have requested or purchased from us, including special features, subscriptions, newsletters, and other content. Sometimes we use third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to your personal information for the sole purpose of providing services to you on our behalf, such as Word of the Day. Also, we may disclose your personal information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.

To carry out these activities, Merriam-Webster may rely on many legal bases to process your personal data, including where:

    * necessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Service and to provide the requested Services to you;
    * necessary for a third party's, or our, legitimate interests;
    * necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to defend legal claims;
    * necessary to protect the public interest or vital interest of others;
    * you have expressly made information public; or
    * you have consented to the processing, which may be revoked at any time.

We also use your data for legitimate business purposes that enable us to refine our products and services to better tailor them to your needs, communicate with you about other products and services offered by Merriam-Webster, secure your personal data, or comply with regulatory and legal obligations.

You can update your personal information and change your marketing preferences at any time by sending an email to [privacy@m-w.com](mailto:privacy@m-w.com).

  * #### Payment card information

You may choose to purchase goods or services from Merriam-Webster using a payment card. Typically, payment card information is provided directly by users, via the Services, into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which the Merriam-Webster subscribes, and Merriam-Webster does not, itself, process or store your card information. We strongly encourage you not to submit this information by email. When Merriam-Webster employees receive payment card information from users by email, fax, phone, or mail, it is entered as instructed and then deleted or destroyed.




## Use of Our Services - Information Collected Automatically & Other Information

Like other commercial websites, Merriam-Webster and our authorized partners use cookies (small files transferred from a website to its users' hard drives or browsers for record-keeping purposes), including strictly necessary, performance, functional, and personalization cookies, software logs, and other similar information gathering technologies throughout our Services to collect certain information automatically and store it in log files to monitor the use of the Services, gather non-personal informational about our users, and for a variety of other legitimate business interests and purposes. This information may include (but is not limited to) internet protocol (IP) addresses, mobile device identifiers, the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, browser type (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), operating system (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), your internet provider (for example, Comcast), and other usage information about your use of our Services, including a history of the pages you view.

We work with DigiTrust to set a cookie (DigiTrust Cookie) in your browser to enable us to collect web-viewing data that includes visits to a Merriam-Webster service and other non-affiliated websites over time.

We also work with third-party analytics providers, ad networks, and advertisers in order to track your online activities over time and across third party websites, apps and devices, by obtaining information through the automated means (including cookies) mentioned above. The information received by us through these automated methods may include (but is not limited to) information about your activities across unrelated websites and mobile applications, information about the possible relationships between different browsers and devices, information that we receive from our third-party service providers, demographic data, information from social media providers, and information about your interests. We may add this information to the data we have already collected through our Services.

Please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy) and Your Rights & Choices below for more information.

  * #### Links to third-party websites

The Services may contain links to other websites or apps that may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, or applications developed and maintained by third parties. These third-party linked services and advertisements may use automated means to collect information about you and your use of these features. Merriam-Webster is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party linked services once you leave the Services, click an advertisement or sign up for a special offer. We urge all users of our Services to follow safe internet practices: Once you leave the Merriam-Webster Services, do not supply personal data to these third-party linked services unless you have verified their security and privacy policies.

  * #### Purposes for processing (using) information collected automatically & other information

We may use and disclose information collected automatically through our Services and other information for any purpose, except if it is considered personal data under applicable law. If we combine information collected automatically with the personal data provided by you, we treat the combined information as personal data and use it only in the manner described above. See Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you above.

On the basis of legitimate interests, we use this information (or combined information) to help us design our Services to better suit our users' needs, to provide and improve our Services, for identification verification, to provide support, for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns, for analytic purposes through tools such as Google Analytics, and to personalize your experience by presenting content, products, and offers tailored to you. This information, along with other information we gather when you login, also can be used to understand use across websites and devices to further improve our Services, and show you advertisements on the Services or other third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests and enable us to offer the Services to you free of charge. We also may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Services, analyze trends, track user movements and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying user preferences.

  *     * #### Relevant content and recommendations

We use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reporting, which is a Google Analytics Advertiser feature that collects and stores standard internet log and user information on our behalf and gathers information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit. This Google Analytics data is not tied to personal information, so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. For our legitimate business interests, we use the data provided by Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reports to develop our services and content around our user demographics, interests, and behavior on our Services. 

We use Heap, Inc. to collect and analyze data about how you interact with our Services. Heap does this by collecting data on what our users are doing, including (but not limited to) what web pages you visit, what you click on, where you are located and what browser you are using. Please see [Heap’s privacy policy](https://heapanalytics.com/privacy).

    * #### Advertising and interest-based, behavioral advertising

In order to provide you with premium content, free-of-charge, DigiTrust and the third-party ad networks and advertisers identified in our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy) help us deliver advertisements to you on the Services. The third-party ad networks and advertisers with whom we work are able to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests. This type of advertising is called interest-based or behavioral advertising. The data collected using the DigiTrust Cookie may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. Please visit [DigiTrust Partners](http://www.digitru.st/participating-companies/) for more information.

Since our Services are provided to you free of charge, we have a legitimate business interest in monetizing the delivery of our premium content to you on the Services through the display of advertising. To the extent required by applicable law or contractual obligations, we obtain your consent before using your information for interest-based, behavioral advertising – please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy).

Merriam-Webster does not provide any personal information to third-party ad networks or advertisers about visitors to the Services, however these third parties may use automated means, such as cookies, to collect information, which may include your IP address, directly from you when you use our Services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you on the Services or other websites or the use of data that you provide directly to such third-party partners; that usage is governed by the third party partner's privacy policy. For information about opting out of interest-based, behaviorial advertising, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy) and Your Rights and Choices below.

## How we respond to “Do Not Track” signals

When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information. If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider. This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Merriam-Webster does not currently respond to DNT signals.

## Children's Privacy

**A note to minors:** If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services, including Puku, or sending any email to us. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible.

Merriam-Webster does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein.

If you wish to confirm that Merriam-Webster is processing your personal data, or have access to the personal data Merriam-Webster may have about you, please contact us at [dpo@m-w.com](mailto:dpo@m-w.com) and request a copy of our Merriam-Webster Subject Access Request Form. Before processing any such requests, we must first verify that it is a valid and lawful request and that you are in fact the data subject for such request. Please allow at least thirty (30) days for a response.

Also, in the unlikely event that Merriam-Webster or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets and will remain subject to our Privacy Policy.
