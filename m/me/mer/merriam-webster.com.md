# Merriam-Webster Online

Merriam-Webster is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to its Web sites. The guidelines below explain some of the steps we have taken to protect the privacy of visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine and its features. 

**Privacy and Personal Information**   
Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine by limiting the collection of personal information. For certain promotions, we may request a voluntary submission of information such as name, e-mail address, city, state, and age. All personally identifiable information collected on Merriam-Webster OnLine is used only by Merriam-Webster staff to track site usage patterns and statistics, for market research, or for prize or information-request fulfillment unless otherwise indicated. Such information will not be posted or published by us, nor will it be provided to third parties without consent. 

Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical or market research purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's users are adults between the ages of 25 and 35. 

This site, Merriam-Webster OnLine, may use the services of an advertising agency for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, the agency may collect anonymous data through the use of cookies or by other means. 

**Cookies**   
We use cookie technology and software logs to monitor the use of Merriam-Webster OnLine and to gather non-personal information about visitors to the site. None of the information we gather in this way can be used to identify any individual who visits the site. These monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance AOL) they use. This information is used for statistical and market research purposes only.

All of the content on Merriam-Webster OnLine is copyrighted by Merriam-Webster, Incorporated, 47 Federal Street, P.O. Box 281, Springfield, MA 01102 and it cannot be redistributed or used for commercial purposes.
