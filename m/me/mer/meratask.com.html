<p style="margin-left:14.2pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt">3.5&nbsp; <u>Third Party Site </u></p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt">This Privacy Policy applies to services that are owned and operated by the Company. The Company does not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or links from within its Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on the Users’ computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from the Users, for which the Company is not responsible or liable. Accordingly, the Company does not make any representations concerning the privacy practices or policies of such third parties or terms of use of such websites, nor does the Company guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of the information, data, text, software, sound, photographs, graphics, videos, messages or other materials available on such websites. The inclusion or exclusion does not imply any endorsement by the Company of the website, the website's provider, or the information on the website. If you decide to visit a third party website linked to the Website, you do this entirely at your own risk. The Company encourages the User to read the privacy policies of that website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.<strong> WHAT is the mode and manner of using the information?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The Company may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire transfer, debit card, cash on delivery, e-Wallets or cheque for Services including but not limited to Services. The Company will collect such User’s credit card number and/or other financial institution information such as bank account numbers and will use that information for the billing and payment processes, including but not limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished solely by the User through the authentication process. User’s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption, thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per current technology. However, the Company provides you an option not to save your payment details. User is advised, however, that internet technology is not full proof or safe and the User should exercise discretion on using the same.</li>
	<li>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User or anyone visits the Website or Application, the Company automatically receives the URL of the site from which anyone visits. The Company also receives the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each User’s computer (or the proxy server a User used to access the World Wide Web), User’s computer operating system and type of web browser the User is using, email patterns, as well as the name of User’s Internet Service Provider (ISP). This information is used to analyze overall trends to help the Company improve its service. The linkage between User’s IP address and User’s personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may share some of the aggregate findings (not the specific data) in anonymized form (i.e., non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic partners, and others in order to help grow its business.</li>
	<li>If you wish to request that we no longer use your information to provide you services or to cancel your End-User Account, contact us through [info@meratask.com]. We will retain your information for as long as your End-User Account with the Services is active and as needed to provide you the Services or for as long as your partnership/ affiliation with the company is active and is needed to provide listing, appointment and other services. We shall not retain such information for longer than is required for the purposes for which the information may lawfully be used or is otherwise required under any other law for the time being in force. After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively, but our use of the anonymized data will be solely for analytic purposes.</li>
	<li>The Company may keep records of electronic communications and telephone calls received and made for making appointments or other purposes for the purpose of administration of Services, customer support, research and development.</li>
	<li>All the Company’s employees and data processors, who have access to, and are associated with the processing of sensitive personal data or information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of every End-Users’ sensitive personal data and information.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <strong>How and to whom is the information shared and disclosed?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The company will share the End-User’s User Information to the extent necessary for providing the Services.</li>
	<li>The Company may share User Information in an aggregated non-personally identifiable manner with its partners and third parties for the purposes set out in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 above. The Company maintains a strict “No-Spam” policy, which means that the Company does not intend to sell, rent or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third party without your consent.</li>
	<li>The Company may also disclose or transfer End-Users’ personal and other information a User provides, to a third party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of the Company or corporation division. Any third party to which the Company transfers or sells its assets to will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that the Users provide to us, in accordance with the Terms of Use.</li>
	<li>To the extent necessary to provide End-Users with the Services the Company may provide their Personal Information to third party contractors who work on behalf of or with the Company to provide End-Users with such Services, to help the Company communicate with End-Users or to maintain the Application and/or Website. Generally these contractors do not have any independent right to share this information, however certain contractors who provide services on the Application, including the providers of online communications services, will have rights to use and disclose the Personal Information collected in connection with the provision of these Services in accordance with their own privacy policies.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. How is the User Information Protected?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The Company has implemented best international market practices and security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that it has under its control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification and unlawful destruction or accidental loss.

	<li>Your Personal Information is maintained by the Company in electronic form on its equipment, and on the equipment of its employees. Such information may also be converted to physical form from time to time. The Company takes all necessary precautions to protect your Personal Information both online and off-line, and implements reasonable security practices and measures including certain managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures that are commensurate with respect to the information being collected and the nature of the Company’s business.</li>

	<li>The Company makes all User information accessible to its employees, agents or partners and third parties only on a need-to-know basis, and binds all such employees to strict confidentiality obligations.</li>
	<li>Notwithstanding the above, the Company is not responsible for the confidentiality, security or distribution of your Personal Information by our partners and third parties outside the scope of our agreement with such partners and third parties. Further, the Company shall not be responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties or events that are beyond the reasonable control of the Company including, acts of government, computer hacking, unauthorised access to computer data and storage device, computer crashes, breach of security and encryption, poor quality of Internet service or telephone service of the User etc.</li>
