<p>4.<strong>&nbsp;WHAT  is the mode and manner of using the information?</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>The       Company may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire transfer,       debit card, cash on delivery, e-Wallets or cheque for Services including       but not limited to Services. The Company will collect such User’s credit       card number and/or other financial institution information such as bank       account numbers and will use that information for the billing and payment       processes, including but not limited to the use and disclosure of such       credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to       complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information,       however, is accomplished solely by the User through the authentication       process. User’s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure       sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption,       thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per current       technology. However, the Company provides you an option not to save your       payment details. User is advised, however, that internet technology is not       full proof or safe and the User should exercise discretion on using the       same.</li>
  <li>Due       to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User or anyone       visits the Website or Application, the Company automatically receives the       URL of the site from which anyone visits. The Company also receives the       Internet Protocol (IP) address of each User’s computer (or the proxy       server a User used to access the World Wide Web), User’s computer       operating system and type of web browser the User is using, email       patterns, as well as the name of User’s Internet Service Provider (ISP).       This information is used to analyze overall trends to help the Company       improve its service. The linkage between User’s IP address and User’s       personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties.       Notwithstanding the above, the Company may share some of the aggregate       findings (not the specific data) in anonymized form (i.e., non-personally       identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic partners,       and others in order to help grow its business.</li>
  <li>If       you wish to request that we no longer use your information to provide you       services or to cancel your End-User Account, contact us through       [info@meratask.com]. We will retain your information for as long as your       End-User Account with the Services is active and as needed to provide you       the Services or for as long as your partnership/ affiliation with the       company is active and is needed to provide listing, appointment and other       services. We shall not retain such information for longer than is required       for the purposes for which the information may lawfully be used or is       otherwise required under any other law for the time being in force. After       a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may       be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services       effectively, but our use of the anonymized data will be solely for       analytic purposes.</li>
  <li>The       Company may keep records of electronic communications and telephone calls       received and made for making appointments or other purposes for the       purpose of administration of Services, customer support, research and       development.</li>
  <li>All       the Company’s employees and data processors, who have access to, and are       associated with the processing of sensitive personal data or information,       are obliged to respect the confidentiality of every End-Users’ sensitive       personal data and information.</li>
</ol>
<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>How  and to whom is the information shared and disclosed?</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>The       company will share the End-User’s User Information to the extent necessary       for providing the Services.</li>
  <li>The       Company may share User Information in an aggregated non-personally       identifiable manner with its partners and third parties for the purposes       set out in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 above. The Company maintains a strict       “No-Spam” policy, which means that the Company does not intend to sell,       rent or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third party without your       consent.</li>
  <li>The       Company may also disclose or transfer End-Users’ personal and other       information a User provides, to a third party as part of reorganization or       a sale of the assets of the Company or corporation division. Any third       party to which the Company transfers or sells its assets to will have the       right to continue to use the personal and other information that the Users       provide to us, in accordance with the Terms of Use.</li>
  <li>To       the extent necessary to provide End-Users with the Services the Company       may provide their Personal Information to third party contractors who work       on behalf of or with the Company to provide End-Users with such Services,       to help the Company communicate with End-Users or to maintain the Application       and/or Website. Generally these contractors do not have any independent       right to share this information, however certain contractors who provide       services on the Application, including the providers of online       communications services, will have rights to use and disclose the Personal       Information collected in connection with the provision of these Services       in accordance with their own privacy policies.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6. How is  the User Information Protected?</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>The       Company has implemented best international market practices and security       policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that       it has under its control from unauthorized access, improper use or       disclosure, unauthorized modification and unlawful destruction or       accidental loss. However, for any data loss or theft due to unauthorized       access to the User’s electronic devices through which the User avails the       services including the Services listed in the Terms of Use, the Company       shall not be held liable for any loss whatsoever incurred by the User.</li>
  <li>The       Company implements reasonable security practices and procedures and has a       comprehensive documented information security programme and information       security policies that contain managerial, technical, operational and       physical security control measures that are commensurate with respect to       the information being collected and the nature of the Company’s business.       The reasonable security practices and procedures implemented by the       Company include but are not limited to: encrypting data when it is on the       move using industry standard practices, keeping all the data within       private cloud, regularly changing production keys and password, secure and       very limited access to all production servers, performing regular security       updates on our servers and more.</li>
  <li>The       Company takes your right to privacy very seriously and other than as       specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, will only disclose your       Personal Information in the event it is required to do so by law, rule,       regulation, law enforcement agency, governmental official, legal authority       or similar requirements or when the Company, in its sole discretion, deems       it necessary in order to protect its rights or the rights of others, to       prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud and credit risk, or to       enforce or apply the Terms of Use.</li>
  <li>Your       Personal Information is maintained by the Company in electronic form on       its equipment, and on the equipment of its employees. Such information may       also be converted to physical form from time to time. The Company takes all       necessary precautions to protect your Personal Information both online and       off-line, and implements reasonable security practices and measures       including certain managerial, technical, operational and physical security       control measures that are commensurate with respect to the information       being collected and the nature of the Company’s business.</li>
  <li>It       is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your       password, your computer and your mobile phone. The Company does not       undertake any liability for any un-authorised use of your login to Meratask       including Account and password.
