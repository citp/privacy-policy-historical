    <em><strong>How can I change or update the information I provide through the Profile?</strong></em>
    <p>

      The Profile may use cookies, however Merit Pages, Inc. will only use cookies to facilitate functions of the Profile and to analyze Profile usage and will not record or store any information about your movements on the Internet outside of your use of the Profile.

    <p>
      Information you submit to Merit Pages, Inc. upon registration for specific services is password-protected so that the only parties who have access to the information besides Merit Pages, Inc. and its agents and affiliates are you and those you provide that information to. In order to protect the integrity of the password system, members and profile users should refrain from disclosing passwords and immediately change any passwords that may have been compromised. Merit Pages, Inc. will never ask you for your password by e-mail, so members and their employees should not respond to unsolicited e-mail requests asking for password information even if such requests appear to be from Merit Pages, Inc..
