	LightSpeed Retail USA, Inc. d/b/a LightSpeed (“LightSpeed”, “We”, or “Us”) has established this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain to users how their information is collected and used. This Privacy Policy may be updated by LightSpeed from time to time. LightSpeed will provide notice of materially significant changes to this Privacy Policy by posting notice on the main LightSpeed site (www.lightspeedretail.com ). BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES SET OUT IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE APPLICABLE TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT.
</p>
<h3>
	Information We Collect
</h3>
<p>
	For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer’s domain name and e-mail address (where possible).
</p>
<p>
	We collect the domain name and e-mail address (where possible) of visitors to our Web page, the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to our bulletin board, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, the e-mail addresses of those who make postings to our chat areas, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations, name and address, telephone number, payment information (e.g., credit card number and billing address). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page, used to notify consumers about updates to our Web site, and used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>We may use “persistent state” files ("cookies", "flash local storage", "HTML5 local storage", etc. - collectively "persistent cookies") to collect information on our websites. Persistent cookies are data that we transfer to your computer's storage system(s) for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to our Services. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by visitors and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Services. We may use third party services including, but not limited to, Google Analytics, to help understand your use of our Services. These services collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address, and their use of this information is governed by their Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>We anonymously aggregate user data to understand and report on geographic areas of activity (e.g. top cities). In the future we may also anonymously aggregate user-generated content and present this data to our user community. We may use this information to create market trend reports that can be used by our users, their clients and the market at large. We will use this information to develop the product and improve service to our users. We may use this information to market the services of LightSpeed to prospective clients.
</p>
<p>
	The Services are not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Children aged 13 or older should not submit any personal information without the permission of their parents or guardians. By using the Website and our related services, you are representing that you are at least 18.
</p>
<h3>
	Use of Information and Disclosure
</h3>
<p>
	A small number of LightSpeed employees and contractors have access to your information for the purposes of running our computer systems, providing technical support and other operations. We may participate in advertising that individually identifies you by name. LightSpeed offers you a means to choose how we use the contact information you provide. You may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of the our marketing emails. Additionally, you may send a request specifying your communications preferences to [info@lightspeedretail.com]. If, at any time after registering, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request specifying your new choice using the contact method specified herein.
</p>
<p>
	We may also share your information with our authorized service providers, companies that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analyses, supporting the website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features we offer. These service providers may have access to your Content to the extent necessary to perform their functions, but we do not allow them to share or use any of your Content for any other purpose.
</p>
<h4>
	We may also disclose your personal information:
</h4>
<ul>
	<li>in response to a subpoena, court order, investigative demand, or request for cooperation by law enforcement, legal authorities, or government agencies;
	</li>
	<li>to enforce our Terms and Conditions or policies;
	</li>
	<li>to defend ourselves against legal claims, or exercise our legal rights;
	</li>
	<li>to prevent, investigate, or take action against illegal activity, fraud, suspected fraud, or violation of our Terms and Conditions;
	</li>
	<li>to defend our employees, our company, our safety, or our users;
	</li>
	<li>in connection with the sale of our business, a merger, acquisition, consolidation, proprietary information sale, asset sale or large corporate transaction; or
	</li>
	<li>in the event of our filing for bankruptcy.
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Foreign Transfers
</h3>
<p>
	Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, LightSpeed may transfer your information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
</p>
<h3>
	Third Party Sites
</h3>
<p>
	Our Services may contain links to, and may allow you to visit, other websites ("Third Party Sites"). If you choose to visit any of these Third Party Sites by "clicking on" another third party link or navigating to a Third Party Site, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
