# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Whisky + Sunshine takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes what personal information we collect and how we use it. We hate when websites collect our info in scammy ways and then use it or sell it. We will NEVER do that. We won't use it to contact you or spam you except in the manner in which we initially agreed to. It's a pet peeve of ours, it's usually illegal, and we won't do it to you.

### Routine Information Collection
