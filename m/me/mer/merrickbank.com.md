**_PRIVACY POLICY:_ **

Protecting customers' privacy is important to Merrick Bank. In order to help you understand what information we collect and how we use it, we have implemented this privacy policy. 

**What Information We Collect**  
We may collect "nonpublic personal information" about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you, including information you provide on applications or other loan or account forms;
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others; and
  * Information we receive from third parties, such as our affiliates or credit bureaus.



"Nonpublic personal information" is information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. For example, nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account balance and payment history. 

**What Information We Disclose**  
We may disclose all of the information that we collect about you and our former customers, as described above. 

We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you and our former customers to the following types of "affiliates" (i.e., companies related to us by common control or ownership) and "nonaffiliated third parties" (i.e., third parties that are not members of our corporate family): 

  * Affiliates of Merrick Bank Corporation and its parent, CardWorks, L.P.;
  * Financial service providers such as VISA USA, Inc., MasterCard International, Inc., other banks and financial institutions, and insurance companies; and
  * Non-financial companies, such as retailers, direct marketers, marketing partners, and others.



If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you (and your authorized user or co-account holder, if applicable) or with respect to your account to such nonaffiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). If you wish to wish to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties, you may do so by completing the online [Opt Out form](https://applymerrick.com/optout/optout.tcl). **Please note that we are unable to process requests without an account number.**

In addition, we may disclose the following information to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements: 

  * Information we receive from you, including information you provide on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, social security number, assets and income;
  * Information about transactions with us, our affiliates or others, such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions and credit card usage; and 
  * Information we receive from credit bureaus, such as your creditworthiness and your payment history.



We also are permitted under law to share information about our experience or transactions with you or your account (such as your account balance and your payment history with us) with our affiliates. We also may share additional information about your account (such as information we receive from you in applications and information from credit reporting agencies) with our affiliates. You may direct us not to disclose to our affiliates information that does not relate solely to our or our affiliates' experiences or transactions with you (and your co-account holder or authorized user) or your account by completing the [Opt Out form](https://<%=\[vt_get_vhost_name_from_alias applymerrick\]%>/optout/optout.tcl).

We also are permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal information about you to "nonaffiliated third parties" in certain other circumstances. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to third parties to assist us in processing your application with us, to government entities in response to subpoenas, and to credit reporting agencies.

If you decide to close your account or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice. 

**Security Procedures:**  
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know the information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in accordance with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. See _[Internet Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/security.tcl#Internet_Privacy_Policy)_ or _[Internet Security](https://web.archive.org/security.tcl#Internet_Security)_ for more information.
