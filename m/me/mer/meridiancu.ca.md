# Meridian Credit Union - Privacy

## Our Commitment to Privacy 

Credit Unions in Canada have a long history of respecting the rights of their members. As a co-operative financial institution, Meridian Credit Union is committed to the development of policies, procedures and service offerings that maintain these rights.  
While this means the extension of more efficient and flexible member service, we are doing even more to protect your privacy and your right to control the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

Meridian Credit Union has adopted the Credit Union Code for the Protection of Personal Information, related Policies and Procedures, and appointed a Privacy Officer. You are entitled to review the Code at any time, access your personal information, or contact the Privacy Officer through our Contact Centre about a privacy issue or concern. Through these actions, what has been our accepted practice becomes our documented commitment to you, the Member.

## Your Personal Information

We hold personal information about Members to help us meet and maintain the highest standards of financial service. This information can include your name, address, age, income, use of accounts and credit history, as well as the relationship of others linked to you in account services.We obtain this information from you directly, and from the product and service arrangements you have made with or through us. Information is also obtained with your permission from credit bureaus, other financial institutions and from the references you provide us.

## How we typically use your information

With your consent, we typically collect, use, and disclose to others your Personal Information for the following purposes, some of which are necessary (Part A) to enable us to provide you with some or all of the Credit Union's services, and some of which are optional (Part B):

### Part A:

  * To understand your needs and to develop, offer and manage products and services that meet those needs, and to provide the services you have requested from us.
  * To determine the suitability of, and your eligibility for, member products and services;
  * To give it to others with whom we have contracted to help us deliver our products and services to you, but only as needed for providing the services you have requested from us;
  * To evaluate your credit standing, where applicable, and to share or exchange reports and information with credit reporting agencies and other financial institutions, and, with your specific consent, other parties.
  * To detect and prevent fraud, and to help safeguard the financial interests of the credit union and its members.
  * To meet legal and regulatory requirements.



### Part B:

  * To promote to you our services that you have not yet requested but which might interest you.
  * To share it with other companies with whom the credit union has a business relationship, to enable them to market their services to you directly (i.e. Members of the Co-operative Financial Services Group).



The companies with whom we have a business relationship with change over time. Our Branch staff can provide you a current list of all the members of our Co-operative Financial Services Group upon request. We cannot provide you with some or all of our financial services unless you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information for the purposes described in Part A above. For example, in relation to deposit services, Meridian Credit Union Limited is required by law to provide a record of your interest earning information to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. Your consent for the purposes described in Part B is completely at your option, and if you refuse consent for these purposes, you will not be refused credit or other services just because you tell us not to use your Personal Information for these purposes.

**ACCOUNTABILITY**. We have designated a Privacy Officer who is accountable for our compliance with the principles of the Code.

**IDENTIFYING PURPOSES**. Before or at the time we ask you for personal information, we will identify the purposes for which it will be used or disclosed.

**CONSENT.** We require your knowledge and consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information.

**LIMITING COLLECTION**. The collection of personal information is limited to only the purposes we've identified to you.

**LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE, AND RETENTION**. We will only use or disclose your personal information with your consent (or as required by law). And we will only retain your information as long as necessary to fulfill identified purposes.

**ACCURACY**. We will keep your information accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

**SAFEGUARDS**. We will protect your personal information with appropriate security safeguards.

**OPENNESS**. We will make specific, understandable information readily available to you about our personal information policies and practices.

**INDIVIDUAL ACCESS**. When you request it, we will give you access to the existence, use, and disclosure of your information. You are entitled to question its accuracy and completeness, and its uses.

**CHALLENGING COMPLIANCE**. You are entitled to question the Privacy Officer about our compliance with any of these principles.

Meridian's Privacy Officer is your point of contact if you wish to raise any matters regarding the use of your personal information.

The Privacy Officer is responsible for monitoring information collection and data security and ensures that other Meridian Credit Union staff receive appropriate training on privacy issues and their responsibilities under the Code. The Privacy Officer also handles all privacy inquiries and personal information access requests under the Code.

Ultimate responsibility for our compliance with the Code, rests, however, with Meridian Credit Union's Board of Directors.
