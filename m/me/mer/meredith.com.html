            about the safety of children. Kids under 13 are not allowed to register 
            with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our 
            sites. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any 
            personally identifying information. Children should always get permission 
            from their parents before sending any information about themselves 
            (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the 
            Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved 
            in your children's online experience, and to share your interest in 
            our sites with your young ones.</font></p>

            We Collect:</b></a><br>
            </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information we 
            gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1) information you 
            supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking 
            information collected as you navigate through our sites. Third-party 
            providers featured on or linked to by our websites, such as vendors 
            of products and services offered through our sites, may gather the 
            same kinds of information.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Personally Identifiable 
            Information</u></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To use certain features 
            on our sites, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect 
            personally identifiable information about you including your name, 
            mailing address, email address, user name and password. We may also 
            ask for some additional information, for example, hobbies, age, browser 
            type, and the like, but you're free to register without providing 
            this information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points 
            on our sites, we may ask you for personal information including when 
            you: place an order for products, complete a survey, and report a 
            problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process 
            your orders and to help improve our sites.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From time to time, we also 
            may offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising 
            partners. If you choose to participate in one of these contests or 
            promotions, you'll have to provide some information about yourself 
            (such as name, address, and email address). We may share this information 
            with co-sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners, but 
            we will always identify the other parties involved (for example, in 
            the contest rules). We don't control these third parties' privacy 
            practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection 
            and use of personal information. We urge you to review their privacy 
            policies and learn how they will use the information before participating. 
            If you don't want us to collect the information requested in the promotion, 
            or to provide it to our cosponsors or partners, please do not participate 
            in the promotion.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Aggregate Information</u></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To help us serve your needs 
            better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes to track 
            user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent 
            to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard 
            drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our sites to 
            identify your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track 
            of your user name and password (if you are a registered visitor) so 
            you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit our 
            site. We also use cookies to make sure you don't see the same ads 
            repeatedly when you visit our sites. The help function on most browsers 
            contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before 
            accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you 
            don't accept cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of various 
            features on our sites that are available to other visitors. In addition, 
            our advertising and marketing partners may use their own cookies. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We use the services of 
            a third-party advertising and email delivery company to serve and 
            target advertisements that you see on the pages of our sites and to 
            serve and target promotions or other marketing messages and to sende-mails 
            from us. This advertising company also collects "clickstream data," 
            information about your visit to our site and to other sites, that 
            can be aggregated and used to target advertising on this and other 
            sites, and used for marketing research and other similar purposes. 
            This clickstream data does not include personally identifying information 
            such as your name, address, email address or telephone number. This 
            advertising company uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, 
            and collects information directly from our users. We share web site 
            usage information about visitors to our web site, who have received 
            a targeted promotional campaign, with this advertising company for 
            the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information 
            used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party 
            advertising company note some of the pages you visit on our web site 
            through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). If you would 
            like to know more about its information gathering practice and "opt-out" 
            procedures, please see the privacy statement on the DoubleClick website 
            (<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;</a>).

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you use our sites, 
            we may also collect your browser type, access time, and/or Internet 
            Protocol ("IP") address, and keep records of this information. 
            Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to 
            the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web 
            pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell 
            us who you are. Like the IP address, none of this other information 
            identifies you personally either; we collect it for aggregate reporting 
            on site activity that we, and our advertisers, may use. For example, 
            we may want to know how long the average user spends on our site, 
            which pages or features get the most attention, and the like. The 
            aggregate information helps to understand our audience and confirm 
            the value of advertising on our websites.</font></p>

            when visiting our sites and to make our sites more valuable to you. 
            We try to ensure that the banner advertisements we deliver to you 
            are consistent with your interests. We may also email you with messages 
            and advertising that we think may be of interest to you.</font> </p>

            promotion</i>. For example, we will provide your name and email address 
            to a marketing partner from which you're purchasing goods or services. 
            We also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to 
            products and services offered by third-parties, whose privacy policies 
            we don't control. When you access another website or purchase products

            provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those

            the transaction. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours.

            via a link either from the site's homepage or from the pages on which
