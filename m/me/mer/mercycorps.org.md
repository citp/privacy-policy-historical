Our goal at Mercy Corps is to extend trust and respect to you. We are committed to respecting the privacy rights of all donors and visitors to our website. The following information details Mercy Corps' collection, protection, and use of the data we receive from donors and visitors to this website.

**Email Updates**

Email updates provide a worldwide perspective on the Mercy Corps mission to alleviate suffering, poverty, and oppression around the globe. In order to receive these updates you must provide Mercy Corps with your name and email address. This information will be held in complete confidence, and we will NOT sell, rent or trade this information to a third party. You will be given the option to remove your name from our email list at the bottom of each email update. Or, you can [click here](http://newsletter.mercycorps.org/) to update your information. You will need to enter a username and password to access this information.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

**Online Donations**

Your online donations are safe and secure. Mercy Corps uses industry-standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect the confidentiality of your personal information and the security of your transaction. Our donations are processed through a 3rd-party service, Charity Web, which is a VeriSign-authorized vendor. At this time, we do not use PayPal.

Our goal is to forge a long-term partnership with you, and we value and appreciate the trust that accompanies your online donation. If you donate online, your information will never be sold or rented to a third party (see exception below in "Donations by Mail").

To serve you better, we may contact you in the future to inform you about Mercy Corps' response to the needs of the world's suffering people. We will offer various contact options, so you can choose how often you hear from us. Mercy Corps will remove your name from our mailing list, email list or telephone solicitation list at any time, at your request.

Mercy Corps uses the services of outside vendors to send our email newsletters and to complete the online donation process. These vendors adhere to Mercy Corps' commitment to privacy and security. However, if you should have a concern, please contact us directly, and we will do our utmost to correct the problem.

**Donations by Mail**

In order to increase our base of support and keep our costs low, Mercy Corps sometimes exchanges a segment of our mailing list with other carefully selected organizations. Donors who make their first gift to Mercy Corps in response to an appeal letter may be included on this exchange list; all other donors are automatically excluded from the exchange. All donors who made their first gift to Mercy Corps before January 31, 2004 are also excluded from the exchange. At least once a year, we will inform all donors who are eligible to be included on the exchange list, and give them an opportunity to opt out of future exchanges. Donors who wish to have their names removed from the exchange list can call 1-800-292-3355 ext. 250 or email donorservices@mercycorps.org.

**Contact Mercy Corps**

Thank you for your interest in Mercy Corps and our privacy policy. If you would like more information about the options discussed herein or simply have questions, please feel free to contact us via email at donorservices@mercycorps.org, or speak to a Donor Services Representative at 800.292.3355 x 250.
