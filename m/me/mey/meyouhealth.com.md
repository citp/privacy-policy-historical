# MeYou Health - Privacy Policy

### **Privacy MeYou Health — Privacy Policy**

#### **Privacy Policy**

Welcome to the MeYou Health, LLC ("MeYou Health") website available at "www.meyouhealth.com" (this "Site"). This Statement discloses the Privacy Policy (this "Policy") for this Site and describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from visitors to our Site. MeYou Health has created this Policy in order to demonstrate and inform you of our firm commitment to privacy. This Policy applies only to information collected through this Site and not to information collected offline or through any other websites, web or mobile applications (even if affiliated with MeYou Health).

Last updated and effective as of March 1, 2010.

### **THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

There are two kinds of information websites can obtain about you: 

_(1) Anonymous Information:_ "Anonymous Information" is aggregate data that websites use to administer their sites. It may include such information as your browser type or your Internet Protocol (IP) address. MeYou Health may from time to time retain third parties to help us collect and aggregate Site customer information. 

**IP Addresses.** An IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site, avoid hacking attacks on the Site's server, and may use it to gather broad demographic, geographic, and industry information. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, even if such information is voluntarily provided by a user. 

**Cookie Information**. As is the case with many websites, our Site uses a technology called "cookies", which are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and allows us to tailor your visits to our Site to your individual preferences. We may also contract with third party service providers who assign cookies and/or web beacons to conduct site tracking for us. These companies use cookies solely to provide us with aggregate data about Site traffic. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser to prevent cookies or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on our Site. 

_(2) Personally Identifiable Information:_ "Personally Identifiable Information" is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or your telephone number. Sometimes this personal information is needed when you submit a resume or when you contact us. We may ask you to provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of our Site. In particular, you may be asked to provide the following information:

**Email address or other contact information**. We may ask you to provide an email address or other contact information so that we may contact you about future product offerings, opportunities to help us test new products or to comment on our work, make a complaint, make suggestions or ask questions. MeYou Health may store this information, but does not share, sell, license or transmit this information with third parties without express authorization from you. 

### **HOW WE USE GATHERED INFORMATION**

The information you share with us may be used in a few ways:

_(1) Anonymous Information_ : Anonymous Information is used internally for Site administration, troubleshooting and to help improve the quality of this Site and its design. We may share such aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, such as demographics, with existing and prospective business partners and advertisers. We never connect aggregate information with Personally Identifiable Information, and none of the Anonymous Information we share will contain any information that identifies you individually.

_(2) Personally Identifiable Information:_ Personally Identifiable Information collected by MeYou Health may be used for purposes including administration of the Site and communications with you. In all cases, however, we will only use your information as permitted by law and our customer contracts. In addition, we may from time to time contract with third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing our customer information. In such instances, we advise these companies not to retain, store, share, or use Personally Identifiable Information for any secondary purposes. We also may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. 

### **OPT-OUT**

We support the right of our visitors to choose. You will be given the right to opt-out of receiving any promotional materials about MeYou Health whenever you are asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information on this Site. If you do not opt-out at that time, but later decide that you do not wish to receive future communications of this nature you can contact us at support@meyouhealth.com or at the address provided below, indicating that you no longer want to receive information relating to this Site.

### **ACCESS AND CORRECTION**

You have certain rights to know about the Personally Identifiable Information that MeYou Health holds about you and gathered through this Site, including the right to correct, amend or delete the information that MeYou Health has on file if it is incorrect. If you wish to exercise these rights please contact us by email or postal mail at the addresses below.

### **SECURITY**

This Site incorporates safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of the personal information we have collected. We have put in place reasonable precautions to protect information from loss, misuse and alteration, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and database encryption when appropriate. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just "surfing".

Security of information communicated by or to us over the Internet is of utmost concern to us; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that your email, like most, if not all, non-encrypted Internet communications, may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, MeYou Health cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through this Site. Once we receive your transmission, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the numbers provided throughout our Site.

### **DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION THROUGH BUSINESS TRANSFERS**

As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or substantially all of MeYou Health's assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including Personally Identifiable Information) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. 

### **OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") defines a "Child" as anyone under the age of 13. MeYou Health strictly adheres to COPPA. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information obtained through our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### **EXTERNAL LINKS**

This Site may provide links to various websites that we do not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of our Site and connected to the website of the organization or company that you selected. We are not responsible for the nature, quality or accuracy of the content or opinions expressed on such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for quality, accuracy or completeness by us. Inclusion of any linked website on this Site does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked website by us, or of any of the content, opinions, products or services provided on these websites. Even if an affiliation exists between our Site and a third-party website, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. While MeYou Health expects its partners and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users, MeYou Health cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. If you visit a website that is linked to from our Site, we encourage you to consult that website's privacy policy before providing any personal information and whenever interacting with any website. 

### **CONSENT AND MODIFICATIONS TO PRIVACY STATEMENT**

This Site is controlled, operated and administered entirely within the United States. By using this Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not disclose any personal information through this Site. This Policy and the use of this Site are governed by Tennessee law, where our parent company, Healthways, Inc., is headquartered. Any claim related to the Site or this Policy shall be brought in a federal or state court in Nashville, Tennessee, within one year after the claim arises. Users of the Site consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts as the most convenient and appropriate for the resolution of disputes concerning this Policy. This Policy and the notices outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any third party. 

### **SPECIAL NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS**

Under the California Civil Code, residents of the State of California that have provided any Personally Identifiable Information to MeYou Health have the right to request a list of all third parties to which MeYou Health has disclosed Personally Identifiable Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if MeYou Health has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of Personally Identifiable Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, MeYou Health may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. MeYou Health qualifies for the alternative option; it has established this Policy that provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. 

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request to support@meyouhealth.com with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent.

### **MODIFICATIONS TO PRIVACY POLICY**

MeYou Health may modify this Policy at any time, at its discretion, and modifications are effective upon being posted on this Site. You are responsible for reviewing this Policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes to it. 

### **ACCOUNT REVISIONS, REVOKING AND DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We welcome your questions, comments and all feedback pertaining to your privacy or any other issue with regard to this Site. 

At any time, you may ask us to cease further use of your email address to send you correspondence, and direct us to delete any Personally Identifiable Information you have supplied. Although it is not always possible to remove or modify such information, we will make reasonable efforts to do so. If you have given us information for one of those third parties we mentioned above and we have already passed it on, we may not be able to delete or change the information. 

In the event that you have given us Personally Identifiable Information in the past and then have second thoughts or want to update it, or if you have any other questions regarding this Policy or this Site, you may contact us at: ****
