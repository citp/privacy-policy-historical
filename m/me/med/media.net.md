# Media.net

Media.Net Advertising Ltd., including our affiliates and subsidiaries, (individually and/or collectively, "Media.Net," "we," "us" or "our") makes available the website located on the Internet at uniform resource locator (URL) [http://www.media.net/](http://media.net/) ("Website"). We utilize our ad serving technology (our "Technology") to generate and present targeted advertising on behalf of the advertisers and publishers participating in our advertising network (our "Partners"). This Privacy Policy describes the kinds of information we collect about consumers ("you" or "your") on sites operated by our Partners that use our Technology ("Partner Sites") and how we use and share that information.

### NAI Membership

We are a member of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and are in compliance with the NAI's Code of Conduct. If you would like to learn more about the NAI, please click here [http://networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/).

### Information Collection and Use

Unless you choose to provide it to us, our Technology does not collect any personally identifiable information or sensitive consumer information about you during the ad delivery process. Our Technology does not, for example, collect any social security numbers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, precise real-time geographic location derived through location-based services, nor any specific information about your past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic or family medical history.

While our Technology does not deliver targeted ads based on precise medical conditions or treatments or market prescription drugs, we may generate and serve targeted ads for general health products that do not require a prescription. Examples may include certain health categories like dietary supplements, fitness equipment, weight-loss products, skin-care products etc. For a full list of our health related segments, please [click here](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/asc/details.html).

We only collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your behavior and usage patterns on Partner Sites in connection with ads delivered or served using our Technology. We collect this non-personally identifiable information about you using cookies, web beacons, and other web tools ("Tools"). These Tools allow us to collect information about how you view or interact with these advertisements and connect to other websites. For example, when you visit one of our Partner Sites, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our service. Tools like cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Partner Sites and the links or advertisements you click. These Tools allow us and our Partners to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge the effectiveness of the ads.

Specifically, we may collect IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, user search data, the content of any undeleted cookies that the browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address. Media.Net uses this information to customize the type of advertisements you see, to conduct research, and to provide anonymous reporting to our Partners. We do not use these Tools to store any personally identifiable information. Please note that we do not have access to or control over the Tools used by third parties on our Website or on any Partner Sites, and this policy does not govern the use of Tools by these third parties.

While we do not collect personally identifiable information or any sensitive consumer information about you, we do collect some personally identifiable information about our Partners and potential Partners through our Website when they request information about our services. This information may include, without limitation, name, title, company, address, email and phone number. This information is used to respond to their requests or questions.

### Information Sharing

We may share the information we collect about you with certain third parties in the following ways:

We may, from time to time, use business partners, operational service providers and subcontractors ("Service Providers") to operate and provide our services to Partners and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Our Service Providers are required to protect the information we provide them in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy, for example, by not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us. Although we exercise care in selecting our Service Providers and require them to protect information as mentioned above, they are independent third parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices.

We may rent, sell, or share aggregated information and other non-personally identifiable information with third parties for multiple reasons, including to develop and deliver targeted advertising and to conduct general business analysis. The non-personally identifiable information that we collect to create segments and profile information for our service may be shared with our Partners. We may combine non-personally identifiable information we collect with additional non-personally identifiable information collected from other sources. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling of your information once it is shared. While we do not collect personally identifiable information about you, by interacting with or viewing an ad, there is a possibility that our Technology and our Partners will make assumptions or infer things about you (or anyone using your devices or browsers) in order to display more relevant ads.

We provide information to third parties for legal process (e.g., in response to a subpoena or civil or criminal investigative demand, court order, or a request from law enforcement or other government agency); to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; to protect the security and integrity of our assets and business operations; or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may disclose your information when we believe it is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Media.Net, our Partners, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the terms of service of our Website or other agreements or policies.

We may also provide information to third parties in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

### Third Parties

This Privacy Policy applies solely to our privacy practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Partners, Service Providers or any third parties, even if our ads contain links to third party websites and even if we have a business relationship with that third party. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit to be sure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to you from each of them.

We may edit, amend, modify, and update our Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time, by posting updated text on or links to our Website. When we make material changes to our Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, we will notify you by posting a notice on our Website. We display the Effective Date at the top of our Privacy Policy so that you will know when there has been a change in its effective date.
