### Information Collection 

Media.net collects and stores personally identifiable information when you provide it to us through our Website - [http://www.media.net](http://www.media.net/) or [http://contextualads.yahoo.net](http://contextualads.yahoo.net/). "Personally identifiable Information" means any information obtained through your use of our Website which might reasonably be used to specifically identify you; which may include your name, title, company, address, email and phone number and any other personal information you choose to provide while using our Website or our ad services. Our ad serving technology does not collect any personally identifiable information about users during the ad delivery process.

We may also collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your and other users' behavior and usage patterns on advertisements and on websites operated by our publisher partners to better customize the type of advertisements you and other users see on various sites. Specifically, we collect the following information:

  * _Log Information_. This is technical information from a user's browser that is automatically collected when users visit our website or Partner Sites managed by our publisher partners. This information includes an IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that the browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address.
  * _Cookies_. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer that tracks non-personal information about the user. When using our website or visiting our Partner Sites, we may assign a user's computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our service. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about activity on our website and Partner Sites, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions conduct by users. The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to disable cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, you will still be able to access our website, but you may not be able to use all of the interactive features we offer.
  * _Web Beacons_. We, or our advertisers or publisher partners, may use standard Internet technology such as web beacons (or "clear gifs"), tracking pixels, and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about user of our website and Partner Sites.
  * _Information collected by third-parties_. We, and our partners, such as publishers and advertisers, may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to other websites. This information allows us, and our partners, to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Please note that we do not have access to or control over third parties' cookies used on our website, and this policy does not govern the use of cookies by these third parties. We may also obtain information about you from third party data gathering sources. We may match this third-party collected information with the personally identifying information that you provide to us.
  * Finally, our ad technology also collects and stores aggregated ad delivery reporting data. This data is used to provide our clients and customers with campaign reporting and is also used for billing purposes.



### Use and Sharing

Media.net uses information it collects to customize the advertising and content viewed by users, to conduct research, and to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

Media.net uses personally identifiable information for legally permissible purposes that include the following:

  * We provide information to trusted partners for business reasons such as in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. If a change in ownership occurs that will result in your personal information being used in a manner different from that stated in the then-existing privacy policy, notification will be provided consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
  * We provide information to third parties for legal process such as in n response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from any law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us in our sole discretion. In addition, we may disclose your information when we believe it is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the terms of service of our Website or other agreements or policies.



Media.net may, from time to time, use subsidiaries and subcontractors in order to operate and provide the ad serving technology to publishers and advertisers and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. If such subsidiaries and subcontractors have access to personally identifiable information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Media.net.

Media.net also uses aggregated and non-personally identifiable information in the following manner:

  * We may rent, sell, or share aggregated information not specifically identifiable to you and other users, and other non-personal information we collect, with third parties for multiple reasons, including to develop and deliver targeted advertising, and to conduct general business analysis. The user information that we collect to create segments and profile information for our service is shared with our contracted customers and not with any other outside party. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling of your information once it is shared.
  * Media.net partners with numerous publishers to provide online advertisements in the form of content-targeted sponsored listings (advertising relevant to the content of a webpage). Content-targeted advertising typically relates to what a user is reading on the page. Some publishers may use our ad serving technology to better understand the effectiveness of certain advertising and the value of the content on the Partner Sites.



Media.net displays targeted advertisements based on personal, contextual, and behavioral information. Media.net does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when a user interacts with or views a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

### Links

Our Partner Sites contains links to other websites, including through advertisements. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party linked websites, even if our ads contain links with third party websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect. Please note that we may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed for aggregating informational purposes.

### Children's Privacy

Our websites and advertising services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information about children under the age of 13. If you believe your child has provided Media.net with personally identifiable data, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us.
