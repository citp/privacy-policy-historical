# HCFA Internet Privacy Policy

 

The privacy of our customers is important to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). We understand that visitors to _**hcfa.gov**_ and _**medicare.gov**_ need to be in control of their personal information.

Therefore, the following is HCFA's Internet Privacy Policy:

  * You do not have to give us personal information to visit our sites. If you choose not to provide personal information, you can still visit _**hcfa.gov**_ and _**medicare.gov**_ pages.



### Cookies

  * What is a cookie?  
A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser -- along with a Web page -- when you access a Web site. There are two kinds of cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer's memory. Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive.

**HCFA uses session cookies only. We do not use any persistent cookies.**

  * HCFA's Use of Cookies  
You do not need to have cookies enabled to visit _**hcfa.gov**_ and _**medicare.gov**_.

Cookies are used to remember your "screen reader" viewing preference on **_medicare.gov_**. If you do not have cookies enabled, you will have to choose "Screen Reader Version" on every page you visit. If you do have cookies enabled, your preference will be saved for the entire visit to the site. This preference will not be saved between site visits, however. 

We have set our software so that your browser will only return cookie information to the domain where the cookie originated (in this case, **_hcfa.gov_** or **_medicare.gov_** ). No other site can request it. Note: Regardless of the particular uses for cookies on HCFA web sites, we will not share any cookie information with any third parties.




### Data Collection

  * We may collect personally identifiable information (name, e-mail address, physical address, and other unique identifier) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you.
  * Personally identifying information collected will be used only in connection with _**hcfa.gov**_ and _**medicare.gov**_ , or for such purposes as are described at the point of collection.
  * Information collected is for statistical purposes only. HCFA performs analyses of user behavior in order to measure customer interest in the various areas of our sites. HCFA also uses listservs to send out information and change notices to subscribed users of our sites.
  * HCFA will protect the personal information that you share with us. HCFA does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information to third parties. If we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.



### E-Mail

  * While HCFA will make every attempt to protect the personal information that you share with us, electronic mail is not secure against interception. If your communication is very sensitive, you may want to send it by postal mail instead.



**We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless _you_ choose to provide such information.**
