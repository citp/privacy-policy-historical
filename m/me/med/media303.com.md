# CPA Storm - More Power

It is important that you fully understand what happens to the information we gather from you as a publisher, advertiser or other user of CPA Storm’s website and services. Please read this Privacy Statement carefully to understand how we will use and protect your personal information. 

Collection of Your Personal Information  
Upon registration we will ask a publisher to provide personal information such as name, email address, physical mailing address, phone number, taxpayer ID number, or a faxed copy of a government-issued ID. We may also collect non-personal information, such as your zip code, the amount you spend on advertising, what type of Internet traffic you have (incentive versus non-incentive), or the source of your Internet traffic (web versus email or search). We may use this non-personal data to improve the services and advertising content we provide to you as well as tailor the services provided to you. We may also share this non-personal information with others, such as interested advertisers, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personal information about you or any other person. 

When you receive email from CPA Storm, we may use Web beacons and customized links (or similar technologies) to determine whether the email has been opened and whether you clicked on a link in the email in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.

Sharing of Your Personal Information  
Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent. CPA Storm may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of CPA Storm and our affiliates, both publishers and advertisers. Your personal information and other data may be transferred in connection with a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, insolvency, or asset sale. 

In order to provide our products and services, we may hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as to send email, to perform statistical analysis of our services, to provide affiliate support, to carry out invoicing, or to make payments. These service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to perform their functions. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. 

Our website contains links to the sites of third parties. When you visit these sites, please consult those sites' individual privacy statements in order to determine how they treat user information.

Security  
CPA Storm is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information, such as our accounting department accessing your payment information in order to send you your publisher commission payment. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desks. When they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access. 

A password is used to help protect your account and personal information. It is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone.
