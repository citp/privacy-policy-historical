<h2 class="title">Medpedia Privacy Policy</h2>
  
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 1, 2008, and outlines the types of
information collected by Medpedia as well as steps taken to keep your private information
private. This policy's goal is to help you make an educated decision
when choosing to use the Medpedia Web site and/or share information with the
community.</p>

<h3>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>

<p>This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Medpedia.com Web site at <a href="http://www.medpedia.com/">http://www.medpedia.com/</a> (the
"Site"), and the Medpedia.com services, and covers how
Medpedia treats information that it collects and receives from its users.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Medpedia Terms of Use.
Your use of the Site, the Medpedia services and any information you provide on the Web
Site is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Medpedia Terms of Use.</p>

<h3>What this Privacy Policy doesn't cover</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to Web sites and services that are owned and operated
by Medpedia. Medpedia does not exercise control over other Web sites linked to or from
within the Site. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your
computer, collect data or solicit information from you. You are encouraged to read their
privacy policies before you enter into an exchange with them.</p>

<p>Medpedia may allow other companies to serve advertisements on the Site. These
third-party advertisers use technology to send, directly to your browser, the
advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP
address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies,
JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to
personalize the advertising content to a certain audience.</p>

<p>Sponsors or advertisers on the Site may use their own cookies, web beacons or other
online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the Site and in
emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies
other than Medpedia to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these
companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-personal
information through the use of cookies or web beacons on our Web site. In certain
situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your
browser to the Web site of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the
sponsor, partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected
destination (e.g., back to Medpedia to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this
re-direction process will not be apparent to you. We do not control these third parties'
use of cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they
gather through them. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who
collect cookie or web beacon information through our Web site to agree that they will not
collect any personal information from our site without your consent. They have promised
us they will not link any non-personal cookie or web beacon information collected by them
on our site to personal information they or others collect in other ways or from other
sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program. You should
review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site to understand
how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through
the use of cookies or web beacons on their own sites. Certain Ad Servers allow you to
prevent them from collecting data through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must
opt-out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can opt-out of
cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway
Opt-out site ( <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>).
This website will also allow you to review the Ad Server's privacy policies. You can also
find additional information and resources about how to opt-out of advertising and related
cookies by visiting the World Privacy Forum's Site (<a href="http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/cookieoptout.html">http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/cookieoptout.html</a>).</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to content, business information, ideas, concepts
or inventions that you send to Medpedia by email. If you want to keep content or business
information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an
email to Medpedia.</p>

<h3>The Information Medpedia Collects and How It Is Used</h3>

<h4 class="pad_top">Readers (no registration required)</h4>

<p>You do not need to register for a Medpedia account in order to visit and use the Site.
For these no-registration-required services Medpedia collects the following
information:</p>

<p>Cookies: A cookie is a small file containing a unique string of characters that is
sent from the Medpedia servers and saved by your browser software. Browsers are typically
set to accept cookies, however, you can change the settings on your browser to notify you
when a site is sending a cookie to your browser or, alternatively, to refuse cookies
altogether. The Medpedia Site sets a temporary session cookie on your browser whenever
you visit, and you will not be able to log in to your account if you have set your
browser to deny the session cookie. This temporary cookie is deleted each time you close
your browser session. When you log in, the Medpedia Site sets another cookie on your
browser that remains on your computer up to 30 days so that you don't
have to retype your user name when you return to the Site and log in. You may clear this
log in cookie anytime through your browser settings.</p>

<p>Log information: When you use the Medpedia services, our servers automatically record
the data that your browser sends whenever you visit a Web site. These
"server logs" include data such as browser type, Internet
Protocol address, your Web request, the date and time of your requests, and your Medpedia
cookie(s) that uniquely identify your browser. The log data is used primarily for the Web
site technicians to monitor the health of the Site and solve any technical problems. The
log data can also be used to track down malicious Editors and Members by correlating
their IP address to a username. Examples of malicious activity include harassment,
duplicate accounts, abuse of the system and disruption of the Medpedia service.
Medpedia's policy is not to disclose the log data publicly, but such
data may be shared with third parties in the following cases: a) if it is required to
comply with compulsory requests from law enforcement, b) if it is required to pursue an
investigation of abuse, c) if it is required to resolve technical issues, d) if it is
required to help block certain IP addresses to stop abuse, or e) if it is required to
protect the safety, property, or rights of Medpedia, its users, or the public.</p>

<p>Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Site, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. web
beacons), which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of users without
collecting any personally identifiable information about you.</p>

<p>E-mail Messages: If you send an email to customer service or to a member of the
Medpedia staff we may retain those communications and your email address in order to
reply to your inquiries, fulfill your requests and to improve our services.</p>

<p>We use the non-personal information described above to: (a) remember information so
that you will not have to re-enter it during your current or subsequent visits to the
Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the
effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total
number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) access your
information after you sign in; and (h) market the Site to advertisers and other third
parties.</p>

<h4 class="pad_top">Editors and Members (registration required)</h4>

<p>In order to contribute content to the Site you must register as a Medpedia
"Editor." Medpedia collects the non-personal information
described above from Editors and Members, and in addition, Medpedia collects the
following types of personal information from Editors and Members for the following
purposes (personal information is information that personally identifies you, such as
your name, email address, home address, phone numbers, or other data which can be
reasonably linked to such information):</p>

<p>Information you provide: When you register to become an Editor and Member, Medpedia
asks you for personal information. Examples of that information include your name (or a
pseudonym), email address, birth date, account password, and the profile information
described below. We use the personal information that you provide to respond to your
questions, provide you the specific services you select, send you emails about Site
maintenance and updates, and inform you of significant changes to this Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Profile Information: Editors must disclose in their public profiles their corporate
and academic affiliations and they must disclose if they receive, or expect to receive,
any form of compensation for the content they contribute to Medpedia, or any compensation
related to medicine, medical information, or products and services related to the body.
This is standard practice in the medical field and those policies carry over to the
Medpedia community, and are meant to encourage a "neutral point of
view" with respect to Medpedia contributions.</p>

<p>Your IP Address: In addition to your profile, you may also be identified in the
Medpedia system by your IP address, the numerical address of the location from which you
are connecting to the Site. That IP address may be traceable specifically to your
computer, or it may only be traceable to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use to
access the Internet, depending on what type of connection you have. In either case,
Medpedia will have the ability to link your IP address to your contributions on the site,
which helps to prevent abuse and fraud.</p>

<p>Contributions: When Editors submit content to the Site, that information becomes
publicly available throughout the world via the Site, and each such
"post" will be attached to the Editor's
profile. This material will be stored indefinitely and is always publicly viewable.
Removing content from a Medpedia article does not permanently delete that content. The
features of the Site permit anyone to retrieve a previous version of an article and see
content that was previously deleted. If the article itself is deleted, a copy will
permanently remain on the Medpedia servers and be accessible by Medpedia personnel.</p>

<p>Other Data: In order to maintain an open and transparent community, certain other data
on Editors and Members is made public through "user
contributions" lists and by other users, typically in aggregated form. Such
data might include the times at which an Editor edited content on the Site and the number
of edits they made.</p>

<p>Email: Other Editors and Members may send email to you through the Medpedia service,
however your email address will not be revealed to them unless you respond, or possibly
if their email to you is "bounced" back to them. Medpedia
may use Editors' and Members' email address to
communicate with them periodically. If you subscribe to a mailing list for a project,
your address will be visible to others on the project.</p>

<p>Invitation emails: You may choose to opt-out of Medpedia invitation emails by clicking
the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the invitation email.</p>

<p>Links: Medpedia may present links in a format that lets Medpedia keep track of when
these links are clicked. Medpedia uses this information to improve the quality of
Medpedia services, to estimate traffic Medpedia sends to third party sites, and to
customize content and advertising.</p>

<p>Your contacts: In order to invite others to connect with you directly in Medpedia, you
will enter their names and email addresses. This information will be used by Medpedia to
send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of
people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders.
<strong>You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts on
Medpedia. All information entered as private will only be viewable by you and will not be
searchable by others in the Medpedia network without your permission.</strong> All
information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same
terms of this privacy policy as cover your own personal information.</p>

<h3>Public areas of Medpedia</h3>

<p>The Site includes public areas, such as discussion pages and communities, where you
may post Content and communicate with other Members (the "<u>Public
Areas</u>"). Any information shared (including personal information) that you
reveal in a Public Area is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure
service. You should think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any
Public Area. What you have written may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third
parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including
to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, this
information may also appear in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN
etc.</p>

<h3>When Medpedia May Share Your Information</h3>

<p>Medpedia shares collected information (both personal and non-personal information)
with Medpedia subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons
who process such information on Medpedia's behalf in order for
Medpedia to provide or improve services. Medpedia requires that these parties agree to
process such collected information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and to take
reasonable confidentiality and security measures with respect to such collected
information.</p>

<p>Medpedia operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to your
personal information in the course of providing products or services to Medpedia. These
contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services,
and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site. Unless you have acted
to opt-out of receiving emails and newsletters from Medpedia, these contractors also may
have access to your email address to send newsletters or special promotions to you on our
behalf or to send emails to you for purposes such as conducting market research on our
behalf. Access to your personal information by these contractors is limited to the
information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for
Medpedia. We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors
1) protect the privacy of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy,
and 2) not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing
us with products and services as required by law.</p>

<p>Medpedia shares non-personal information (such as anonymous Web site use data) with
third-parties to assist them in understanding the Site, including usage of the Site and
the services Medpedia provides and the success of advertisements and promotions.</p>

<p>Medpedia may release collected information if required to do so by law, or in the
good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws
(such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. It
may be necessary to share collected information in order to investigate, prevent, or take
action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to,
fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any person,
violations of Medpedia's Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by
law.</p>

<p>Medpedia also reserves the right to disclose collected Information that Medpedia
believes is appropriate or necessary to enforce Medpedia's Terms of
Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any
third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect
the security or integrity of the Site, and to exercise or protect the rights, property,
or personal safety of Medpedia, Medpedia users or others.</p>

<p>In the event that Medpedia is acquired by or merged with a third party entity,
Medpedia reserves the right to transfer or assign the information Medpedia has collected
from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. If
Medpedia is involved in a change of control Medpedia will provide notice before personal
information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event of Medpedia's bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally,
Medpedia may not be able to control how your personal information is treated,
transferred, or used.</p>

<p>Except as described above, Medpedia will not share your personal information with
third parties unless you have elected to "opt-in" to such
sharing of your information.</p>

<p>Please <a href="http://www.medpedia.com/index.php/Special:Contact">contact
Medpedia</a> for any additional questions about the management or use of personal
data.</p>

<h3>Your Choices</h3>

<p>When you register as an Editor and Member, Medpedia asks you for personal information.
If Medpedia wants to use your personal information for purposes other than those
described in this Policy, Medpedia will provide you with an effective way to opt-in to
such use.</p>

<p>Medpedia will not collect or use personal information for reasons other than those
described in this Privacy Policy, unless Medpedia obtains your prior consent.</p>

<p>You can decline to submit personal information to Medpedia, in which case you will not
be able to participate as an Editor.</p>

personal information. Medpedia cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
personal information and you provide such information at your own risk.</p>
