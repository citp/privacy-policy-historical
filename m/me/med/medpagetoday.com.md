**MedPage Today Privacy Policy**

This Policy was last changed on July 24, 2014. 

MedPage Today, LLC operates this website (the "Site"), and the services related to or offered on the Site (the "Services"). These Services may include, without limitation, tools, applications, email services, bulletin and message boards, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, calendars and downloadable mobile applications related to the Site or provided through the Site. MedPageToday.com also contains advertisements, promotions and sponsored areas that are sold directly by Everyday Health Media, LLC ("EHM"), a sister company of MedPage Today, LLC. 

We provide you this privacy policy (the "Policy") to help you understand the kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit the Site or use any of our Services, how we may use and disclose the information, and how you can control, correct and/or update the information. 

To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Policy, we mean information that can be used to identify or contact a person, like a person's full name, address, email address or phone number. When we use the phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Policy, we mean information that cannot reasonably be used to identify individual persons. 

By visiting this Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy. Each time you visit the Site or use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy. 

Your Personal Information will be processed by us in the United States. 

  1. **The Information We Gather**

We receive information about you in the following ways:

    1.  **Information You Voluntarily Provide Us**

We collect and maintain information that you voluntarily submit to us during your use of the Site and Services. For example:

      * when you register for a Site or participate in CME activities, you may provide us certain information including your name, email address, password, demographic information, State of Licensure or AMA ME Number and practice area; 
      * to engage a Site's social networking function, you may add to your profile by providing information about your interests; 
      * if you sign-up to receive a newsletter, or participate in social networking activities, you may provide us contact information (e.g., email or physical address); and 
      * when you participate in sponsored or unsponsored market research surveys you may be asked to provide personal information in addition to providing your responses to the survey questions; and 
      * you may provide us with Personal Information in the course of email, or customer support interactions.   
You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may stop you from gaining access to a Service or limit the features that you can use. For more information, please see the How We Use Your Information section below. 
    2. **Information We Collect Through Your Use of the Site.**

As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through cookies, pixels, web beacons, log files and other technologies, information may be collected about how you use the Site and the Services. For example your IP address may indicate that your computer or device is located in New York City and this information may be used to deliver advertisements promoting New York City based-businesses. The information allows for the delivery of more helpful information, programs, tools and advertisements. Please see the Cookies and Targeted Advertising sections below for more information. 

    3. **Information Received From Third Parties.**

Online and/or offline information received from third parties may be combined with the information already collected from you via the Site and Services. The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including to verify other information about you (e.g., verify your mailing address to send you requested products or services) and to enhance the content and advertising provided to you. Information from third parties may also be used to verify and update registration information and confirm licensure status. 

  2. **Use of Your Information**

Your Personal Information will be used in the ways described below or as described at the time that the information is collected. 

    1. **Advertising.**

Advertisements that you see are customized based upon: (i) the information that you provide (e.g., age, gender, stated area of practice and other information in your profile); (ii) geographic location information which may be determined through your IP address, from your mobile device or other ways; (iii) data received from third parties or (iv) your visits on the Site or use of the Services (commonly referred to as "Behavioral Advertising"). Please see the Cookies and Targeted Advertising section below for more information on the use of cookies and the information collected for Behavioral Advertising. 

You can limit the way advertising is tailored to you by deleting the cookies that we have placed on your browser. Please see the section below on Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Address Information for more information. 

    2. **To Provide the Site and Services.**

Your Personal Information is used as necessary or appropriate to provide you the Site and Services, including to: 

      * administer your account;
      * provide CME and ensure you receive proper CME credit from our accredited CME provider;
      * register you and provide you access to the Site or Services;

  3. **Cookies and Targeted Advertising**
    1.  **Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Address Information.**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website places on your browser when you visit that website. Cookies may be used to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Site and Services. For example, cookies may be used to control what advertisements you see, the sequence of advertisements and to make sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times. For polls, cookies may be used to help ensure that an individual can't vote more than once on a particular question or issue. We do not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer. 

Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser's directions within the help tab. In order to use certain Services offered through the Site, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Site may not work properly, and you may not be able to access our Services. 

Cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) may be used to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened or on which advertisements you clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Site and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. 

An "Internet Protocol Address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We, or our service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Site or Services or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted content and advertisements. 

    2. **Targeted Advertising**

EHM and other companies that we work with may use cookies for purposes including understanding web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Site, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests. For example, if you read an article about a particular health condition on the Site, cookies from a vendor may be used to later serve you an advertisement for a product related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on our Site with information about pages you visit on other websites and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Site or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with our vendor.

You can choose to limit Behavioral Advertising on the Sites by clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and opting-out of cookies placed by those vendors listed. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out. The Site currently is not setup to process or respond to “Do Not Track” settings or signals from web browsers.

We do adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (for more information click [here](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers)).

    3.  **Information Collected by Third Party Advertisers**

Advertisers or other third parties on the Site may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. We do not control these advertisers or other parties' use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the [ website and ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)[DAA Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.
