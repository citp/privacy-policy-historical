            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") set forth MediaTab Way Ltd ("MediaTab", "we", "our" or "us"), use of information we collect, receive and store via our Licensed Properties (as defined in our Terms of End User License Agreement).</strong></p>
            <p><b>1.</b>
              <ins><b>Introduction</b></ins>. We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information (as defined below), is collected and used in connection with the Licensed Properties. "Personal Information" means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.</p>
            <p><b>2.</b>
              <ins><b>Terms of Use and EULA</b></ins>. This Privacy Policy forms part of the End User License Agreement which can be viewed from within the Licensed Properties (“EULA”). Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to in the EULA.</p>
            <p><b>3.</b>
              <ins><b>Consent and Modification</b></ins>. By using the Licensed Properties, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Licensed Properties. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective only following posting of the revised Privacy Policy, and your continued use of the Licensed Properties thereafter means that you accept those changes.</p>
            <p><b>4.</b> <b>What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It</b>. We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in one or more of the following ways:</p>
            <p class="mini_p"><b>4.1.</b> 'Contact Us' Information If you send us a "Contact Us" request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available or by sending an email to an email address that we display, you may be required to provide us with certain information such as your name and email address.</p>
            <p class="mini_p"><b>4.2.</b> Location Data. We may provide certain location-based services ("Location Services") in connection with the Licensed Properties that are dependent on data related to the geographic location of your PC or mobile device on which the Licensed Properties is installed ("Location Data"). If you choose to participate in these Location Services, you agree that we may collect or obtain your Location Data. You should be able to use the settings on your mobile device to turn off location-sharing features.</p>
            <p class="mini_p"><b>4.3.</b>
              <ins><b>Profile</b></ins>. Some parts of the Licensed Properties may enable you to build a public profile in connection with your Account ("<b>Public Profile</b>"). Your Public Profile will include among other things and without limitation your name, your mobile device information and identification, and other information that you choose to include in your Public Profile, such as your contact information.</p>
            <p class="mini_p"><b>4.4.</b>
              <ins><b>Log Files</b></ins>. We may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer our services, track user's movement around the services, and gather demographic information.</p>
            <p class="mini_p"><b>4.5.</b>
              <ins><b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b></ins>. The Licensed Properties may utilize "cookies", anonymous identifiers and other tracking technologies in order to for us to provide our Licensed Properties and present you with information that is customized for you. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about activity on the Licensed Properties. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.</p>
            <p class="mini_p"><b>4.6.</b>
              <ins><b>Mobile Device Data</b></ins>. We may collect limited information from your mobile device in order to provide the Licensed Properties. Such information may include your mobile device type, mobile device ID, and date and time stamps of App use. In addition, we may deploy tracking technologies within the Licensed Properties to help us gather aggregate statistics, but we will not use Personal Information for such purposes.</p>

The notices and tools that we provide on the Licensed Properties should help inform you which information will be made publicly available. If you publish your contact information in any User Submissions or as part of your Public Profile, you may receive unsolicited messages from other users of the Licensed Properties or the public. We therefore encourage you to only post information that you are sure you want to be accessible to anyone.</p>

                <ins><b>Opting Out</b></ins>. You may choose not to receive future promotional, advertising, or other services-related emails from us by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that we send.

              <p><b>9.</b>
                <ins><b>Choice</b></ins>. At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information.
