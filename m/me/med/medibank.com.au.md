This Privacy Policy explains how we manage the personal information that we collect, use and disclose and how to contact us if you have any questions about the management of your personal information or would like to access the personal information we hold about you.

**Requirements of the privacy legislation**

We are required to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ( **Privacy Act** ) which regulates how personal information is handled from collection to use and disclosure, storage, access and disposal.

Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion. It includes your name, age, gender, contact details as well as your health information (which is also sensitive information).

We may also collect your personal (including sensitive) information from our subsidiaries or a third party (for example, a hospital or other health service provider, employer, educational institution, government agency or adviser that has dealt with you).

**How will we use your personal information?**

We will use your personal (including sensitive) information for the purposes for which we collect it as described above, including to:

  * administer, process and audit claims;
  * manage, review, develop and improve our insurance products and related services (including health services) whether provided by us or other parties on our behalf;

We will handle all personal (including sensitive information) we collect from third parties about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Our range of products and services and our functions and activities, as well as those of our contracted service providers, may change from time to time.

If you do not provide personal information requested of you to Medibank, we may be unable to provide you with insurance cover, pay you benefits or provide you with or facilitate the provision of other services.

In addition to the collections, uses and disclosures described above, our subsidiaries may also disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to us and each other in order for us and them to assess from what other services you may benefit and to facilitate the provision of such services. We may also disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to our subsidiaries so the Medibank Group may have an integrated view of our members and provide you a better and personalised service. Our subsidiaries may use your personal (including sensitive) information to contact you (including by telephone call, text message or email) in relation to their services.
