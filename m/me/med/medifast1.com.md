The Company Websites contain links to other sites. Once you enter another website, be aware that Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit through links on the Company Websites. We hope that reading Our Privacy Policy gives you a clear idea of how We manage information about you.

While you may use some of the functionality of the Company Websites without registering for an account, many of the specific tools and services on the Company Websites require registration. If you choose to register with the Company Websites for certain services, We require you to submit Personal Data. Depending on the tool or service you have selected, we may also collect Personal Health Information such as your weight, health conditions, and medications, among other information. “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, address or phone number or an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Data you submit to the Company Websites. Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using the Company Websites and tools and Our ability to contact you as contemplated in this Privacy Policy.
