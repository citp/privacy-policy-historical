**I. PRIVACY POLICY**

**II. TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT**  
  
---  
  
**I. PRIVACY POLICY**  
mediabistro is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. We do not share our users' personal information unless you specifically authorize us to, or unless required by law. We do not derive any profit from selling or sharing email addresses or personally-identifiable information to any other party. The following discloses in more detail the information gathering and dissemination practices for the mediabistro.com Web site and all its site-related services (collectively, the "Site") provided by mediabistro inc ("Mediabistro", "Mediabistro.com", "we", "us") to you ("users", "visitors", "members"). By using the Site, you express your agreement with these terms. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Site. If you have questions or concerns or suggestions regarding this statement, please contact wecare@mediabistro.com. 

1) Information Collected  
2) Communications from mediabistro.com   
3) Sharing of Information   
4) Choice / Opt-out   
5) Notification of Changes to this Privacy Policy   
6) Links, and Security   
7) How to contact us 

1) INFORMATION COLLECTED   
We collect information from our users at several different points and in several ways on our Web site.  
a) **Registration and Manage Account page**   
In order to use portions of this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user gives contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest.   
b) **Profile**  
c) **Job Alerts**  
d) **Post Resume**   
e) **Order Forms**   
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used only for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.   
f) **Surveys  
** From time-to-time we may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.   
g) **Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies are temporary files, deleted when the user closes his browser, that are used to ease the user's navigation of the site, for instance by remembering what pages have been viewed or what parts of a form have been completed. Persistent cookies are small files stored on the user's hard drive for extended periods of time, which are used by mediabistro.com to identify returning users to the site, and to speed up the login process for these users. Persistent cookies can be deleted by following the instructions in your Internet browser software. Third-party advertisers may place and/or recognize cookies on our site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising  
h) Third Party Advertising Some ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Doubleclick, our Web advertising partner. Information about users’ visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by mediabistro.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  
i) **Log Files**  
Like most standard Web sites we use log files. These files record site visitors' internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. They are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
j) **Clear Gifs** (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)   
We employ [or our third party advertising company employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable information. 

2) COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE   
a) **Special Offers and Updates**  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.   
b) **Newsletter** If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.   
c) **Service Announcements** On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.  
d) **Customer Service** We communicate with users on a regular basis, including by email, to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to users' accounts.

3) SHARING OF INFORMATION  
mediabistro.com will not share any user's information with any other party, except for in the following limited instances:   
a) **Disclosure** specifically authorized by the User For instance, if you opt to have your Email Address linked to your postings on the Bulletin Board, it will then be viewable by other visitors to the Bulletin Board section of the Site. Or, if you place a Resume on the Site, and then distribute the unique URL for that Resume to others, the resume will then be viewable on the Site to any web browser which goes to that URL.  
b) **Legal Compliance**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.   
c) **Aggregate Information** (non-personally identifiable)   
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.   
d) **Third Party Advertisers** (non-personally identifiable)  
mediabistro inc. shares Web site usage information about users with Doubleclick for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site and other sites. For example, mediabistro inc. uses cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The information they collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click [here](http://www.sonar.com/NAIPRIVACY).   
e) **Third Party Payments**   
We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  
f) **Other Service Providers**   
We currently partner with third-party service providers, (such as eRSVP.com, which provides us with event-management services). When the user employs or participates in these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.   
g) **Business Transitions**  
In the event mediabistro inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or bankruptcy, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section. 

4) CHOICE / OPT-OUT   
a) **Choice/Opt-out**  
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and other communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing us at wecare@mediabistro.com or by going to the Manage Account page in the Members Center (http://www.mediabistro.com/memberscenter).  
b) **Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**   
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way for the user to correct, update or delete this information. This can be done at the Members' Center (http://www.mediabistro.com/memberscenter) or by emailing us at wecare@mediabistro.com.   
c) **Resumes**  
Any resume a user creates on or uploads to the Site will be kept there until deleted by the user. Once deleted, a resume will not be used by mediabistro.com for any purpose, or in any way made available to other parties.

5) NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY   
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.

6) LINKS, SECURITY   
a) **Links**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, mediabistro inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.   
b) **Security**   
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.
