#### 6\. What Rights do You Have in Relation to Personal Information We Hold About You?

Under the Privacy Act, you have a right to seek access to information we hold about you (although there are some exceptions to this). You also have the right to ask us to correct information about you which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. 

If you wish to exercise your rights under the Privacy Act to seek access to, or to correct, the personal information we hold about you, please contact AAP's Privacy Officer by e-mail at [privacy@aap.com.au](mailto:privacy@aap.com.au), or by mail to PO Box 3411, Rhodes Waterside, Rhodes NSW 2138. When contacting AAP's Privacy Officer, please provide as much detail as possible to assist us to follow up your request. 

In the first instance, we will generally provide you with a summary of the information we hold about you. We will assume (unless you tell us otherwise) that your request relates to our current records about you. These current records will include personal information about you which is included in our computers, databases and in paper files, and which may be used by us on a day to day basis.

To provide you with access to this personal information, we will ordinarily provide you with a print-out of the relevant personal information from our databases, or with photocopies of records which are held only on paper files. If personal information about you (for example, your name & address details) is duplicated across different databases, we will generally provide you with one print-out of this information, rather than multiple print-outs. Ordinarily, we will not charge you for the cost of providing this type of access to these records. 

For legal and administrative reasons, we may also store records containing personal information in our archives. You may seek access to the records held by us which are not current records, but if you do so, we may charge you for the cost of providing access. 

Also please be aware that if the relevant personal information was collected before 21 December 2001, we will only provide you with access in accordance with section 16C of the Privacy Act 1988. This states that we only need to give you access to personal information collected before 21 December 2001 if we use and disclose that information after that date, and if providing access would not create an unreasonable administrative burden or unreasonable expense. 

If you are of the view that personal information about you is not accurate, complete or up to date, please provide AAP's Privacy Officer with your request for correction. Our policy is to consider any requests for correction in a timely manner.
