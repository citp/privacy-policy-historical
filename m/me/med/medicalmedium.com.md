**a. What are cookies?**

To make our Website work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

**b. What are cookies used for?**

Cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”), allow a website or service to determine if it was previously visited by your computer or mobile device. Cookies are used to identify users and remember their actions, and for online behavioral advertising.
