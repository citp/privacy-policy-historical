**Registration:**

Visitors may be asked to provide certain personal information when they purchase our products including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access our web sites. The personal information collected during the registration process is used to manage each Visitor’s account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.

**MMI Partners and Sponsors:**

Some products and services may be offered to Visitors in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature.

**Responses to Email Inquiries:**

When Visitors send email inquiries to MMI, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. MMI does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.

**Voluntary Customer Surveys:**

We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.

We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.

It is our policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or information regarding your use of our web sites, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies; collection agencies; merchant database agencies; law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to operate our services properly; or to protect MMI..

MMI has no control over the third parties’ use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.
