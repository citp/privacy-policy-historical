# The WebMD Health Professional Network Privacy Policy

#### Web Sites Covered

WebMD and Medscape understand how important the privacy of personal information is to you and are committed to honoring your privacy. The document you are reading is the Privacy Policy for the professional Web sites owned and operated by WebMD and the professional Web sites owned and operated by Medscape. This Privacy Policy describes what information may be collected about you when you use one of these Web sites, how this information may be used, how you can control how your information is used, and what precautions are taken against unauthorized access or use of your information. You should read the privacy policy at each Web site that you visit after you leave any of the WebMD or Medscape Professional Sites. Neither WebMD nor Medscape is responsible for how other Web sites treat your privacy once you leave one of our Professional Sites.

Reference to "WebMD" means WebMD LLC, including any company that WebMD controls (for example a subsidiary that it owns). For purposes of this Policy, WebMD's Web sites include [www.medscape.com](http://www.medscape.com/), and [www.emedicine.com](http://www.emedicine.com/) (referred to as the "WebMD Professional Sites"). Reference to "Medscape" means Medscape, LLC, including any company that Medscape controls (for example a subsidiary that it owns), and Medscape's Web sites include [www.medscapecme.com](http://www.medscapecme.com/), and [www.theheart.org](http://www.theheart.org/) (referred to as the "Medscape Professional Sites" and referred to together with the WebMD Professional Sites as the "Professional Sites"). Reference to "we" or "our" means WebMD and Medscape. We may share information among the subsidiaries of WebMD Health Corp. (the parent company of both WebMD and Medscape) and the respective Professional Sites that we each own or control, but it is always protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

You can visit our [corporate site](http://www.wbmd.com/) at www.wbmd.com to learn more about WebMD and Medscape, obtain investor information, and obtain contact information.

#### Privacy Policy Changes

As this Privacy Policy changes in significant ways, we will make every effort to notify you of the changes. Minor changes to this Privacy Policy may occur that will not affect the ways in which we each use your individually identifiable information. In these instances, we may not notify you of such minor changes. When this Privacy Policy changes in a way that significantly affects the way we handle personal information, we will not apply the new Policy to information we have previously gathered without obtaining consent from the appropriate individual. We will post Privacy Policy changes on our respective Professional Sites in a timely manner.

### Information We Collect

In this section of our Privacy Policy, we discuss the different types of information that WebMD and Medscape may collect about you, and the ways in such information may be collected.

#### Information We Collect from Unregistered Visitors

You must register to access all services provided by the Professional Sites, however, visitors to each of our Professional Sites can access the home page and browse some areas of the Site without disclosing any personally identifiable information. However, we do track information provided to us by your browser when you visit one of these Sites, even if you have not registered, including the third party site you came from (known as the "referring URL"), the type of browser you use, the time and date of access to the Site, and other information that does not personally identify you.

#### Information We Collect When You Register

When you register for the services provided by the Professional Sites, you are asked to provide identifying information such as your name, gender, contact information, and other personal information. On the registration screen, information that is required for registration is clearly labeled as such, as is information that is optional and may be given at your discretion. You will also be given a choice about whether or not you want to receive newsletters and other information sent to registered members from time to time. If any of the Professional Sites request additional personally identifiable information from you, and the owner of that Site wishes to use such personally identifiable information (or personally identifiable information that you have previously provided) in a manner not otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, the Site will clearly explain how such personally identifiable information will be used and request your consent to any such collection and use.

#### Information from Outside Sources

We may also collect additional information about a registered user from other sources in order to verify licensure status and identity. In some cases, we may ask a registered user for additional information, when necessary to process an order for purchase (e.g., credit card number). Additionally, we may contact financial or credit organizations to confirm customer credit cards.

#### Other Information

  * **Discussion Boards:** When you post a message to a discussion board on one of the Professional Sites, your alias will be available for all registered users to see. An alias consists of your username, specialty and geographic information and other information you agree to show in a profile to others. You should not post any information to one of our discussion boards or other public forums if you want to keep such information private or you are required by law to keep such information private. Information you post to discussion boards is considered public information. 
  * **Tools:** Clinical tools may be available on some of the Professional Sites. These tools may require you to provide information for the tools to operate (for example, a clinical calculator that provides information on adjusting drug dosage). These tools may store information that you provide on our servers. We will always make it clear to you when information that you provide through a tool will be saved.
  * **Member Lookup:** When you register for the Professional Sites, you may have a choice about whether or not you want other members to be able to look you up and send you messages. If you opt not to be listed, no other members will be able to look you up. 
  * **Additional Forms and Emails:** We may also ask you to provide additional information after you register if you want to obtain additional services or information or to resolve complaints or concerns.



In addition, when you use the Professional Sites, certain information about you is automatically collected by our Web server, such as your IP address and domain name. We may use this information to personalize our offerings and presentations to you, facilitate your movements throughout the Professional Sites, provide personalized services, and to communicate with you individually.

#### Continuing Medical Education 

When you register for a Continuing Medical Education (CME) or a Continuing Education (CE) activity through one of Medscape's Professional Sites, Medscape will collect certain personally identifiable information from you such as your name, email address and mailing address. If you are a nurse or a pharmacist and wish to receive CE credit, you are also required to provide the state in which you are licensed and your license number. In addition to personally identifiable information, Medscape also collects aggregated non-personally identifiable information about the activities undertaken by users of the Medscape Professional Sites. Medscape will use the information that it collects in connection with its CME/CE activities in several ways:

  * Medscape is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians. As an ACCME accredited entity, Medscape is required periodically to submit aggregated data about CME participants and the CME activities that it certifies. Medscape also provides personally identifiable information to other accredited CME/CE providers who certify CME/CE activities posted on its Web sites, as necessary for their fulfillment of their reporting obligations to the ACCME and other accrediting bodies. These reports may include personally identifiable information about you and credits issued to you, for the purpose of maintaining records that you can request from the accredited provider for up to six (6) years; 
  * Supporters of CME/CE activities on Medscape's Professional Sites will receive only aggregated data about CME/CE activities that are relevant to their interests and/or the courses they support; and
  * Medscape's Editorial and Customer Support Staff will have internal access to files containing personally identifiable information, including evaluation forms and aggregated CME /CE participant information. These files can be accessed in order to respond to your questions or comments. Medscape's staff may also use personally identifiable information, including registration information and evaluation data, in assessing educational needs and evaluating activities.



#### Use of Cookies and Web Beacons

Cookies are a technology that WebMD and Medscape use to keep track of users as they move through each of the Professional Sites. Your browser allows us to place some information on your computer's hard drive that is associated with the computer you are using. WebMD and Medscape use cookies to personalize the Professional Sites and to track your usage across these Sites.

Your Web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, Web sites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the Web site, and some Web site functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies.

Although cookies do not normally contain personally identifiable information, if you are a registered user of the Professional Sites, we may elect to associate your registration information with cookies that each of the Professional Sites place on your computer's hard drive. Associating a cookie with your registration data allows us to offer increased personalization and functionality. For example, you can elect to have the Professional Sites "remember" your user name and password and bypass the sign-in process on each visit to one of these Sites. Without cookies, this functionality would not be possible.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). We have told them that we do not want them to use cookie information to track our users' activities once they leave our Web sites. However, because of the way advertisements are served on our Web sites, we do not have total control over how advertisers use cookies on our Web site. If you believe that one of our advertisers is placing an unwanted cookie on your hard drive, please contact the [privacy officer](mailto:MedscapePrivacy@webmd.net) to assist us in resolving the problem.

We also may use Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Professional Sites and the sites of selected Professional Site sponsors and advertisers, as well as your use of special promotions or newsletters. Web beacons are tiny graphic image files, embedded in a Web page in GIF, JPG, or HTML format, that provide a presence on the Web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser, or some other third party) information from a user's browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type of browser that is accessing the site, and the ID number of any cookies on the user's computer that were previously placed by that server. Web beacons can also be used to place a cookie on the user's browser. The information collected by web beacons allows the statistical monitoring of (i) how many people are using the Professional Sites, (ii) how many people open Medscape and WebMD emails, and (iii) for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our Web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of the Professional Sites or those of the sponsors of the Sites. We do not link non-personally identifiable information from web beacons to personally identifiable information without your permission; we do not use web beacons to collect or store personal health information about you.

Third parties under contract with WebMD may use cookies or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your usage of WebMD's Professional Sites. These third parties may use this information, on our behalf, to help target our advertising you may see on their sites within their networks. and WebMD may further tailor the advertising on these third party sites based on your geographic location (zip code), gender and/or age range to the extent known by these third parties. These third parties have agreed not to use this non-personal information they collect from our sites except to deliver advertisements on our behalf. If your browser is set to reject cookies, this non-personally identifiable information will not be sent to these third parties.

Sponsors or advertisers on the WebMD Professional Sites may use their own cookies, web beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the WebMD Professional Sites and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their ads on the WebMD Professional Sites and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or Web beacons on the WebMD Professional Sites. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the Web site of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected destination (e.g., back to the WebMD Professional Site to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.

WebMD does not control these third parties' use of cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them. However, WebMD does require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie or web beacon information through the WebMD Professional web site to agree that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from the WebMD Professional Site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any non-personal cookie or web beacon information collected by them on the WebMD Professional Site to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program. In addition, WebMD's Advertising Policy is posted on WebMD's Professional Sites and will provide additional detail about our relationship with advertisers and the companies that serve ads. You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our Sites to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or web beacons on their own sites. Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must Opt-out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can Opt-out of Cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) gateway Opt-out site. This Web site will also allow you to review the Ad Server's privacy policies.

#### Children's Privacy

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Professional Sites are designed and intended for use by adults, and are not intended for, nor designed to be used by children under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we know is a child under the age of 18.

### Uses We Make of Information

In this section of our Privacy Policy, we identify the ways we may use information about you that we have collected.

#### Aggregate Data

WebMD and Medscape create aggregate data about visitors to the WebMD Professional Sites and Medscape Professional Sites, respectively, for product development and improvement activities. We also use it for market analysis. We may provide information from each of our Professional Sites in aggregate form, with identifying information removed, to third parties. For example, we may tell a health care partner what percentage of our registered users reside in a particular geographical area. When aggregated health information is provided, we pool it from many individual records and strip it of any data that could be used to identify an individual before it is used. Any third party that receives aggregated health care data must agree not to attempt to re-identify the people it belongs to. For example, WebMD may provide a potential advertiser of a diabetes-related product information on the WebMD Professional Sites about the number of registered members of the WebMD Professional Sites that have identified themselves as endocrinologists. Depending on our agreement with the third parties, we may or may not charge for this information.

#### Marketing and Advertising

WebMD may target its advertising or marketing on the WebMD Professional Sites depending on information it has about you. For example, a user that WebMD knows is a woman may receive advertising for products targeted at women that a male user will not see, or a user that WebMD knows is a healthcare professional who treats diabetes may receive advertising for new diabetes therapies (although in neither case will the advertiser have access to any individually identifiable information about you).

WebMD and Medscape may also personalize the Professional Sites that we each control based on your interests. For example, you may see different articles in different places on www.medscape.com based on information you have shared with WebMD, or information that WebMD has obtained by observing your previous behavior, or information that WebMD may have gained from your interactions with a third party that shares such information with WebMD. We use this type of information for our own internal marketing, research, and related purposes.

#### Third Parties

In addition to aggregate information (discussed previously), WebMD and Medscape may each share some kinds of personally identifiable information with third parties as described below.

  * **Other Companies:** We have strategic relationships with other companies who offer products and services on the Professional Sites. When you are interacting with those companies, different rules and privacy policies may apply. For example, if you order a book from a bookstore that advertises on a WebMD Professional Site, you will be asked to provide identifying information and credit card information to the company that runs the bookstore. We do not control the collection or use of information you provide under those circumstances, but we do require that those companies clearly state their policies so you can decide whether to give them any information.
  * **Companies and People Who Work for Us:** WebMD and Medscape each contract with other companies and individuals to help us provide our respective services. For example, we may host some of our Professional Sites on another company's computers, hire technical consultants to maintain any Web-based health tools, or work with companies to remove repetitive information from customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, and provide customer service. In addition, if you are a healthcare professional, we may validate your licensure status and other information against available databases that list licensed health care professionals. In order to perform their jobs, these other companies may have limited access to some of the personal information we maintain about users of the Professional Sites. We require all such companies to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to limit their access to any personal information to the minimum necessary to perform their obligations, and not to use the information they may access for purposes other than fulfilling their responsibilities to us. We use our best efforts to limit the use of other companies in areas where personally identifiable healthcare information may be involved.
  * **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes WebMD sends offers to selected groups of users on behalf of other businesses. When WebMD does this, it does not give that business your name and address. WebMD provides a variety of mechanisms for you to tell it that you do not want to receive such promotional offers.
  * **Business Transfers:** If WebMD or Medscape transfers a business unit (such as a subsidiary) or an asset (such as a Web site) to another company, that company will be required to honor the applicable terms of this Privacy Policy.
  * **Legal Requirements:** We may release account and other personal information when we believe release is required to comply with law. We may release personal health information, including information from a medical record, if, in our judgment after review by an attorney, the release is compelled by law or regulation, or if the release is necessary to prevent the death or serious injury of an individual.
  * **Consent:** We may release personally identifiable information to a third party in accordance with your consent, subject to the purposes and limits that we disclose when we request your consent.



When we share information with third parties, we ask that they agree in writing to abide by this Privacy Policy.

If we discover that a third party inadvertently disclosed personal information about any of our users, we will take immediate action to prevent further occurrences.

### Protection of Information

In this section of our Privacy Policy, we discuss the security measures we take to protect information that we have collected about you.

#### General Policies

We have implemented technology and security policies, rules and other measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from unauthorized access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction, and accidental loss. We also protect your information by requiring that all our employees and others who have access to or are associated with the processing of your data respect your confidentiality.

We use security methods to determine the identity of registered users, so that appropriate rights and restrictions can be enforced for that user. Reliable verification of user identity is called authentication. We use both passwords and usernames to authenticate users. Users are responsible for maintaining their own passwords.

#### Storage of Health Information

Personally identifiable health information you share with us is stored on our database servers at our data centers or hosted by third parties who have entered into agreements with us that require them to comply with this Privacy Policy. We have a firewall to prevent unauthorized access. Data centers are physically secure and protected from unauthorized access by unauthorized persons. Physical access to the servers requires individual authorization and authentication.

Information in our data centers is backed up routinely, in order to aid in the recovery of information in the event of accidental damage of information or due to a natural disaster. The backup media are stored in a physically secure storage facility.

### Access to Information and Choices

In this section of this Privacy Policy, we tell you how to obtain and correct information we have about you, and how to choose what types of information you may share with us.

#### Correction of Information We Have About You

If you believe that there are errors in the registration information associated with your account, you may edit your personal profile any time that you like. You can directly edit your user profile on the Professional Site on which you initially registered. Requests for deletion of your record may result in your removal from the registry, but we may keep certain demographic information about you for product improvement purposes. You may contact Customer Support and ask for the changes that you would like to make.

#### Employees

Employees are required to keep your information private, as a condition of their employment with us. Only selected, authorized employees are permitted to access health information.

Employees with access to personally identifiable health information are required to attend a confidentiality/privacy training class, and to sign a confidentiality agreement. All employees and contractors must abide by our Privacy Policy, and those who violate that policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of their employment and legal action.
