**_MedHunters' Privacy Policy_**

**Protecting Your Privacy is Important to Us**

> MedHunters is committed to providing you with a safe, secure environment from which you can confidently register and receive our job matching services. To demonstrate our firm commitment to assuring your privacy, MedHunters has created this privacy statement to explain the information gathering and dissemination practices we use on our website. Our promise to you is that we will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and will only be used for the purposes described herein.

**Domain names and/or IP addresses are logged _ONLY_ for system administration purposes.**

> We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Be assured that we do not link IP addresses to anything that can personally identify you. 
> 
> On our site, in certain areas, such as Jobseeker registration, or Employer account areas, we ask for information that offers you the option of providing us with your name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, demographic, preference and other personal information, and various other kinds of details. We gather this personal information with your knowledge, and active permission and participation. This personal information is not shared with a third party except for the purpose of processing your order or matching you with job opportunities, and then, only with your written or expressed consent. 
> 
> In addition, our site does not use cookies. We do not track any information based on your visits, other than the information you provide on your own. 

**Specific Information We Collect About Our Visitors**

> **Our Job Seekers**
> 
> In order for MedHunters help you find the job you want - where you want it - we ask that you complete our online, password-protected registration/resume builder profile. This allows you to provide us with all of your personal and professional information so that we can offer you job opportunities that best meet your interests and abilities. When you register, we realize that we ask for very confidential information from you, and we want you to know that we treat this with the highest degree of privacy possible. No information is released to anyone without your permission - permission is granted when you verbally agree to have your information sent to an employer (i.e. when you are talking to one of our staff) or when you apply for a job online on our site or through e-mail.
