* * *

## Overview

MedHunters.com Inc. ("MedHunters") is committed to providing you with a safe, secure environment from which you can confidently register, apply for jobs and receive our job matching services. To demonstrate our firm commitment to assuring your privacy, MedHunters has created this privacy statement to explain the information gathering, storage and dissemination practices we use on our Site. Our promise to you is that we will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and will only be used for the purposes described herein.

By accessing, using and/or registering on this Site, you consent to the policies and practices described in this statement.

Note that this Site is also governed by the [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/termsOfUse.html). Please review these policies before using this Site.

## Collection of Information

### Anonymous browsing

You can use our Site without revealing any information about yourself. In this case, we gather or may gather certain information about your use of our Site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Our web server may collect the following information about your computer hardware and software: IP address, domain name, browser type and version, operating system type and version, the referring web site, the web site you visit next, and access times. 

This information is used to evaluate different aspects of the MedHunters Site, including monitoring Site performance for systems administration purposes, improving the functionality of the Site, and reporting aggregate information to our clients and prospective customers (e.g. how much traffic we get to the Site). Statistics about traffic patterns and Site usage are reported on an aggregate basis only and do not include any personal information that identifies individuals.

### Collection, Retention, Disclosure and Use of Information

When you register on MedHunters, we require the following information from you: name, address, telephone number, email address, work history, educational history, location preferences, desired work status, licensure, and employment eligibility. You will also be asked to provide a copy of your résumé for our database. This information is used to create an online, searchable profile that can be accessed by the employers who advertise on our Site or who have database access to our Site.

We use this information to: 1) provide advertisers with aggregate information about our job seeker database, 2) provide Site developers with information that will enable them to develop appropriate content, features and services, and 3) inform you of job opportunities that may interest you. You have two options with respect to privacy when you register on MedHunters:

  1. You can store your résumé in our database but indicate that you would like all of your contact information kept confidential. This means that employers will not be able to see any information by which you could be identified, including your contact information, names of current and past employers and educational institution(s) attended. Employers will only be able to see a profile that contains the job title(s) you have held, years of work experience, the degrees you hold (but not educational institution). Employers will also be able to see your dates of registration and last contact with MedHunters as well as your location of preference. You can use your confidential online résumé to apply for jobs, in which case such application constitutes a release of all your personal information. 
  2. You can store your résumé in our database and allow it to be searchable by employers. In this case, employers will have access to all of the information you provided to register on MedHunters, including but not limited to your contact information, work history and educational history. 



You can change your privacy preferences at any time by logging into your MedHunters account or by contacting our Job Seeker Services team at 800-664-0278 or [jobseekers@medhunters.com](mailto:jobseekers@medhunters.com). 

Should you choose to keep all of your information confidential, employers can send you emails through your MyMedHunters account. Your information will only be released when you either send us an email indicating that you would like your information released to a specific employer, or apply directly online to an employer. Online application constitutes a release of your personal information.

Access to our résumé database is restricted only to subscribing employers, law enforcement and national security agencies. MedHunters cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. You may remove your résumé from our database at any time or change your privacy preferences. However, employers who currently have access to that database or who have had access to the database in the past, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your résumé in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of résumés in these instances.

We may also use, disclose and communicate your personal information if required to do so by the law including by an order of the court.

Your job application history is retained on our system. You are able to see your job application history for six months, to enable you to see which jobs you have recently applied for. Only you personally and MedHunters employees are able to see your job application history. Should you choose to remove your résumé from our database or close your MyMedHunters account, we will remove your résumé, and MyMedHunters profile information from our externally visible system. Please note that a copy of any information that you have provided may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case even though no information about your account remains in our active user databases and is not visible to yourself or to subscribing employers.

Some job postings on the MedHunters Site link directly to the employer�s web site and require you to enter your information into their system in order to apply. In such cases, you will be providing your résumé directly to the employer and your résumé will be subject to their privacy policy. MedHunters is not responsible for the privacy practices of such employer. 

We may also use your contact information to send you emails about updates to the MedHunters Site or new features or services offered by MedHunters or our business partners or to contact you about your opinion of current products and services or potential future products and services. At the time of registering, you have the option to decline to receive such information from MedHunters. 

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to MedHunters, such as service announcements, administrative messages, information about specific job opportunities, and the MedHunters weekly newsletter that are considered part of your MedHunters account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of them.

Should you choose to submit feedback to MedHunters, such feedback becomes our property and we can use such feedback (such as job seeker testimonials) for marketing purposes or to contact you for further information.
