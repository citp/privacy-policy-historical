<h2>The WebMD Health Professional Network Privacy Policy</h2>

<h4>Services Web Sites Covered</h4>
<p>WebMD and Medscape provide users with access to a wide variety of resources through their respective professional Web sites including, but not limited to, articles, reference tools, sponsored programs, continuing medical education, communication tools, message boards and search services (collectively, the "Services"). WebMD and Medscape understand how important the privacy of personal information is to you and are committed to honoring your privacy. The document you are reading is the Privacy Policy for the Services provided through the professional Web sites owned and operated by WebMD and Medscape. This Privacy Policy describes what information may be collected about you when you use the Services, how this information may be used, how you can control how your information is used, and what precautions are taken against unauthorized access or use of your information. You should read the privacy policy at each Web site that you visit after you leave any of the WebMD or Medscape professional Web sites. Neither WebMD nor Medscape is responsible for how other Web sites treat your privacy once you leave one of our Web sites.</p>

<p>Reference to "WebMD" means WebMD LLC, including any company that WebMD controls (for example a subsidiary that it owns). For purposes of this Policy, WebMD's professional Web sites include <a href="http://www.medscape.com" target="_blank">www.medscape.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.emedicine.com" target="_blank">www.emedicine.com</a> (referred to as the "WebMD Professional Sites"). Reference to "Medscape" means Medscape, LLC, including any company that Medscape controls (for example a subsidiary that it owns), and Medscape's professional Web sites include <a href="http://www.medscapecme.com" target="_blank">www.medscapecme.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.theheart.org" target="_blank">www.theheart.org</a> (referred to as the "Medscape Professional Sites" and referred to together with the WebMD Professional Sites as the "Professional Sites"). Reference to "we" or "our" means WebMD and Medscape. We may share information among the subsidiaries of WebMD Health Corp. (the parent company of both WebMD and Medscape) and the respective Professional Sites that we each own or control, but it is always protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>You can visit our <a href="http://www.wbmd.com/" target="_blank">corporate site</a> at www.wbmd.com to learn more about WebMD and Medscape, obtain investor information, and obtain contact information.</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>

<p>As this Privacy Policy changes in significant ways, we will take steps to inform you of the changes. Minor changes to this Privacy Policy may occur that will not affect the ways in which we each use your personally identifiable information. In these instances, we may not inform you of such minor changes. When this Privacy Policy changes in a way that significantly affects the way we handle personal information, we will not apply the new Policy to information we have previously collected from you without giving you a choice as to whether or not we can apply the new Policy to your information going forward.</p>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

<p>In this section of our Privacy Policy, we discuss the different types of information that WebMD and Medscape may collect about you, and the ways in such information may be collected.</p>

<h4>Information We Collect from Unregistered Visitors</h4>

<p>You must register to access all of the Services provided through the Professional Sites, however, visitors to our Professional Sites can access the home pages and browse some areas of the Sites without disclosing any personally identifiable information. However, we do track non-personal information (i.e., information that is not traced back to any individual and is not used on its own to identify an individual) provided to us by your browser when you visit one of these Sites, even if you have not registered, including the referring site, the type of browser you use, the time and date that you accessed the Site.</p>

<h4>Information We Collect When You Register</h4>

<p>When you register for the Services, you are asked to provide identifying information such as your name, e-mail address, zip code, and other professional information (e.g., specialty). You will also be given a choice about whether or not you want to receive newsletters and other information sent to registered members from time to time. If any of the Professional Sites request additional personally identifiable information from you, and the owner of that Site wishes to use such personally identifiable information (or personally identifiable information that you have previously provided) in a manner not otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, the Site will explain how such personally identifiable information will be used and request your consent to any such collection and use.</p>

<h4>Continuing Medical Education</h4>
<p>When you register for a Continuing Medical Education (CME) or a Continuing Education (CE) activity through one of Medscape's Professional Sites, Medscape will collect certain personally identifiable information from you such as your name and mailing address. If you are a nurse or a pharmacist and wish to receive CE credit, you are also required to provide the state in which you are licensed and your license number. In addition to personally identifiable information, Medscape also collects aggregated non-personal information about the activities undertaken by users of the Medscape Professional Sites. Medscape will use the information that it collects in connection with its CME/CE activities in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medscape is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians. As an ACCME accredited entity, Medscape is required to periodically submit to the ACCME and other accrediting bodies aggregated data about CME participants and the CME activities that Medscape certifies. Medscape also provides personally identifiable information to other accredited CME/CE providers who certify CME/CE activities posted on its Web sites, as necessary for their fulfillment of their reporting obligations to the ACCME and other accrediting bodies. These reports may include personally identifiable information about you and credits issued to you, for the purpose of maintaining records that you can request from the accredited provider for up to six (6) years;</li>
<li>Supporters of CME/CE activities on Medscape's Professional Sites will receive only aggregated data about CME/CE activities that are relevant to their interests and/or the activities they support; and</li>
</ul>
<p>Medscape's Editorial and Customer Support Staff will have internal access to files containing personally identifiable information, including evaluation forms and aggregated CME /CE participant information. These files can be accessed in order to respond to your questions or comments. Medscape's staff may also use personally identifiable information, including registration information and evaluation data, in assessing educational needs and evaluating activities.</p>

<h4>Information from Outside Sources</h4>

<p>We may collect additional information about registered users from third party sources to assist us in providing the Services. For example, we use such information to verify and update registration information and confirm licensure status.</p>

<h4>Other Information</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion Boards:</strong> When you post a message to a discussion board on one of the Professional Sites, the alias that you set up will be available for all registered users to see. An alias consists of your username, specialty and geographic information and other information you agree to show in a profile to others. You should not post any information to one of our discussion boards or other public forums if you want to keep such information private or you are required by law to keep such information private. Information you post to discussion boards is considered public information and may be used by third parties including WebMD and Medscape, as further described in the Terms of Use for the Professional Sites. <br><br></li>

<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Clinical tools may be available on some of the Professional Sites. These tools may require you to provide information for the tools to operate. These tools may store information that you provide on our servers. <br><br></li>

<li><strong>Additional Forms and Emails:</strong> We may also ask you to provide additional information after you register if you want to obtain additional services or information or to resolve complaints or concerns.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Market Research:</strong> From time to time our market research department may directly or through a third party contractor acting on our behalf, invite you to participate in market research surveys through an email invitation, on-site pop-up or some other means. When participating in a survey, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information. We may combine this personally identifiable information with information that you have already provided at registration or that we have received from third party sources, as described in this Privacy Policy. This personally identifiable information is used by WebMD for research purposes. Aggregate information from the survey results may be reported to third parties including the survey sponsor, if applicable. Personally identifiable information that we collect through market research surveys will not be given or sold to any other third party without your consent or as otherwise allowed by this Privacy Policy. Some surveys may provide remuneration to participants for time spent participating in the survey. If you receive remuneration for your participation in a sponsored survey, the sponsor may require us to provide personally identifiable information about you for its recordkeeping and regulatory reporting purposes.<br><br></li>
</ul>

<h4>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>

<p>We collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Professional Sites through the use of cookies. A cookie is a small data file that your browser allows us to place on your computer's hard drive so we can associate you with the computer you are using. Our Professional Sites are designed to assign a cookie to every computer that accesses a Professional Site to: (i) track usage across the Professional Sites; (ii) help us dynamically generate advertising and content on Web pages, (iii) allow us to statistically monitor how many people are using the Professional Sites; (iv) track how many people open our emails; and (v) assess which features of the Services and Web pages are accessed. If you are a registered user of the Professional Sites, we may elect to associate your registration information with our cookies. Associating a cookie with your registration data allows us to provide more customized content, including advertisements, and enhance site personalization and functionality.</p>

<p>Your Web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, Web sites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the Web site, and some Web site functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies.</p>

<p>We may use Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Professional Sites and to track your use of special promotions and newsletters that we send to you. Also, we may use Web beacons and cookies to serve you targeted advertisements on other Web sites owned and operated by WebMD. Web beacons are tiny graphic image files, embedded in a Web page that provide a presence on the Web page and send back to the home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser, or some other third party) certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of a Web site which may be used to place cookies on your computer, as described above.</p>

<p>WebMD contracts with third parties whose Web beacons we place on our Professional Sites to assist us in targeting our advertising that is served to you on Web sites that are not owned and operated by WebMD. These web beacons place cookies on your browser in order to enable the third parties to collect non-personally identifiable information about you. These third parties have agreed not to use any non-personally identifiable information that they may collect through their use of these cookies except to deliver advertisements on our behalf. If your browser is set to reject cookies, this non-personally identifiable information will not be sent to these third parties.</p>

<p>Sponsors or advertisers on the WebMD Professional Sites may use their own cookies, Web beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the WebMD Professional Sites. Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their ads on the WebMD Professional Sites and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookies or Web beacons on the WebMD Professional Sites.</p>

<p>WebMD does not control these third parties' use of cookies or Web beacons, or how they manage the non-personally identifiable information they gather through them. However, WebMD does require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who we authorize to collect cookie or Web beacon information through a WebMD Professional Site to agree that they will not collect any personally identifiable information from the WebMD Professional Sites through these means. Further, they have agreed that they will not link any non-personal cookie or Web beacon information that they collect from the WebMD Professional Sites to personally identifiable information that they or others collect in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program or except as you may have agreed with the third party placing the cookie or Web beacon. You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our Professional Sites to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or Web beacons on their own sites. Certain Ad Servers and third party firms that facilitate the serving of advertisements based on your browsing activities on the Internet allow you to prevent them from collecting data or serving advertisements through the use of their cookies. In order to do so, you must opt-out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can opt-out of Cookies for several Ad Servers and marketing analytics firms by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> gateway opt-out site. This Web site will also allow you to review the privacy policies of these Ad Servers and marketing analytics firms.</p>

<h4>Children's Privacy</h4>

<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Professional Sites are designed and intended for use by adults, and are not intended for, nor designed to be used by children under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we know is a child under the age of 18.</p>

<h3>Uses and Disclosures We Make of Information</h3>

<p>In this section of our Privacy Policy, we identify the ways we may use information about you that we have collected. In general, the personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with the Services will be used to provide the services you have requested or authorized.</p>

<h4>Aggregate Data</h4>

<p>WebMD and Medscape create aggregate data about visitors to the WebMD Professional Sites and Medscape Professional Sites, respectively, for product development and improvement activities. We also use it for market analysis. We may provide information from each of our Professional Sites in aggregate form, with identifying information removed, to third parties. For example, we may tell a client what percentage of our registered users resides in a particular geographical area. When aggregated information is provided, we pool it from many individual records and strip it of any data that could be used to identify an individual before it is used. Any third party that receives aggregated information must agree not to attempt to re-identify the people it belongs to. For example, WebMD may provide a potential advertiser of a diabetes-related product information on the WebMD Professional Sites about the number of registered members of the WebMD Professional Sites that have identified themselves as endocrinologists. Depending on our agreement with the third parties, we may or may not charge for this information.</p>

<h4>Marketing and Advertising</h4>

<p>WebMD may target its advertising and marketing (e.g., through e-mail and on-site communications) based on information that you provide when you when you register and information that we receive from third party sources, as described in this Privacy Policy. For example, a user that WebMD knows is a cardiologist may be served cardiology-related advertisements on both WebMD-owned and third party sites that a neurologist will not see, or a user that WebMD knows is a healthcare professional who treats diabetes may be served advertisements for new diabetes therapies that other users would not see (although in neither case will the advertiser have access to any personally identifiable information about you). We serve these ads through the use of cookies and beacons, as described above.</p>

<p>WebMD and Medscape may also personalize the Professional Sites based on your interests. For example, you may see different articles in different places on www.medscape.com based on information you have shared with WebMD, information that WebMD has obtained by observing your previous activity, or information that WebMD has received from third party sources, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>Third Parties</h4>

<p>In addition to aggregate information (discussed previously), WebMD and Medscape may each share some kinds of personally identifiable information with third parties as described below.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Other Companies:</strong> We have strategic relationships with other companies who offer products and services on the Professional Sites. When you are interacting with those companies, different rules and privacy policies may apply and will be presented to you at such time.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Companies and People Who Work for Us:</strong> WebMD and Medscape each contract with other companies and individuals to help us provide our respective services. For example, we may host some of our Professional Sites on another company's computers, hire technical consultants to maintain any Web-based health tools, or work with companies to remove repetitive information from customer lists, analyze data or provide marketing assistance (including assisting us in targeting our advertisements as described herein), customer service or fulfillment services. In addition, if you are a healthcare professional, we may validate your licensure status and other information against available databases that list licensed health care professionals. In order to perform their jobs, these other companies may have limited access to some of the personally identifiable information we maintain about users of the Professional Sites. We require all such companies to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to limit their access to any personal information to the minimum necessary to perform their obligations, and not to use the information they may access for purposes other than fulfilling their responsibilities to us.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes WebMD sends offers to selected groups of users on behalf of other businesses. When WebMD does this, it does not give that business your name and address. WebMD provides a variety of mechanisms for you to tell it that you do not want to receive such promotional offers.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>"Information from Industry" Programs:</strong> From time to time, WebMD may offer you the opportunity to participate in industry-sponsored informational programs. These sponsored programs consist of sponsor-selected materials and will be identified to you as either <em>Information from Industry</em> or some similar designation. Examples of <em>Information from Industry</em> programs ("Industry Programs") include <em>Infosites</em>, custom-developed content areas on www.medscape.com featuring branded or unbranded sponsored content, and <em>eDetails</em>, promotional interactive online programs that provide clinical education and information to physicians about medical conditions, treatments and products. When you participate in an Industry Program, we may collect personally identifiable information about you that you provide voluntarily (e.g., postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) which may be used to supplement information about you that we have already received during member registration. In addition, we may collect information about a transaction that you have requested (e.g., sample request, sales rep visit, etc.), responses to Industry Program questions, and/or gift issuance. Even if you do not provide us with personally identifiable information, we collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of Industry Programs through cookies and beacons, as described above. <br><br> 
The personally identifiable information that you provide when you participate in an Industry Program will be used to provide the services you have requested or authorized. We use your personally identifiable information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific services you select, and send you emails about new programs and selected information from industry as it relates to your specialty or area of clinical practice. We may send you invitations to participate in other Industry Programs from the same sponsor. In most cases, WebMD will provide certain personally identifiable information about your participation in the Industry Program to the Industry Program's sponsor and/or its agent(s) on the sponsor's behalf. You should read the privacy policy of the applicable sponsor and familiarize yourself with how such sponsor will treat your information. WebMD is not responsible for how the sponsor and the sponsor's agent(s) will treat your privacy or their use of your information. Further, we may use non-personally identifiable information for research purposes, and we may provide this information in the aggregate to third parties. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of an Industry Program and the activities they conduct while engaged in the Program. <br><br></li>

<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If WebMD or Medscape transfers a business unit (such as a subsidiary) or an asset (such as a Web site) to another company, that company will be required to honor the applicable terms of this Privacy Policy.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may release account and other personally identifiable information when we believe release (1) is required to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) is reasonable in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. <br><br></li>

<li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may release personally identifiable information to a third party in accordance with your consent, subject to the purposes and limits that we disclose when we request your consent. For example, when you choose to participate in an Industry Program, we will provide certain personally identifiable information to the sponsor of such program, as further described above.<br><br></li>
</ul>

<p>If we discover that a third party inadvertently disclosed personally identifiable information about any of our users, we will take immediate action to prevent further occurrences.</p>

<h3>Security of Information</h3>

<p>In this section of our Privacy Policy, we discuss the security measures we take to protect information that we have collected about you.</p>

<h4>General Policies</h4>

<p>We have implemented technology and security policies, rules and other measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from unauthorized access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction, and accidental loss. We also protect your information by requiring that all our employees and others who have access to or are associated with the processing of your data respect your confidentiality.</p>

<p>We use security methods to determine the identity of registered users, so that appropriate rights and restrictions can be enforced for that user. Reliable verification of user identity is called authentication. We use both passwords and usernames to authenticate users. Users are responsible for maintaining their own passwords.</p>

<h4>Employees</h4>
<p>Employees are required to keep your information private, as a condition of their employment with us. Only selected, authorized employees are permitted to access health information.</p>
<p>All employees and contractors must abide by our Privacy Policy, and those who violate that policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of their employment and legal action.</p>

<h3>Access to Information and Choices</h3>

<p>In this section of this Privacy Policy, we tell you how to obtain and correct information we have about you, and how to choose what types of information you may share with us.</p>

<h4>Correction of Information We Have About You</h4>

<p>If you believe that there are errors in the registration information associated with your account, you may edit your personal profile any time that you like. You can directly edit your user profile on the Professional Site on which you initially registered. Requests for deletion of your record may result in your removal from the registry, but we may keep certain demographic information about you for product improvement purposes. You may contact Customer Support and ask for the changes that you would like to make.</p>
