The personal information collected by us, or on our behalf, shall be limited to those details necessary for the purposes described below unless these are obvious to you or within your reasonable expectation. In general, we collect, use, and disclose information for the following purposes: to provide the products and services you request; to tell you about other products and services offered by MediaTek; to manage our sites and services; to administer and process any request for information or job application; to comply with our ethical, regulatory and legal obligations or requirements, including compliance with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process, or for the purposes of a government or regulatory investigation; or to protect or defend the rights or property of MediaTek. 

In general, when browsing our website, you are not required to give us your Personal Information. However, MediaTek may collect, store, and/or use Personal Information such as your name, address, work or business your work for, phone number, email address, or other information, when you voluntarily submit it to us - for example, when you request information about our products or when you submit an employment application online. We may use this Personal Information to delete your requests for information or to contact you. 

We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf. Examples include HR recruiting, an email service provider, and investor portals on our site. In so doing, we may need to share your Personal Information with them. We provide our service providers with only the Personal Information they need to perform their services and we require that they protect this information and not use it for any other purpose. Except under the circumstances described above, MediaTek will not share or disclose Personal Information to any third party for promotional purposes without your permission. In no even will MediaTek sell, rent, share, trade or disclose Personal Information to any third party without your permission. 

In the event that we acquire an entity (such as through a merger or acquisition), we may use and/or disclose Personal Information of prospective employees to third parties in connection with the proposed transaction for the purposes of evaluating and/or performing the proposed transaction, and you consent to such disclosure. These purposes may include, for example, receiving advice on whether to proceed or continue with the transaction, fulfilling any reporting or audit requirements to such parties, and/or disclosing Personal Information as part of concluding a sale or transfer of assets. In the event a transaction is not concluded, we will require, by contract, any third parties not to use or disclose Personal Information in any manner whatsoever for any purpose, and to return or destroy such Personal Information.
