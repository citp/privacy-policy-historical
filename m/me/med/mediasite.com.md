Sonic Foundry only collects personally identifiable information when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. Sonic Foundry will make every reasonable effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

We will only send you Sonic Foundry email related to the specific topics designated in [your preferences](http://www.mysofo.com/forms/updatepreferences/). New categories of communications may be added from time to time.

You may opt out of receiving these communications, or unsubscribe, at any time by following the instructions in the email footer or [managing your preferences](http://www.mysofo.com/forms/updatepreferences/). 

Most of our newsletters are quarterly, with the exception of our customer and partner newsletters, which are monthly and are the primary venue for us to update you on product and service developments. In addition, in accordance with [your preferences](http://www.mysofo.com/forms/updatepreferences/), we may send you occasional invitations to participate in webinars, attend upcoming events or review the results of new research, best practice announcements or case studies. You can modify [your preferences](http://www.mysofo.com/forms/updatepreferences/) at any time to add or remove yourself from these subscriptions.
