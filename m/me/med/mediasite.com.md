# Mediasite.com | Privacy Policy

### Information Collection

Mediasite.com only collects personally identifiable information when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. Mediasite.com will make every reasonable effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Sonic Foundry can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. 

### Information Sharing

In its sole discretion, Sonic Foundry may sell or trade your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, including successors in interest. If you do not want your information used in this manner, you may contact Sonic Foundry and "opt out" of receiving future marketing information about other products, services, and offerings from Sonic Foundry and/or any third parties. 

However, even if you opt out of receiving any communications from Sonic Foundry, we reserve the right sell your information to a successor in interest or a purchaser of our assets. We also reserve the right to contact you regarding your account status and any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our records on you. 

Sonic Foundry may perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics. We may share this information with advertisers. Sonic Foundry may sometimes permit third parties to offer products or services through a Sonic Foundry site. Sonic Foundry is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties, and you should check the applicable privacy policy of any third party when providing personally identifiable information. 

Sonic Foundry may also disclose your information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with Sonic Foundry's rights or property or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

### Cookies

Sonic Foundry has no control over these external sites or their content, and cannot be held responsible for any actions they may take or any information they might collect. You may arrive at one of these sites through clicking on a banner advertisement, as part of a co-branding arrangement, or simply by selecting a link on a Sonic Foundry web page. These sites might issue their own cookies or collect data or personal information. Use caution when visiting an external site. 

The foregoing policies are effective as of October 27, 2003. Sonic Foundry reserves the right to change this policy at any time. By using this site, you signify your assent to the Sonic Foundry Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site.

###  How do I prevent my Mediasite content from being indexed by Mediasite.com and other search engines? 

The mediasite.com search engine (MiteBot) obeys the [Robot Exclusion Standard](http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html). MiteBot will obey all entries in the robots.txt file located at a website's root directory with a User-agent containing "MiteBot" or "*".

Disallowed documents, including slash (the home page of the site), are not indexed. If a page has robots.txt entries disallowing it to be crawled, mediasite.com will not use the contents of that page. 

Example robots.txt:

# Disallow the mediasite.com search engine   
User-agent: MiteBot  
Disallow: /mediasite/viewer 

# Disallow all search engines  
User-agent: *  
Disallow: /mediasite/viewer
