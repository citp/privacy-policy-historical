								<div class="topic">In order to create and maintain a customized community toolbar using the Conduit on-line platform provided in the Website, you must first complete a registration form within the Conduit toolbar creation Wizard. During this registration you are required to provide a user name, a password and a valid email address which are all necessary for identifying your toolbar and for validating your registration.

For example, if you do not wish to receive any additional marketing materials from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form. 
If you no longer wish to receive our email updates, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each update or by emailing us at:

Upon such a use, the toolbar user will be referred to a designated page hosted on the Website allowing the user to send an email notification to his friend or to any other entity of his choice. 
If you choose to use our service to tell a friend about our site or toolbar, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Conduit uses this information for the sole purpose of sending and tracking the delivery of this one-time email. Conduit erases all third party email address provided using the “Tell-A-Friend” feature from its servers at least once a month.
