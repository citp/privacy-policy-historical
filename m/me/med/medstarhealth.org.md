This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information.

Please review it carefully.

#### Who Will Follow This Notice

MedStar Health, Inc. and its affiliated entities and subsidiaries are separate legal entities. However, they are under common ownership and control, and thus have organized themselves as a single **Affiliated Covered Entity** ( **ACE** ) for the purposes of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This status permits MedStar Health, its affiliated entities, and subsidiaries to maintain a single _Notice of Privacy Practices._ This notice describes the health information practices of the MedStar Health Inc, organization. All entities, sites and locations will follow the terms of this notice. In addition, these entities, sites and locations may share medical information with each other for treatment, payment and healthcare operations as described in this notice.

#### Our Obligation to You

We value the privacy of your medical information as an important part of our "patient first" pledge. We view the protection of patient privacy as an essential component of our vision to be the _Trusted Leader in Caring for People and Advancing Health_ and our mission to serve our patients. We strive to use only the minimum amount of your health information necessary for the purposes described in this Notice of Privacy Practice (“Notice”).

We collect information from you and use it to provide you with quality care, and to comply with certain legal requirements. We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information, and to give you this Notice of our legal duties, our privacy practices, and your rights. We are required to follow the terms of our most current Notice. When we disclose information to other persons and companies to perform services for us, we will require them to protect your privacy. There are other laws we will follow that may provide additional protections, such as laws related to mental health, alcohol and other substance abuse, and communicable disease or other health conditions.

This Notice covers the following sites and people: all health care professionals authorized to enter information into your chart, all volunteers authorized to help you while you are here, all of our associates and on- site contractors, all departments and units within the hospital, all health care students, all health care delivery facilities and providers within the MedStar Health system, and your personal doctor and others while they are providing care at this site. Your doctor may have different policies or notices about the health information that was created in his or her private office or clinic
