**Cookies**

MediaFunnel uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, MediaFunnel’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to MediaFunnel, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.

Session cookies are required to use the Service.

MediaFunnel uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web sites. When you purchase the Service or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
