We may use web beacons to im-prove user experiences on the Sites and learn more about our customers and visitors to the Sites. Web Beacons collect only limited information which includes a cookie number; time and date of a page view; and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon re-sides. Web becons do not contain any Personal Information.
