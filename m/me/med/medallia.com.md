## Medallia Experience Cloud Notice

#### Effective Date May 30, 2018 - Last Reviewed and Updated May 30, 2018

### Introduction

This notice addresses the data Medallia collects to provide our SaaS platform and services to our clients. Clients use this platform to collect customer feedback through different channels, including surveys and integrations with other platforms. Medallia also provides reporting applications that allow our clients to view and analyze the collected feedback.

In our privacy notice, we use the following terms:

  * “Medallia Experience Cloud” refers to the SaaS platform and provision of professional services we provide to our clients.
  * “client” refers to a business to which Medallia provides its services and SaaS platform, such as those listed at https://www.medallia.com/customers/;
  * “customer” refers to an individual who has had an interaction with a Medallia client and whose feedback is collected through the Medallia Experience Cloud. Customer interactions can span a wide variety, and include purchasing goods or services, contacting customer support, checking in to a hotel or property, and visiting a client’s web page or using its mobile app.
  * “respondent” refers to an individual who is prompted to provide feedback to one of Medallia’s clients through the Medallia Experience Cloud.



### What Data We Collect and How We Collect It

**Medallia’s and our Clients’ Roles in Data Collection.** In providing the Medallia Experience Cloud to our clients, Medallia collects data only according to our clients’ instructions. Our clients specify what customers we should contact to provide feedback, when we should contact them (for example, after completing a purchase at a client’s retail store), how we should contact them (for example, email or SMS), how often we should send them reminders to provide feedback, and what questions are asked. Medallia’s clients also decide whether to use inbound or outbound data integrations, and how to use or respond to feedback that is collected.

Medallia enters into agreements with our clients that legally obligate Medallia to protect data we receive or are directed to collect, and use it only to provide the products and services specified by the client. Under many data protection laws, including those in Europe, Medallia is considered a “data processor” to our clients, and our clients are considered “data controllers.” As data controllers, Medallia clients are responsible for complying with laws that may require notice, disclosure or consent related to the transfer of data to Medallia or its use in the Medallia Experience Cloud.

For more information on the types of data collected by a particular Medallia client, refer to the privacy notice or communications of the Medallia client. Our clients’ privacy notices are commonly located in the Medallia survey invitation (for web-based surveys) or on the client’s web site or mobile application (for digital surveys).

**Legal Basis for Processing.** Medallia clients provide instructions with regard to the upload, collection, transfer, and access of personal data in the Medallia Experience Cloud. As such, Medallia clients determine the legal basis they have for data processing. Medallia clients can use legitimate interest or consent as a legal basis for processing personal data in the Medallia Experience Cloud, although others may apply. For more information, refer to the privacy notice or communications of the Medallia client.

**Identity of the Data Controller**. As data controllers, Medallia clients are responsible for identifying themselves, where appropriate, in communications sent by the Medallia Experience Cloud. For example, Medallia survey invitations sent by email or SMS should identify the name of the Medallia client who directs us to conduct the survey. If you are having trouble identifying the data controller associated with a particular Medallia survey, please contact Medallia survey support [here](http://surveysupport.medallia.com/s/contactsupport).

**Web-based Surveys.** In web-based surveys offered by the Medallia Experience Cloud, customers or employees receive a survey invitation and respond to the survey in a web interface. To send survey invitations Medallia clients can, for example, provide the Medallia Experience Cloud customer names, email addresses, and information about the customers’ interactions with their business (e.g., the name of the client’s store where the customer shopped). In addition, Medallia clients can provide the Medallia Experience Cloud with information that segments customers into groups, such as the type of account the customer holds, the type of product or service purchased, or the whether the customer is enrolled in a loyalty program.

When a respondent navigates to a Medallia web-based survey, Medallia collects the respondent’s IP address, the date and time the respondent accessed the survey, survey responses (typically numerical scores and narrative text responses), how far the user has navigated in the survey, and the type of device and web browser the customer used to access the survey. In some surveys, clients also direct Medallia to collect the geographical location of the customer’s device that is used to access the survey.

**Digital Surveys**. In these surveys, customers are prompted to respond to a survey within a client’s digital channels, such as a web page or mobile application. Clients can configure these surveys to:

  * prompt customers for information such as name, email, a survey score, and a narrative text response to a prompt;
  * collect analytics information (such as the customer’s IP address and type of web browser or mobile device);
  * collect customer ID (such as the login name or email the customer uses to access the client’s web site or mobile application); and
  * allow customers to take a screenshot that captures portions of the client’s web page or mobile application.



**Integrations.** Clients can integrate other tools, processes or platforms as inbound sources of data for the Medallia Experience Cloud, such as CRM platforms or marketing tools . Medallia clients control what data is stored in the Medallia Experience Cloud from these integrations. For more information, refer to the privacy notice or the communications of the Medallia client.

Clients can also configure the Medallia Experience Cloud as an outbound source of data for other tools, processes, or platforms, such as collaboration tools. Clients and any third parties associated with those tools, processes, or platforms are responsible for managing personal data outside the Medallia Experience Cloud. For example, clients can configure surveys to prompt customers to write reviews on third-party websites. If a customer chooses to submit a review for publication on that third-party site, any information the customer provides on that site is governed by the privacy notice or communications of that site.

**Medallia Reporting Applications**. Medallia provides clients web-based and mobile applications that are used by employees of Medallia clients to review and analyze customer feedback (referred to as “reporting applications” in this notice). To provide their employees access to these applications, clients can send Medallia employee names, identifiers (e.g., an employee ID), job title or function, and the store or business location they are associated with.

When an employee accesses a Medallia reporting application, Medallia collects the employee’s user name, IP address of the device used to access the reporting application, geographic area associated with the IP address, type of web browser and mobile device, time and date that the reporting application was accessed, and areas of the reporting application that were visited. Employees can also leave notes on feedback records.

**Social Media Features and Widgets.** Clients can configure surveys to include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the “share this” button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy notice or privacy-specific communications of the company providing them.

**Information Medallia Does Not Collect.** Unless configured by a client to do so, the Medallia Experience Cloud does not collect sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or government identification numbers, nor does it collect information defined as “sensitive personal data” under EU law, such as race, sexual orientation, or union membership.

### How Personal Data is Used

**By Medallia and Partners.** Medallia uses personal data gathered in the Medallia Experience Cloud to provide the SaaS platform and services for which the client has engaged Medallia.

These uses can include contacting a client’s customers to provide feedback for web-based and digital surveys, providing gathered feedback and assisting the customer in managing data in the Medallia Experience Cloud, and analyzing the data gathered to improve the client’s business.

**Medallia Clients**. Medallia clients can use personal data collected in the Medallia Experience Cloud to improve their customers’ experiences with their business. Clients can use Medallia’s reporting applications to provide customer feedback to their front line employees, as well as managers and executives. Clients can also perform analysis in customer feedback to prioritize and make operational changes to their business, and use personal data gathered in the Medallia Experience Cloud to send follow-up communications customers.

### Who Accesses Personal Data

**Medallia Professional Services and Support**. When a Medallia client engages Medallia’s professional services teams, Medallia professional services employees in Medallia’s Group Companies can access personal data of that client to perform work associated with tasks described above. If there is a support request, troubleshooting issue, or technical error (e.g., bug or product malfunction) that requires access to personal data, Medallia support and engineering staff in the Group Companies who are needed to address the issue will access that data.

Access to personal data stored in the Medallia Experience Cloud is provided using systems, procedures and controls approved by Medallia’s security team. Access is provided only as long as needed to perform the necessary work.

**Third Party Professional Services, Servicing and Support**. If permitted by a client, Medallia can use third parties to provide support for respondents and employees. Medallia clients can also provide access to the Medallia Experience Cloud to third party partners to perform systems integration, consulting, market research or servicing. For examples of Medallia’s professional services partners, see <https://www.medallia.com/partners/>.

**Medallia Clients**. Medallia clients can provide their employees access to the Medallia Experience Cloud so that they can view and analyze gathered feedback. For more information, please contact the appropriate Medallia client.

**Third-Party Technology Providers**. Medallia transfers personal data as needed to vendors who provide our help desk ticketing software, support our technical operations (including vendors who assist us with web and mobile visitor analytics and SaaS event logging), assist with data transmission (including content delivery networks), and provide data storage. Depending on the technology integrations or features chosen by a Medallia client, we also transfer personal data of our client’s respondents as needed to provide the integrations or features (including, for example, interactive voice response, SMS, machine translation, or screen capture features).

Third parties that are provided access to personal data in the Medallia Experience Cloud are evaluated by TAG’s vendor risk management program and agree to appropriate security and data processing agreements with them.

**Security**. Medallia maintains a comprehensive security program with appropriate organizational and technical security practices measures to protect data stored in the Medallia Experience Cloud. For more details, visit <https://www.medallia.com/security/>.

**Storage Period**. The data of a Medallia client is retained in the Medallia Experience Cloud until the termination of the client’s subscription, unless earlier deleted or modified per the client’s request.

**Data Subject Rights (for EEA individuals).** The Medallia Experience Cloud provides clients tools and processes for data modification, export, or deletion. If you are a respondent who wants to modify, access, or delete personal data associated with you in the Medallia Experience Cloud, please contact the appropriate Medallia client.

**Opt Out and Withdrawal of Consent**. Medallia offers its clients opt-out mechanisms to include in communications to individuals. Respondents who exercise an opt-out will be added to Medallia’s opt-out list for the relevant client as required by applicable law. For each client, Medallia does not send survey invitations to any e-mail address on the applicable opt-out list. Medallia may also provide its opt-out lists to clients and their agents on a timely basis so that they may, where appropriate, update their records. If you are a respondent who wishes to withdraw your consent from all data processing by a particular Medallia client, please contact the client.
