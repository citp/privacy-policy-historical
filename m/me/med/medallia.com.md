# Privacy Policy - Medallia

Effective date: September 24, 2004 • Last reviewed and updated September 30, 2015

[](http://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Medallia,-Inc-/validation?rid=97940707-77d5-495c-94ba-4b8bf361f4ee "TRUSTe")

Medallia, Inc. (“Medallia”) is committed to safeguarding the privacy of your personally identifiable information (“PII”). This statement sets forth Medallia’s privacy policy. The policy complies with the privacy principles of TRUSTe, in which Medallia is a member.

For the purposes of this policy, Medallia defines the term “client” as a business with which Medallia has an established relationship, “customer” as a customer of a Medallia client, and “respondent” as an individual who takes Medallia’s surveys independent of Medallia’s clients.

This privacy policy covers how Medallia handles personally identifiable information, including personally identifiable information associated with the URLs Medallia.com and guest-survey.net.

**Safe Harbor Framework**

Medallia complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Medallia has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  Medallia’s designated provider for alternative dispute resolution under the Safe Harbor is TRUSTe.

**Information Medallia Collects**

Medallia collects survey and other market research data about individuals’ usage of products and services. The data is used by Medallia clients to improve their products and services.

Medallia does not receive, use or collect personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses, except under the following circumstances:

When an existing or prospective client goes to www.medallia.com to request a demonstration of a Medallia product, he or she must provide contact details including person-specific information (name, title, phone number and e-mail address) and organization-specific information (name and address). Medallia uses this information solely for the purpose of contacting the interested party and scheduling demonstrations and providing information about Medallia products and services.

When Medallia surveys customers on behalf of its clients, it receives customers’ personally identifiable information from its clients. Medallia enters into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with clients that legally obligate Medallia to protect the personally identifiable customer information it receives and use it only for the purposes specified in the contract. From time to time Medallia may collect personally identifiable information during a survey, if requested to do so by a client. This personally identifiable information will be shared with the client, and will be used as described in that survey.

Medallia may, with the written consent of its clients, ask questions of customers for whom it has received personally identifiable information, and bundle and sell those responses in an aggregate form. Before providing any survey results to third parties, responses are stripped of personally identifying or client-identifying information, aggregated, and adjusted using Medallia’s proprietary methodologies.

When Medallia surveys respondents on its own behalf, it typically does not collect or have any other access to personally identifying information. If Medallia does request personally identifiable information during a survey, it will use the personally identifiable information as described in that survey. When Medallia provides resulting proprietary research to third parties, it sometimes reveals individual responses, but these do not contain any personally identifying information.

When collecting data from survey respondents on behalf of our clients, Medallia does not collect sensitive personally identifiable information such as: credit card numbers, social security numbers, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. Medallia does collect demographic information for statistical purposes. Responses to demographic questions are entirely voluntary.

Medallia’s mobile reporting application, used by Medallia’s clients, uses third-party services to gather data on application usage and stability. This data is shared only with the relevant client. A user may unsubscribe from tracking through the user settings screen within the mobile application.

Medallia and its service providers use cookies primarily to identify returning users from the same computer and ensure the integrity of its research. As part of its basic uses of Internet technology to provide surveys, Medallia also collects technical information such as: respondent IP address; the date and time at which respondents access Medallia’s website and respondent HTTP request headers.

**Registration information for Medallia Institute and Events**

When registering for a Medallia event or Medallia Institute course, you may be asked to provide a credit card number to fulfill your order. The credit card number and associated registration information will be collected and processed by a third-party vendor. You may also provide personal information about other people, such as their name and email address. This information is only used for the sole purpose of completing your request or for whatever reason it may have been provided.

**Location-based services**

Some of the surveys Medallia provides on behalf of its clients ask the clients’ customers to provide their location data, including the real-time geographic location of the customer’s device.  This data will only be collected with the customer’s consent.  The location based-data allows Medallia to provide surveys that related to a client’s specific store, restaurant, hotel or other business location. All such information will be shared only with the client on whose behalf dealt with in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
