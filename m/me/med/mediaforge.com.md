Who is mediaFORGE

mediaFORGE is a remarketing/retargeting tool for advertisers that collects anonymous usage data from visitors and users. The information we gather is completely anonymous. mediaFORGE uses the information to display targeted advertisements to Internet users. mediaFORGE does not provide any personal information to our advertisers when consumers interact with or view mediaFORGE ads. However, by interacting with or viewing a mediaFORGE ad consumers are consenting to the possibility that mediaFORGE will make the assumption that consumers meet certain targeting criteria. mediaFORGE may combine usage information with information we obtain from clients/advertisers, network partners, and/or other companies.

Information Gathering

mediaFORGE collects anonymous information through the use of cookies and pixel tags, which are industry standard technologies used by many major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.

When an Internet user views or interacts with mediaFORGE advertisements or a partner’s website we collect and store information about the interactions and usage.

Use of Anonymous Information

mediaFORGE uses the anonymous information it collects to customize the advertisements that consumers see on participating web sites and to analyze if the advertising resulted in sales. At times, we send our clients and partners the aggregated anonymous data for their use in determining which products and offers to display in their ads. The specific source of the data is not disclosed. Each member has warranted that the anonymous information they receive shall be used in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, mediaFORGE will also disclose this information in response to subpoenas, court orders and other required legal processes.

How Anonymous Information is Secured

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect data integrity, access and use.

Unforeseen Circumstances

mediaFORGE may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such transactions, the anonymous information we have collected from you may be one of the transferred business assets.

Right to Change This Policy

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. While we expect most changes to be minor, there may be changes that are more significant. As such, we will state the date the policy was last updated. We encourage you to review our privacy policy on a regular basis.

Opt-Out

There are many programs that allow you to manually delete your cookies. In addition, mediaFORGE offers consumers the opportunity to select a persistent "blank" or "opt-out cookie" to prevent information from being uniquely associated with your browser.
