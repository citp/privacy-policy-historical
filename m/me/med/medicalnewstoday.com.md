# MNT - Privacy Policy

We respect the confidentiality of information relating to our readers, as well as the laws governing the privacy of medical information that apply in the country and state where this website is located.

We also respect clarity of speech and have made an effort to clearly and simply explain to you how and why we and other third-parties use information collected about you when you visit this website.

In short: information identifying individual MNT visitors and account holders will not be disclosed by MNT staff to anyone unless specifically authorized by that individual. 

Your email address and personal details are never passed on, or sold, to third-parties. These details are used only to supply MNT services requested by you and for our own statistical analysis. 

For example, our email-a-friend service uses your name and email address, as well as the email address and name of the person you wish to forward an MNT news article to. We do not store this information, nor do we associate it with your MNT account, should you have one.

Please read the rest of the document to familiarize yourself with where and how we collect and use your data, as well as how our advertisers and other service providers deal with your personal data.

Please be aware that by continuing to use MNT, you consent to our useage of the methods described here.

## Our use of cookies

In order for us to count the number of people visiting MNT, a unique "cookie" may be placed in your web browser. The cookie settings that we use are automatically set to "allow all cookies" in order to give you the best visitor experience.

Here is a list of the cookies that we place, how long they are active for and why we use them: 

**MNT account "remember me"  
**If you check the "Remember me" box on any of our log-in forms, we will set a cookie to remember your email and password information for 14 days. This means that even if you close your web browser and come back at another time within 14 days, we'll automatically enter these details for you. After 14 days have passed, you'll have to check the box again in order to save your details for another 14 days.

**Mobile website override**  
We understand that not everyone wants to see a stripped-down version of our MNT when browsing a mobile device. So, if you click on the yellow "View desktop website" button at the bottom of every page when viewing MNT on a mobile device, we'll send you to the "full" version of MNT and set a cookie to remember your choice. Should you quit your mobile device's web browser, you'll be presented with the mobile version of MNT next time you visit us. 

Aside from these two cookies, we also track visitor IP addresses for the purposes of attaining demographic data and to aid us in reporting and stopping inappropriate use of the website.

Please see the sections below for further specific information on how our advertisers and other third-party partners collect and use information about you and your visit to MNT.

We use Google and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit MNT. These companies may use information ( _not_ including your name, address, email address or telephone number), about your visits to MNT and other websites. In addition, they may collect information about how you interact with content on these sites. 

They do this in order to provide advertisements on MNT and other websites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

## Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to gather anonymous data about our readers and how they use MNT. The information collected cannot be used by us to identify an individual reader. 

We use this information to aid our understanding of how our readers interact with MNT, as well as to help us to understand trends for things such as:

  * Our most popular articles each day, month, year.
  * How readers come to MNT (other news websites, email newsletters and search engines, etc.)
  * What kind of devices visitors use to read MNT.



As you can understand, this information is very useful and helps us to decide when we roll out new services and importantly, how we make sure that MNT is readable on the widest possible range of computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices. 

(At the time of writing, our reports showed that we had nearly 5,000 _different_ types of devices accessing MNT per month.)

Regardless of how useful this information it in allowing us to provide a better service to you, our reader, you may opt out of providing this information to Google Analyitics [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=None "External Link - Opens in new window").

## Quantcast Measurement

We use Quantcast Corporation's "Quantcast Measurement" service to measure website traffic and demographic data. MNT is a “Quantified” website, which means that when you visit MNT, Quantcast's servers automatically record and collect "log data" sent by your browser.

This "log data" includes your computer’s IP address and the referring HTTP location (how you arrived on the page you are reading).

Quantcast also may place or read cookies when you visit MNT, although your name, address, email address or telephone number are not tracked. 

Quantcast’s reporting is publicly viewable and you may see the results of Quantcast’s measurements of MNT's traffic at any time by [clicking here](https://www.quantcast.com/medicalnewstoday.com "External Link - Opens in new window : MNT at Quantcast").

## Twitter conversion tracking

We use Twitter's conversion tracking service to track interactions that Twitter users take after viewing or engaging with our ads on Twitter. 

This service allows us to analyze, compare and optimize our Twitter-based advertising campaigns when they are active.
