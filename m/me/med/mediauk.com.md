# This site and your privacy

### We take your privacy very seriously. Here's what we do with your details.

 **Data Protection Act 1998 (UK)**

This website is administered in the UK and hosted in Ireland. It is run by [Not At All Bad Ltd](http://notatallbad.ltd.uk/). Not At All Bad Ltd is registered in the UK under the Data Protection Act 1998. Our registration number is Z1084808. Our Data Controller is James Cridland - you can contact him at james.cridland@media.info. 

**Webservers and automatically-captured information**

media.info's main website is on heavily-cached Amazon Cloudfront infrastructure, which handles all the site traffic. When it needs a new page, Amazon Cloudfront asks our own webserver for it, and every visitor looks almost identical to our own webserver. We don't know what device you're using, or what IP address you are connecting from. We keep no logs. 

Amazon Cloudfront gives us country-level geotargeting information - "this user is in the UK" - to enable us to modify the website for your country's media. 

If you're logged in, Amazon Cloudfront passes us your logged-in user token, which enables us to know who you are. 

We use Google Analytics to help us monitor our traffic: no personally-identifiable information is kept by Google Analytics. Our Analytics code uses Google Analytics Advertising Features, including remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick platform integrations and demographics and interest reporting. Here is [their privacy policy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en-GB), and here's [how to opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). 

**Cookies**

This site uses cookies. If you do not accept cookies, you can still passively use the site. This cookie is essential, however, if you want to log in. Our [cookies](https://web.archive.org/cookies) page details what cookies we use and what they contain. 

**Email addresses and personal details**

To passively use our site, we do not need any personal information. 

To get email alerts, you must supply us with a valid e-mail address: we check this is valid before using it. When logging in to our site via a third party like Facebook, Google or LinkedIn, if you grant permission we get personal information from your account provider with your name, email address, and other basic information, including a photograph where you have this set. We copy this information using a secure link between our website and theirs; and update it every time you log in. We don't store your password. 

When creating a media.info Account, we require a valid email address, and we also ask for your real name and a password. We store the password encrypted in our database, using a relatively slow encrypting mechanism. 

In all of the above cases, we may use the e-mail address you have given us to e-mail you important information regarding your account and new services by media.info, not exceeding one e-mail a calendar month. These messages have a clear unsubscribe link where appropriate. We never share your details with any third party. 

When giving us feedback, in order for us to give you a reply we need your e-mail address. We also ask your name. Both of these pieces of information are not required. Your full e-mail address will not be seen by our staff: only the site administrator has access. 

**Email lists, unsubscribing, and measures against spam**

We never send [spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29). 

Our email alerts and media.info Accounts require a valid email address. You will be asked to check your email address and click on a URL we send you to ensure you're posting from a valid email address and that you have access to that email address - or you'll need to log in using a third party (like Facebook) which has already verified your email address. This is called [confirmed opt-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt_in_e-mail), and universally recognised as best practice. 

We want to make it easy to unsubscribe from our emails if you change your mind. Every one contains clear unsubscribe links. These trigger an 'unsubscribe' link in systems like Gmail, AOL, Hotmail and other email services, which we honour. 

To protect the health and reputation of our service, and ensure that all user details are correct, we monitor and agressively remove bouncing email addresses. If your email address bounces, your account or alerts may cease without warning or notification. 

While a UK company, we abide by the principles of the US 'CAN-SPAM' laws, and comply fully with the EU Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC. We do not give any of your information to any third party without your consent. 

**Release of personal details**

We do not give your details to any third party without your consent. However, by posting messages which could be considered as defamatory or libellous under English or European law, you are putting both yourselves and this website at risk. We reserve the right to release all available details to aid identification in case of legal action. We will not disclose them at any other time, and you will be notified if we wish to release them, and given every reasonable opportunity to settle the matter without recourse to release of information. 

**Advertising**

Our advertising is supplied by Google AdSense. It uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this website, and use cookies. These companies may use your visiting behaviour on this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you (rather than just giving you irrelevant advertising). Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. You can read more about this, and opt out of this cookie, by visiting [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

**Information held, and EU regulations**

The origin website and database is hosted in the EU by Amazon Web Services. Public media.info pages are variously hosted in the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, Philippines, S. Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia (typically the closest location to you). Email to @media.info, and some feedback from the website, is held on Google's email servers, which are both inside and outside the EU. 

**cloudfront.net**

These servers are Amazon Cloudfront servers, used to store static files. This uses no cookies. We do not collect logfiles. 

**Agreement**

By using this site, you signify your assent to this policy, and also to our copyright restrictions. If you do not agree, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
