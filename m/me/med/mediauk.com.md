# Privacy Policy - Media UK

_This was last updated 24 March 2009, reflecting changes requested by Google AdSense. There have been no material changes, for Media UK users, since July 2004._

**Data Protection Act 1998 (UK)**

This website is hosted in the UK, and run by [Not At All Bad Ltd](http://notatallbad.ltd.uk/). Not At All Bad Ltd is registered in the UK under the Data Protection Act 1998. Our registration number is Z1084808. Our Data Controller is James Cridland, who you can contact at james.cridland@mediauk.com. 

**Webservers and automatically-captured information**

Not At All Bad Ltd runs www.mediauk.com. This website automatically collects information about which pages are visited, browsers used, the domain name (e.g., aol.com) of visitors, and information about where the user has come from. We use this to dynamically write the site so that it's relevant to you, and we also use it for internal review and for traffic audits. We use Google Analytics to assist us, who have a separate privacy policy: no personally-identifiable information is kept by Google Analytics. 

**Cookies**

To help your surfing experience, this site uses cookies. Cookies are small files which help identify you to us when you ask for pages from our site. 

In our cookie we keep your userid, username, e-mail address, password, plus your session id, player preferences, and time of your last visit. Google Analytics also stores information here to assist in its analysis. 

If you do not accept cookies, you can still use the site, though access to areas requiring registration won't work. 

**Email addresses and personal details**

To passively use our site, we do not need your e-mail address. 

Full registrations are protected by a username and password, which is activated through e-mail. Media UK email services (like our jobs or news alerts) are activated through email. To use any of these services, you must supply us with a valid e-mail address. 

We may use the e-mail address you have given us to e-mail you important information regarding your account and new services by Media UK, not exceeding one e-mail a calendar month. To unsubscribe from these messages, please request closure of your account. 

Media UK dev discussion services store your IP address next to each posting you make, for our review only. 

We do not give any of your information to any third party without your consent. 

When giving us feedback, in order for us to give you a reply we need your e-mail address. (and we also ask your name). Both of these pieces of information are not required. You should also know that your full e-mail address will not be seen by Media UK dev staff: only the site administrator has access. 

**Email lists, unsubscribing, and measures against spam**

Media UK dev never sends [spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29). 

Our daily email alerts, discussion registrations and job postings all require a valid email address. You will be asked to check your email address and click on a URL we send you, to ensure you're posting from a valid email address and that you have access to that email address. This is called [confirmed opt-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt_in_e-mail), and universally recognised as best practice. 

We want to make it easy to unsubscribe from our daily email alerts. Every one contains an unsubscribe link at the bottom, and a further unsubscribe link in the List-Unsubscribe header, conforming with RFC2369. 

To protect the health and reputation of our service, and ensure that all user details are correct, we monitor and agressively remove bouncing email addresses. If your email address bounces, your subscriptions to our email alerts, or discussion membership, may cease without warning or notification. 

While a UK company, we abide by the principles of the US 'CAN-SPAM' laws, and comply fully with the EU Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC. We do not give any of your information to any third party without your consent. 

**Release of personal details**

By posting messages which could be considered as defamatory or libellous under English or European law, you are putting both yourselves and this website at risk. We reserve the right to release all available details to aid identification in case of legal action. We will not disclose them at any other time, and you will be notified if we wish to release them, and given every reasonable opportunity to settle the matter without recourse to release of information. 

YOU CANNOT USE THIS SITE TO POST LIBELLOUS, DEFAMATORY OR OTHERWISE ILLEGAL POSTINGS. 

**Advertising**

Our advertising is supplied by Google AdSense. Google AdSense uses some third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this website, and uses cookies. 

These companies may use your visiting behaviour on this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you (rather than just giving you irrelevant advertising). 

Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. You can read more about this, and opt out of this cookie, by visiting [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

**Information held, and EU regulations**

This website is hosted in the UK by Rackspace. Limited information (never any passwords) may be transferred on registration via email to Google's email servers, held in the US, but regularly deleted. Email to @mediauk.com is held on Google (admin@); other @mediauk.com addresses forward to email addresses held on a variety of systems. 

**mediauk.net**

The website at www.mediauk.net is governed by these privacy policies. All other services accessed through these pages have their own privacy policies which are linked clearly from all pages. 

**Agreement**

By using this site, you signify your assent to this policy, and also to our copyright restrictions. If you do not agree, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
