# Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

MediaMath is the leading online media trading company, offering agencies and their advertisers unprecedented reach and performance through one relationship. The company's industry-leading TerminalOne® platform is an enterprise-class DSP providing an unmatched combination of supply, data, analytics, workflow automation and optimization to return focus to marketing strategy rather than media execution. MediaMath is headquartered in New York City with offices in Los Angeles, Chicago,  
Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and London.

This Privacy Statement presents MediaMath’s privacy policy, including privacy practices for our data use and collection across our platform and the [www.MediaMath.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20111231212643id_/) web site.

MediaMath is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Accordingly, we strictly adhere to all industry guidelines, and will continue to review and improve our privacy policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of consumer information.

MediaMath’s technology complies with the rules of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project, as outlined by the World Wide Web Consortium. P3P provides a simple, automated way for users to gain more control over the use of their personal information.

MediaMath is an active member of the industry associations that govern the use and policies around online consumer privacy including the IAB, IAB UK, the Digital Advertising Alliance (‘DAA’) and the Network Advertising Initiative (‘NAI’) ([www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)).  MediaMath complies with the Industry’s Self-Regulatory Principles and we believe that these Principles will protect and ensure individual consumer privacy.

MediaMath uses a DAA-Approved platform to comply with the ‘Enhanced Notice’ standard as dictated by the cross-industry Self-Regulation Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  As part of this service, advertisements served by MediaMath’s platform are sometimes delivered with icons that serve as a signal to consumers that behavioral data has been used.  Through the icon, consumers can learn how their information is being used and by what companies, and access tools to control the collection and use of their information.

####  **MediaMath Data Collection On Behalf of Our Clients**

In the course of delivering an ad to you, MediaMath does not collect personally identifiable information about you.  Personally identifiable information includes data such as your name, address, phone number, social security number or email address. MediaMath does collect non-personally identifiable information about you, for the use of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of MediaMath's advertisers. This non-personally identifiable information includes data like:

Domain Type |  .com, .net, .edu, etc.  
---|---  
Standard Data |  Common information found in every communication sent over the Internet. Using this information, MediaMath can infer information such as: browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g., Macintosh or Windows); browser language (e.g., Java or Unix); Internet service provider (e.g., MindSpring or AOL).  
Clickstream Data |  MediaMath can infer how you use our client sites and pages on the Internet  
  
MediaMath uses this non-personally to create data segments, and these data segments are generally based upon the websites that you visit. MediaMath also obtains information from 3rd party data providers who collect and make available information such as behavioral, contextual, and demographic data. For example, if you visit a number of travel websites, you may be flagged as being interested in taking a vacation.

MediaMath does not collect data or create data segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information such as detailed financial information and sensitive medical conditions. We don’t use any data segments to determine credit worthiness, for insurance underwriting or similar purposes.  At MediaMath, we think its important to provide this transparency to help you have a better idea of which segments might be collected by us, so you can make informed decisions.  

**About Cookies**

Like most Internet sites, MediaMath uses "cookies" to enhance user's experience on the Web. MediaMath cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files.

_What are cookies and how do they enhance your Web experience?_

A MediaMath cookie is a unique number that is assigned to you the first time MediaMath serves you an ad or identifies you on a client’s website. This number is stored in a file on your computer and helps us deliver the optimal ad to you. For instance, cookies help MediaMath ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same advertisement. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site and the effectiveness of an advertisement. This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to your needs and deliver to you the types of ads in which you are more interested.

Although MediaMath believes that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web by delivering more relevant messages to you, MediaMath does not need cookies to deliver ads to you. If you decline a MediaMath cookie, you will still be able to view ads; however, you may see the same ad repeatedly or be delivered ads that have no relevance to you.

**How long is data stored?**

MediaMath sets our cookies to expire after three years and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server.  MediaMath retains the web log data for ninety days and aggregations and reports for up to three years.

**To Opt Out**

If do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny this feature. In order to “opt out” of the benefits of targeted advertising, you may click here: MediaMath Opt-out. You may opt out of other online advertising companies that are members of the NAI here: [NAI Global Optout](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or the DAA's site, [http://aboutads.info](http://aboutads.info/).

Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

If you have opted out and wish to opt back in you may use the cookie settings in your browser to clear the MediaMath optout cookie. If you have questions, please contact us at [privacy@mediamath.com](mailto:%20privacy@nullmediamath.com).
