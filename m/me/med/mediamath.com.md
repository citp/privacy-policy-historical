# Privacy Policy – MediaMath

## **Privacy Policy**

_Effective as of December 1, 2015_

### **Introduction**

MediaMath is a global provider of digital media and data management technology for advertisers and agencies. MediaMath’s TerminalOne™ Marketing Operating System (the “Platform”) activates data, automates execution, and optimizes advertising interactions across addressable media—delivering greater performance, transparency, and control to marketers and a better experience to consumers.

This Privacy Statement presents MediaMath’s privacy policy, including privacy practices for data choice, use and collection via our Platform and on the [www.mediamath.com](https://www.mediamath.com/) website (the “Website”).

### **The MediaMath Platform**

MediaMath is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Accordingly, we adhere to applicable industry guidelines, and will continue to review and update our privacy policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of consumer information.

MediaMath complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. MediaMath has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

MediaMath is an active member of the industry associations that govern the policies around online consumer privacy, including: the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Italy, Mexico, Singapore, the US and the UK; the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) in the US, EU, and Canada; and the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) ([www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)). MediaMath complies with the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and their Application to the Mobile Environment, and the 2015 NAI Code of Conduct. We believe that these programs’ principles help protect and ensure individual consumer privacy.

#### **Platform Data Collection and Use**

At MediaMath, we think it’s important to provide transparency so that you have a better idea of which data we might collect and can make informed decisions.

In the course of delivering an ad to you via the Platform, MediaMath does not collect data such as your name, address, phone number, or social security number. MediaMath collects data about your computer or device that is considered non-personally identifiable and pseudonymous in most jurisdictions in which we operate. In certain contexts and jurisdictions, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other pseudonymous information may be considered personal data.

MediaMath uses this information to target ads and measure the effectiveness of ads on behalf of MediaMath’s advertisers. This information includes common information found in every communication sent over the Internet, from which we can often infer such things as:

  * Browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer)
  * Operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows)
  * Browser language (e.g., English or Spanish)
  * Internet Protocol (IP) address
  * Internet Service Provider (e.g., Comcast or Verizon)
  * Mobile advertising identifier, for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets



MediaMath may also collect data regarding your interactions with our clients and partners, including your use of our clients’ sites and mobile apps, the sites and apps our clients advertise on, and other pages on the Internet. We may also capture additional data in order to calculate a statistical ID, as described below.

MediaMath may use this non-personally identifiable and pseudonymous data to create data segments, and these data segments are generally based upon your interactions with our clients such as the websites that you visit and the mobile applications that you use. MediaMath also receives information from third-party data providers that create non-personally identifiable behavioral, contextual, and demographic segments for our clients to use in targeting ads through the Platform. In some cases, MediaMath is able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer and mobile device should be associated with the same unique MediaMath ID. Where we are able to make such inferences, we may deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices.

MediaMath does not collect data or create data segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we don’t use any data segments to determine credit worthiness, for insurance underwriting or similar purposes). Clients may use health-related segments (which are not comprised of sensitive health data) such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or cough medicine and allergy medications. ([Click here](https://www.mediamath.com/files/pdf/Health_related_Segments_provided_by_3rd_party_Data_Providers.pdf) for a list of the standard health-related segments provided by third-party data providers that may be used in MediaMath’s Platform.)

#### **Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Ad Targeting Technologies**

Like most digital marketing platforms, MediaMath uses “cookies”, mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to enhance users’ experiences on the web, to deliver more relevant ads, and for ad delivery and reporting via the Platform.

MediaMath cannot use these technologies to personally identify you. We use these technologies to help recognize a unique computer or device so that MediaMath and our clients are able to deliver relevant advertising, measure the impact of that advertising and better understand and recognize digital media usage patterns. Your browser, computer, or mobile device is assigned a unique MediaMath ID the first time MediaMath serves an ad to it or identifies it on a client’s website. This unique ID may be stored in a file on your computer or mobile device. Along with the other information we collect via the Platform as described above, this unique ID helps us deliver more relevant ads to you. The ID and other information collected via the Platform can also help our advertising clients measure your activity on their sites and determine the effectiveness of advertisements delivered via the Platform. This information can then be used by our advertising clients to better cater to your needs and deliver to you ads for the types of products in which you might be interested. None of these technologies enable us to personally identify an individual. Instead, they enable the Platform to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that the computer or device we served an ad to on Monday may be the same computer or device on which we observed a purchase on Tuesday.

The types of technologies used via the Platform include:

  * **Cookies** – Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters. MediaMath uses cookies to uniquely identify an Internet browser. Certain browsers or browser settings sometimes block cookies, and cookies may not work effectively on some mobile devices. For more information about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.
  * **Mobile Advertising Identifiers** – Mobile advertising IDs are unique, non-PII IDs associated with individual mobile devices. They usually are user-resettable.
  * **Pixel Tags** – Pixel tags (also commonly known as web beacons) are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript that our clients and partners use to understand how consumers interact with them online, including on websites and in mobile apps.
  * **Statistical IDs** – Statistical IDs are created via an algorithm using non-personally identifiable and pseudonymous information about your computer or device, including your operating system, user-agent string, IP address (in jurisdictions where this is not considered to be personal data), Internet browser, installed fonts, and similar information. This information makes your computer or device distinct enough for our systems to determine within a reasonable probability that they are encountering the same computer or device, including in environments where MediaMath cookies are not supported.



None of these technologies, whether individually or as a whole, are used via the Platform to identify individual people. Rather, they are used to uniquely identify a computer or device within a certain level of confidence that enables the Platform to function and serve more relevant ads.

**Data Retention – How Long is Data Stored on the Platform?**

Cookies set via the Platform expire after 13 months or less. After 13 months, we expire the unique ID and targeting segments that are associated with your browser, computer, or device. MediaMath retains log-level data in the Platform for up to 13 months and maintains aggregate data (which cannot be associated to any individual device) for up to three years.

#### **Consumer Opt-Out**

**Two Reasons You May Not Want to Opt Out**

Advertising supports the free Internet. It is the primary way that most website and app publishers make money in order to produce the content consumers want. Not all advertising shown to consumers is relevant to their interests, though. Interest-based advertising is advertising that tries to make the ads you see more interesting and relevant to you based on the types of sites you visit online and other non-personally identifiable information. We conduct interest-based advertising on this website.

Without interested-based advertising, you will still see ads, but those ads are not likely to have anything to do with products or services you care about. With interest-based advertising, you receive ads and offers that are more likely to be useful to you.

There is also a second benefit to you: companies that create websites and apps rely on the revenue from interest-based advertising to support the rich array of content they produce. Without that revenue, the content would either be unavailable or consumers would have to pay for it.

Interest-based advertising does **not** depend on information that is personally identifiable to you, such as your name, address, phone number, etc.

#### **To Opt Out**

**What does it mean to opt-out?**  
In general, “opting out” means that you don’t want MediaMath to deliver ads that are targeted to your interests on your computer or device. If you use multiple browsers, computers or mobile devices, you must opt out of each individually. Please note that if cookies are not enabled in your browser, or if you use certain ad-blocking tools, our opt-out mechanism may not work properly. Please also note that deleting your cookies does not equate to opting out.

_Web-Based Opt-Out Mechanism_ :  
Your current interest-based advertising status with MediaMath is:

_Mobile App-Based Opt-Out Mechanism_ :  
You may also opt out using the “AppChoices” mobile application, which you can download to your mobile device from your App Store or via the Digital Advertising Alliance App Choices page [here](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices).

**_Please note that you will still see ads if you opt out._** The ads delivered via MediaMath will just not be as relevant to you.

When you opt out, we record the opt-out on our servers and in browser environments will attempt to place an HTTP opt-out cookie onto your computer or device. When you opt out, MediaMath also stops serving interest-based advertising on that browser or device. In many instances, even if you delete your cookies, we are able to maintain a record of your opt-out on our servers. **_Nonetheless, please note that if you clear your cookies, or if you use a different browser or device, you may need to renew your opt-out choice._**

**Disclosure**  
MediaMath reserves the right to publish or otherwise make public anonymous, aggregate, or summary information regarding users and campaigns run on behalf of our clients. We may share user-level data with clients. There also may be instances when we disclose information in our systems in order to: protect the legal rights of MediaMath or its employees, agents and contractors; protect the safety and security of users and visitors to our Website; protect against fraud; or to comply with the law or legal process. If MediaMath sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer information in our systems to a third party as part of that transaction.

**Technologies Used on the Website**  
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by MediaMath and our partners (such as service providers), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (e.g., video providers and email service providers to send email on our behalf). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Website, tracking a visitor’s movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our Website visitors as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. Additionally, some of our third party service providers, with whom we partner use Flash cookies to collect and store information to better provide you with video content. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include IP address, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

The Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button, and Widgets such as the ShareThis button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.

**Consumer Choice and Access**  
MediaMath will allow an individual access to their personal information to the extent it is available and allow the individual to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
