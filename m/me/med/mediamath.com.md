Privacy Policy

Effective as of June 16, 2014

**Introduction**

MediaMath is a global provider of digital media and data management technology for advertisers and agencies. MediaMath’s TerminalOne™ platform activates data, automates execution, and optimizes advertising interactions across addressable media—delivering greater performance, transparency, and control to marketers and a better experience to consumers. MediaMath is headquartered in New York City with offices in Boston, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, Sao Paolo, Singapore, and Tokyo.

This Privacy Statement presents MediaMath’s privacy policy, including privacy practices for data use and collection by our platform and on the [www.mediamath.com](http://www.mediamath.com/) website.

MediaMath is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of internet users. Accordingly, we adhere to applicable industry guidelines, and will continue to review and improve our privacy policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of consumer information.

MediaMath complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. MediaMath has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

MediaMath's technology complies with the rules of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project, as outlined by the World Wide Web Consortium. P3P provides a simple, automated way for users to gain more control over the use of their personal information.

MediaMath is an active member of the industry associations that govern the use and policies around online consumer privacy including the IAB, IAB UK, the Digital Advertising Alliance (‘DAA’) in the US, EU and Canada and the Network Advertising Initiative (‘NAI’) ([www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)).  MediaMath complies with the aforementioned Self-Regulatory Principles and we believe that these Principles help protect and ensure individual consumer privacy.

MediaMath uses a DAA-Approved platform to comply with the ‘Enhanced Notice’ standard as dictated by the cross-industry Self-Regulation Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. As part of this service, advertisements served by MediaMath’s platform are sometimes delivered with icons that serve as a signal to consumers that behavioral data has been used. Through the icon, consumers can learn how their information is being used and by what companies, and access tools to control the collection and use of their information.

#### **MediaMath Data Collection On Behalf of Our Clients**

In the course of delivering an ad to you, MediaMath does not collect personally identifiable information about you. Personally identifiable information includes data such as your name, address, phone number, social security number, or email address. MediaMath does collect non-personally identifiable information about you, for the use of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of MediaMath’s advertisers. This non-personally identifiable information includes data like:

Domain Type | .com, .net, .edu, etc.  
---|---  
Standard Data | Common information found in every communication sent over the internet. Using this information, MediaMath can infer information such as: browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows); browser language (e.g., Java or Unix); internet service provider (e.g., Comcast or Verizon).  
Clickstream Data | MediaMath can infer how you use our clients’ sites and pages on the Internet.  
  
MediaMath may use this non-personally identifiable data to create data segments, and these data segments are generally based upon the websites that you visit. MediaMath also receives information from 3rd party data providers who collect and make available information such as behavioral, contextual, and demographic data, for our clients to use in targeting ads through our platform. For example, our clients may use health-related segments such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or cough medicine and allergy medications. ([ **Click here**](https://web.archive.org/files/pdf/Health_related_Segments_provided_by_3rd_party_Data_Providers.pdf) **  for a complete list of Health-related segments provided by 3rd party data providers, that may be used in MediaMath’s platform.**) 

MediaMath does not collect data or create data segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we don’t use any data segments to determine credit worthiness, for insurance underwriting or similar purposes). At MediaMath, we think it’s important to provide transparency to help you have a better idea of which segments might be collected by us, so you can make informed decisions. 

**About Cookies**

Like most digital marketing platforms, MediaMath uses "cookies" to enhance users’ experiences on the web, to deliver more relevant ads and for ad delivery and reporting. MediaMath cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files.

_What are cookies and how do they enhance your Web experience?_

A MediaMath cookie is a unique number that is assigned to your browser the first time MediaMath serves your browser an ad or identifies your browser on a client’s website. This number is stored in a file on your computer and helps us deliver relevant ads to you. For instance, cookies help MediaMath ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same advertisement. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site and the effectiveness of an advertisement. This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to your needs and deliver to you ads for the types products in which you might be interested.

Although MediaMath believes that cookies help enhance your experience on the web by delivering more relevant messages to you, MediaMath does not need cookies to deliver ads to you. If you decline a MediaMath cookie, you will still be able to view ads; however, you may see the same ad repeatedly or be delivered ads that have no relevance to you.

**Data Retention - How long is data stored?**

MediaMath sets our cookies to expire after three years and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server.  MediaMath retains the web log data for ninety (90) days and aggregations and reports for up to three years.

**Information Pertaining to Children**

MediaMath’s products and services are designed for those 13 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If the company is made aware that it has received personally identifiable information from someone under 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.

If you do not want the benefits of targeted advertising, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny this feature. In order to “opt out” of the benefits of targeted advertising, you may click here: MediaMath Opt-out.

Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

**About clear gifs**

Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help web publishers understand how visitors interact with their web sites. A clear gif is a transparent graphic image that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows a web site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. MediaMath may utilize clear gifs to measure visitor behavior, to help us improve visitor experience, and to manage website content.

**Disclosure**

MediaMath may publish or otherwise make public anonymous, aggregate, or summary information regarding site visitors and campaigns run on behalf of our clients. MediaMath may share visitor level data with a client, restricted to include only data associated with the client’s campaigns. MediaMath will never share visitor data with any third parties. There also may be instances when we may disclose visitor information in order to: protect the legal rights of Media Math or its employees, agents and contractors; protect the safety and security of visitors to our site; protect against fraud; or to comply with the law or legal process. If Media Math sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer visitor information to a third party as part of that transaction.

**MediaMath Data Collection for our Corporate Site**

MediaMath does not collect or ask visitors to reveal any personal information on our corporate website. MediaMath uses non-personally identifiable information from our website log files to determine how you found out about us, what your interests are regarding our services, and how to further improve our site and our service towards you.

**Consumer Choice and Access**

MediaMath will allow an individual access to their Personal Information to the extent it is available and allow the individual to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. If you'd like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any other Personal Information that you have provided to us, please send your request to us at [privacy@mediamath.com](mailto:privacy@mediamath.com) and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.

**Security and Data Integrity**

MediaMath uses commercially reasonable measures to safeguard data in our possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. No transmission of data over the internet, however, is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of MediaMath to intercept or access transmissions or communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. MediaMath processes information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

**Policy Revisions**

From time to time Media Math may revise this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change affect whether or how we we collect or use personally identifiable information those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.

This privacy statement applies solely to the technology and website of MediaMath. MediaMath’s website contains links to other sites, and the ads delivered by our platform may run on a variety of other sites. Please be aware that MediaMath is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

**Enforcement, Questions and Complaints**

_Enforcement:_

To address any issues regarding our compliance with the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles, MediaMath, along with the NAI and other NAI members have created a compliance program that incorporates attestation reviews, a consumer complaint process, sanctions, and annual reporting to help ensure that member companies keep their promises to you and abide by the NAI's Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct. Please refer to the [NAI site](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) for more information.
