                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">Ad Server:</b> An ad server, in its simplest form, is responsible for delivering an ad to be shown in a web page or a mobile app. Today, communications may be sent to several servers in the process of selecting and delivering an ad. This occurs in a matter of milliseconds.</p>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">Beacons, Pixels, and Tags:</b> Beacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, on web sites by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page. A tag is a small piece of website code that is run by the web browser.</p>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">Mobile SDK:</b> A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a beacon or tag (see Beacons and Tags above). The SDK is a piece of computer code that publishers include in their apps to enable ads to be shown and to enable related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention.</p>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">Cookie: </b> A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another. (See the Privacy Statement below and our Platform Cookie Policy for more information on how Media White  uses cookies.)</p>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">Non-Cookie Technology: </b>Today’s online world is becoming increasingly complex, with a proliferation of new devices, software platforms, online services, and other technology. In this world, cookies are not always available. Therefore, companies are using alternative methods to distinguish devices. For example, some platforms, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising. Most mobile devices are assigned unique identifiers that also may be used to distinguish devices. Additionally, it is possible to use mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses about recognizing devices.</p>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">ID Synching: </b>ID synching (sometimes also referred to as cookie syncing), though not often discussed, is a common and long-standing process in the industry. It enables advertisers to use data on multiple advertising platforms. Here’s an example of how it works. Let’s say you sell a product on your website, and a customer visits your site. You store a cookie to identify that customer’s browser with an ID of 12345 and associate that ID with information about what the customer shopped for on your site. If you want to use that information to advertise on other sites, you might buy the advertising through an online advertising marketplace. In order to buy the right ads, you’ll need to match ID 12345 to the ID the marketplace has assigned to the same customer (which let’s say for this example is ABCDE), you’ll have a record that says ID 12345 = Marketplace ID ABCDE. That way, when the marketplace offers to sell you an ad to be shown to ABCDE, your system will know that ABCDE is the same as 12345, and you can pick the right ad to show the customer.</p>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">Interest-Based Advertising: </b>Interest-based advertising uses information collected across multiple web sites or mobile apps to predict users' preferences and to show ads that are most likely to be of interest to them. For example, if a user visits a travel site or uses a travel app, she might see travel-related ads on another site or app. Advertisers may also use other information they have or acquire about users’ interests. Users have choices with respect to this type of advertising, as discussed below.</p>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">Precise Geographic Location: </b>Your device, typically a mobile device, may be capable of sharing your precise geographic location with apps or web pages that you visit using that device. Devices use one or more methods to determine this location, including GPS coordinates and information about wifi networks in your vicinity. (Geographic location determined from IP address is typically not considered to be “precise.”) Devices such as iPhone or Android phones should require users’ consent before installing or using an app that accesses the device’s precise geographic location. The app, in turn, may make this information available to third party advertising companies in order to make the ads you see more relevant.</p>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important"><b style="font-weight:bold; color:#565656;">Real-Time Transactions (Also called Real-Time Bidding or Programmatic Advertising): </b>Advertising buyers are able to bid in “real time" for the opportunity to show an online advertisement when a web page is loaded or an app is used. The winning bidder gets to show its ad.<br>
                        Of course, the explanations above are simplified. There are many resources available on the web to learn more about these concepts and online advertising in general. </p>

                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important">Media White has created a technology platform (Platform or Media White Platform) that our clients use to buy, sell, and deliver online advertising, including interest-based advertising, mostly through real-time bidding. In other words, the Media White Platform does not itself buy, sell, or deliver ads, but provides technology that other companies use for those purposes.<br>
                        The Media White Platform is designed to enable other companies (our clients) to buy, sell, or deliver advertising using “Platform Data” that clients may collect using the Platform, derive from their use of the Platform, or acquire from other sources and then use on the Platform. The Privacy Statement below describes how Media White handles Platform Data that is collected or used on the Platform by and on behalf of our clients.</p>

                    <div id="textAA">
                      <h4>Platform Data</h4>
                      <p style="padding-bottom:1px !important">For simplicity, accuracy, and clarity in discussing our privacy practices, we refer to the data collected and used on the Platform as “Platform Data.” Platform Data includes data elements such as information received from the web browser, operating system, or device, including such things as information about the browser type and browser settings, information about the operating system or device, the web address of a web page visited, the name or type of mobile app, the address of the referring web page, the IP address of the device, cookie information, and other information about a web page or app. Collectively, this data might be called HTTP header data or clickstream data. Platform Data also includes information about the geographic location of the device. It may also include inferences or information about users’ interests that are created, acquired, or used by our clients. Platform Data does not include, and Media White does not collect, use, or allow on the Platform, data that, by itself, directly identifies an individual, such as name, address, phone number, email address, or government identifier. </p>
