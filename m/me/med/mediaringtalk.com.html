In order to provide service to you, MediaRing collects your name, email address, gender, country and date of birth, among other information. If you choose not to register or provide such personal information, you can still visit most of MediaRing's web site. However, you will not be able to initiate our services.<br> 
                            <br> <br> 
                            <u>Demographic Information</u>. MediaRing collects demographic information from you, including but not limited to gender and your date of birth. This information helps us tailor messages and services to your interests.<br> <br>
                            The registration information and certain demographic information is personally identifiable information ("PII"). We never sell or rent PII to third parties. We do not disclose your PII to third persons, except (1) your IP address always accompanies your chat or telephone call, (2) as required by law, valid subpoena, or to comply with law or enforce a legal right, (3) if you expressly authorize us to disclose your PII, such as when you make a call for emergency services or (4) under strict obligations of confidentiality and limitations on use, as when MediaRing uses a third party to accomplish a task on MediaRing’s behalf (e.g. MediaRing uses a third-party intermediary for authorization and authentication of credit card transactions, and may send you an email by using a third party whose line of business is transmitting emails; no third party is allowed to provide your PII to anyone else or use your PII for any other purpose).<br> 
                            <br>
                            We use PII to provide you with (1) information about MediaRing products, services, and updates, and (2) other information that may be of interest to you. We provide such information to you by email or through digital advertisements on the MediaRing Talk dialer. If you would like to stop receiving any or all of this information, you may do so at any time by giving us an email to  
                            <a href="mailto:cs@mediaringtalk.com"><strong><u>cs@mediaringtalk.com</u></strong></a>. 
                            However, you cannot opt out of emails that involve information on your account status or MediaRing Talk® service-related matters.<br> <br> <u><br>
                            Credit Card Information</u>. If you purchase a MediaRing prepaid account and pay using a credit card, we collect your credit card information, which is used for processing payments only and not for any other purpose. We send all credit card transaction information to a third-party intermediary for authorization and authentication, and of course send charge information to your credit card issuer.<br> 
                            <br> <br> <u>Third Party Information</u>. If you originate a telephone call or send an email message to a third party, you give us the third party's contact information, such as telephone number or email address. We complete the call but do not retain that person's information to contact them later to solicit them to join our service or for other purposes. MediaRing has a program (“Tell-a-Friend”) where we solicit the names and addresses of people who may be interested in our services. We use the information received under that program to send – at your request -- a potential user an email invitation to join our service.<br> <br> <u><br>
                            Phone Conversations</u>. MediaRing does not record, listen to, or disclose your conversations when using the services offered hereunder, unless required to do so by valid court order or as otherwise required by law. MediaRing does maintain a log of your calls – see “Customer Proprietary Network Information” below.<br> <br> <br> 
                            <u>Text Chat Records</u>. MediaRing Talk offers each person who signs up for the services the capability of keeping a text record of his or her text chat session. You can configure your computer to “save” your text chat session by following the instructions in the FAQ guide on <a href="http://www.mediaringtalk.com/"><strong><u>www.mediaringtalk.com</u></strong></a>. Likewise, the person you are text chatting with can also elect to keep a record of the session. However, one person in a text chat session cannot ascertain whether the other person in the session is keeping a record of the text chat session. MediaRing does not keep a record of the content of your chat session, unless otherwise required to do so by valid court order or as otherwise required by law, but MediaRing’s records do show whether a chat session took place.<br>

                            We also collect information on use of our services. While you are making a call or having a chat session, we track the duration of the call and of the chat session and keep records of that. We also keep information on where a call originates and where it terminates. We do this for billing purposes and for recordkeeping as required by law and for our internal planning requirements.<br> <br>
                            We use aggregate information to understand our business better so we can upgrade our infrastructure in accordance with user needs.

Some of the information helps create a profile of an individual user, while other information helps create a profile of our users in aggregate. We may provide this profile information to advertisers, but not as PII, and only in aggregate terms. For example, we may inform advertisers that we have a certain number of registered users who have an interest in a topic and are interested in receiving information about the topic. This helps to tailor information from advertisers to your interests.<br> <br> <br> </td>

You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use SSL or might not have sufficient encryption capability.

                              <li>Choose a password you can remember but others will not guess. Change it regularly, and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure. If your laptop is lost or stolen, you should log-on to the service and change your password and security question.</li>
                              <li>When you have finished a session on our web site, make sure that you prevent your details being seen by anyone that you do not wish to see them. So, if you have registered and logged in, remember to log off. Clear any “cache” so there is no record of any transactions left on screen – both Netscape and Internet Explorer let you do this. We recommend you then close your browser so any history of the session is cleared. As an extra precaution, when you log-on to our website, your session on the website will terminate if you have not used the site for 10 minutes. </li>
