If you purchase a MediaRing premium service and pay using a credit card, we collect your credit card information, which is used for processing payments only and not for any other purpose.

MediaRing does not record, listen to, or disclose your conversations or communications when using the services offered hereunder, unless required to do so by valid court order or as otherwise required by law. MediaRing does maintain a log of your calls and SMS messages – see “Customer Proprietary Network Information” below.<br><br><strong>Text Chat Records</strong>. MediaRing Talk offers each person who signs up for the services the capability of keeping a text record of his or her text chat session. You can configure your computer to "save" your text chat session by following the instructions in the FAQ guide on  <span class="contentLinkBold"><a href="http://www.mediaringtalk.com"><strong>www.mediaringtalk.com</strong></a></span>. Likewise, the person you are text chatting with can also elect to keep a record of the session. However, one person in a text chat session cannot ascertain whether the other person in the session is keeping a record of the text chat session. MediaRing does not keep a record of the content of your chat session, unless otherwise required to do so by valid court order or as otherwise required by law, but MediaRing’s records do show whether a chat session took place.<br><br>When you send a SMS message or if someone replies to your SMS message, a copy of the message is never stored on our servers. A transaction record will be saved for billing purposes. Copy of sent message and received messages will be stored on your computer and the same applies to the recipient (computer/mobile phone). Incoming and outgoing messages may stay on our servers during the transit time (waiting to be delivered)</div></td>

                              <td class="Account_Page_Table_Content"><div align="justify">When you register for our services, purchase our services, or access account details, we use a secure server. Any data you give us is encrypted using a ”Secure Socket Layer” (SSL) connection. SSL is an industry standard and is one of the best ways to ensure Internet messages are not intercepted. You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use SSL or might not have sufficient encryption capability. To be sure, you will need Netscape version 6.1 or Internet Explorer browsers version 5.0 or above.<br>
MediaRing will take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal information and the data exchanged on the Talk client application with due observance of applicable law.<br>
Over and above what we do to safeguard your privacy and security, there are a number of things you can do to protect yourself from Internet fraud:
Choose a password you can remember but others will not guess. Change it regularly, and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure. If your laptop or computer or mobile phone handset is lost or stolen, you should log-on to the service and change your password and security question.<br>
When you have finished a session on our web site, make sure that you prevent your details being seen by anyone that you do not wish to see them. So, if you have registered and logged in, remember to log off. Clear any ”cache” so there is no record of any transactions left on screen – both Netscape and Internet Explorer let you do this. We recommend you then close your browser so any history of the session is cleared. As an extra precaution, when you log-on to our website, your session on the website will terminate if you have not used the site for 10 minutes.  Likewise, when using the MediaRing Talk client application on your computer or handset, remember to close the client application if you go away from your computer or handset, lest any person in the vicinity uses your account or exhausts your account balance without your permission.
