| MediaRing® Ltd, organized under the Laws of the Republic of Singapore, and its affiliates, including but not limited to MediaRing.com, Inc. a corporation organized under the Laws of California, USA (hereinafter referred to as "MediaRing") acknowledge the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information provided by our users. This Privacy Policy describes our information collection and use practices and the privacy of information we receive from you. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the web site so that you may be aware of the change. Your continued use of our services will signify your consent to our use of your information. If you do not agree, you can contact us to discuss the policy, stop use of the website and/or services, or deregister. 

MediaRing does not target services to individuals less than age 13. Individuals less than 13 years of age are not eligible to register or initiate our services. Please register after you have reached age 13.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED**  
**1\. Personally Identifiable Information.**  
_Registration Information_. In order to provide service to you, MediaRing collects your name, email address, gender, country and date of birth, among other information. If you choose not to register or provide such personal information, you can still visit most of MediaRing's web site. However, you will not be able to initiate our services. _Demographic Information_. MediaRing collects demographic information from you, including but not limited to gender and your date of birth. This information helps us tailor messages and services to your interests.

The registration information and certain demographic information is personally identifiable information ("PII"). We never sell or rent PII to third parties. We do not disclose your PII to third persons, except (1) your IP address always accompanies your chat or telephone call, (2) as required by law, valid subpoena, or to comply with law or enforce a legal right, (3) if you expressly authorize us to disclose your PII, such as when you make a call for emergency services or (4) under strict obligations of confidentiality and limitations on use, as when MediaRing uses a third party to accomplish a task on MediaRing’s behalf (e.g. MediaRing uses a third-party intermediary for authorization and authentication of credit card transactions, and may send you an email by using a third party whose line of business is transmitting emails; no third party is allowed to provide your PII to anyone else or use your PII for any other purpose).

We use PII to provide you with (1) information about MediaRing products, services, and updates, and (2) other information that may be of interest to you. We provide such information to you by email or through digital advertisements on the MediaRing Talk dialer. If you would like to stop receiving any or all of this information, you may do so at any time by giving us an email to [**_cs@mediaringtalk.com_**](mailto:cs@mediaringtalk.com). However, you cannot opt out of emails that involve information on your account status or MediaRing Talk® service-related matters.

 _  
Credit Card Information_. If you purchase a MediaRing prepaid account and pay using a credit card, we collect your credit card information, which is used for processing payments only and not for any other purpose. We send all credit card transaction information to a third-party intermediary for authorization and authentication, and of course send charge information to your credit card issuer. _Third Party Information_. If you originate a telephone call or send an email message to a third party, you give us the third party's contact information, such as telephone number or email address. We complete the call but do not retain that person's information to contact them later to solicit them to join our service or for other purposes. MediaRing has a program (“Tell-a-Friend”) where we solicit the names and addresses of people who may be interested in our services. We use the information received under that program to send – at your request -- a potential user an email invitation to join our service. _  
Phone Conversations_. MediaRing does not record, listen to, or disclose your conversations when using the services offered hereunder, unless required to do so by valid court order or as otherwise required by law. MediaRing does maintain a log of your calls – see “Customer Proprietary Network Information” below. _Text Chat Records_. MediaRing Talk offers each person who signs up for the services the capability of keeping a text record of his or her text chat session. You can configure your computer to “save” your text chat session by following the instructions in the FAQ guide on [**_www.mediaringtalk.com_**](http://www.mediaringtalk.com/). Likewise, the person you are text chatting with can also elect to keep a record of the session. However, one person in a text chat session cannot ascertain whether the other person in the session is keeping a record of the text chat session. MediaRing does not keep a record of the content of your chat session, unless otherwise required to do so by valid court order or as otherwise required by law, but MediaRing’s records do show whether a chat session took place.  
**2\. Aggregate Information**  
MediaRing collects aggregate information about use of our web site, using surveys, cookies, and data-mining technologies. We track such information as the number of visitors, duration of visits, how our site is navigated, and the kinds of browsers that visit our site. Information on general web site usage is aggregate information rather than PII.

We also collect information on use of our services. While you are making a call or having a chat session, we track the duration of the call and of the chat session and keep records of that. We also keep information on where a call originates and where it terminates. We do this for billing purposes and for recordkeeping as required by law and for our internal planning requirements.

We use aggregate information to understand our business better so we can upgrade our infrastructure in accordance with user needs. We may disclose aggregate information to third parties, but a recipient of aggregate information will not be able to trace it back to any individual user or a user’s PII.  
  
**3\. Profiles**  
One of the ways we pay for the services we provide is by serving advertisements while you use our services. We use all of the information available to us to create profiles of our user base. Some of the information helps create a profile of an individual user, while other information helps create a profile of our users in aggregate. We may provide this profile information to advertisers, but not as PII, and only in aggregate terms. For example, we may inform advertisers that we have a certain number of registered users who have an interest in a topic and are interested in receiving information about the topic. This helps to tailor information from advertisers to your interests.  
**4\. Customer Proprietary Network Information ("CPNI")**  
MediaRing maintains a record of your sign-ins to the MediaRing Talk service and of calls each subscriber has made, including call origination number, call termination number, duration and time of call, and account balance, among other information, such as a log of text chat sessions. MediaRing does not disclose such CPNI of a subscriber to third parties except (a) as otherwise required by law or to enforce its rights, or (b) to accomplish a task on MediaRing’s behalf, in which case disclosure is subject to strict obligations of confidentiality.  
**WHO COLLECTS INFORMATION?**  
MediaRing collects registration information and demographic information from you, as described above. MediaRing also collects aggregate information and CPNI. MediaRing holds information collected from you in servers and other computer systems owned and operated by MediaRing and/or its subsidiaries in the United States and Singapore and various other locations. By registering, you consent to MediaRing’s transfer of your PII and aggregate information from your country to such locations. _Cookies_. Our web site sets "cookies" to help deliver content specific to your interests, to customize our web site for you, and to save your password and member name so that you don't have to enter it each time you visit. Cookies are text files that are stored on your personal computer (“PC”) and that allow web sites to identify you. Cookies help us target advertising and other information to your interests and prevent duplication of ads served to your browser. If you do not want cookies to be stored on your PC, web browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer provide the option to disable them. Please bear in mind that some personalized services on our web site may be impacted if you choose to disable cookies.  
**PROTECTION OF YOUR DETAILS**  
  
When you register for our services, purchase our services, or access account details, we use a secure server. Any data you give us is encrypted using a “Secure Socket Layer” (SSL) connection. SSL is an industry standard and is one of the best ways to ensure Internet messages are not intercepted. You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use SSL or might not have sufficient encryption capability. To be sure, you will need Netscape version 6.1 or Internet Explorer browsers version 5.0 or above.

Over and above what we do to safeguard your privacy and security, there are a number of things you can do to protect yourself from Internet fraud:

  1. Choose a password you can remember but others will not guess. Change it regularly, and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure. If your laptop is lost or stolen, you should log-on to the service and change your password and security question.
  2. When you have finished a session on our web site, make sure that you prevent your details being seen by anyone that you do not wish to see them. So, if you have registered and logged in, remember to log off. Clear any “cache” so there is no record of any transactions left on screen – both Netscape and Internet Explorer let you do this. We recommend you then close your browser so any history of the session is cleared. As an extra precaution, when you log-on to our website, your session on the website will terminate if you have not used the site for 10 minutes. 

  
**UPDATING YOUR DETAILS**  
If you want to change any of the information that you have provided to us, such as your email address or name, you may log-in on [www.mediaringtalk.com](http://www.mediaringtalk.com/) at the account sign-in and update your user profile.  
**SECURITY OF THE INTERNET **  
_Public Forums_. Our site may contain, from time to time, public forums available to users. Please remember that any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information. You should take appropriate measures to protect your personally identifiable information. _Co-Branded Sites_. We sometimes enter arrangements with third parties whereby we make available our services through their web sites with a co-branded page that we host and serve. In some such cases, users may register for our service as well as that of the co-branded party. We use your PII and other general information in compliance with our Privacy Policy. Our co-branding partners have their own privacy policy, which you should review since we do not have control over their privacy policies. _Links to Other Web Sites_. Our website and client application may contain, from time to time, links to other web sites by virtue of ads being served. Please note that MediaRing is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites or of any third party. You should review the privacy policies of such web sites when you visit them. _General_. The Internet is not a secure medium, so be aware that communications over it are subject to third-party interception and eavesdropping. Your conversations and text messages when using MediaRing Talk services are not secure.  
**YOUR CONSENT**  
  
By submitting your information, you consent to the use of that information and other information we collect as set out in this Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other parts of the web site so that you may become aware of the information we collect and how we use it. Your continued use of our services will signify your consent to the changes and to our use of your information.
