# Privacy Policy | Medialets

**Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers the websites at [www.medialets.com](http://www.medialets.com/), [www.medialytics.com](http://www.medialytics.com/), and any subsidiary websites (the “Sites”), owned and operated by Medialets, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) and any services which we provide to publishers of applications which operate on mobile devices and mobile websites designed for display on mobile devices and to end users of such applications (the “Services”).

As a general rule there are two categories of users of the Site and Services: “Publishers” who are operators or publishers of applications that use the Company technology to deliver advertisements in their mobile applications or mobile website, and “End Users” who are visitors or users of our Site, individual users of mobile applications or individual visitors of a mobile website. By visiting the Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

This Policy describes our practices with respect to you or your company’s personally identifiable information (“You”). In particular, it defines: 1) what personal information we collect, 2) how we collect personal information, 3) how we use personal information, 4) how we protect personal information, 5) with who, if anyone, we share personal information, and 6) how you can access or correct personal information.

Your privacy is important to us. Should you have any questions about our privacy policy, contact us a [privacy@medialets.com](mailto:privacy@medialets.com).

***SITES***

By visiting the Sites and/or using any Services provided on or through the Sites, you agree to the terms of this Policy in full and without modification. If you do not agree to the terms of the Policy, you do not have the right to access the Sites or to use any of the Services. If you visit the Sites, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and any applicable Terms of Service, including limitations on damages and the application of New York State law.

**The Information We Gather and How We Use it:** The Site and the Services are primarily directed to Publishers, although we welcome End Users who want to know more about our Services. When you access the Site or Services, we may collect the following information:

• Personal Information – We collect Personal Information when you knowingly provide it, including when you register for the Site, provide feedback, or request information. Personal Information is information that may be used to identify or locate an individual, like a person’s full name, postal address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this Personal Information. We use your Personal Information to administer your account and provide you Services, to send communications and administrative e-mails, to respond to your inquiries, and to send marketing and product update messages to those who request such messages. Typically, Publishers, rather than End Users visit the Site in order to access and register for the Services. For example, Publishers may provide their e-mail address when they register on the Site and create a user name and password. We may combine this information with other information about you that we receive from other sources, both on and offline, to improve the quality of our products and services and enhance your experience.

• Non-Personally Identifiable Information – We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information automatically when you visit our Site. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that is not used nor intended to be used to personally identify an individual and is not associated with, nor linked to, Personal Information. This Non-Personally Identifiable Information we collect via the Site includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and the web page you have visited immediately prior to visiting the Site.

**How Personal Information is Collected**

To serve you better, we use “cookie” technology. Cookies are alpha-numeric identifiers, usually stored on a user’s computer hard drive, which enable us to “personalize” the Sites for each user. Cookies also tell us how and when pages in our Sites are visited and by how many people. We generally use cookies to help with customer tracking and to reduce the time it takes for pages to load into your browser. Our cookies do not collect personal information. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and/or persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. Persistent cookies can be removed or blocked by following the help file directions in your Internet browser. If you elect to block cookies, you may not be able to access certain personalized sections of our Services, such as Publisher reports. We also use log files and cookies to improve the quality of our Site; to keep track of your login name, passwords, and pages you have visited on the Site; and to tailor content to your interests and to personalize the Site on your behalf.

When you visit our Sites, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends, including your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language and the date and time of your request. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how well the Sites are working so that we can continue to improve our product and services in order to benefit our customers.

When you contact us via contact forms on the Sites, send e-mails or conduct other communications to Medialets, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

**How Personal Information is Used**

We use the information we collect from you and your users to:

• Provide our products and services to users, including the display of customized content, identification, contact, information and authentication  
• Ensure the technical functionality of our products, services and network  
• Improve upon our products and services  
• Better understand the products and services that are of interest to our users

We may use personally identifiable information in an aggregate form to gain a broader perspective of what preferences our users have and to measure interest in the various areas of the Site. In some cases e-mail addresses or phone numbers may be used to contact users regarding service updates, confirmations, opt-in surveys and select partner offers. You may opt-out of receiving marketing messages regarding partner offers.

**How Personal Information is Protected**

Medialets takes all reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, including the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software that encrypts the information you supply to our Sites. We also take reasonable measures to safeguard personal information and to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of such information through our data collection, storage and security practices. You should take further precautions to protect personal data by safeguarding your user name and password and by limiting the use of shared computers. All personal information is stored on our secure servers in the United States of America.

• With third parties to whom you ask us to send Personal Information.  
• In addition, we may aggregate your anonymous information with the anonymous information of others and share that aggregated information with third parties without restriction.

Medialets may share aggregate information about you with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

**How Personal Information is Accessed or Corrected**

There may be residual Personal Information that remains within our databases, access logs, and other records. In addition, we are not responsible for updating or removing your Personal Information already disclosed to third parties who have been provided information as permitted by this Policy. You can opt-out of receiving certain e-mail communications from the Site by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each e-mail.
