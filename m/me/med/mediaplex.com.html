              <br>
              Mediaplex is the leader in providing advertising technology that 
              protects Internet users’ privacy. Our mobile Java objects architecture 
              was designed in anticipation of privacy concerns, and was engineered 
              from the ground up to be compliant with the world’s most stringent 
              privacy standards. For this reason, we do not maintain, share or 
              sell any personally identifiable data or anonymous user profile 
              information.</span> 
            </p><p class="text">We have always contended that the significant portion 
              of the focus of online advertising campaigns should be on the advertiser’s 
              business information rather than reliance on a viewer’s profile. 
              Our company is built on a proprietary technology called MOJO (for 
              mobile Java objects) that can dynamically configure ad messages 
              based on an advertiser’s internal data, such as pricing and 
              inventory levels, for the products or services they are promoting 
              online. As a result of this focus, we use non-personally identifiable 
              information provided by the Web sites, pursuant to their privacy 
              policies, about their viewers’ general demographics and interests 
              in order to target appropriate advertising to the sites.</p>
            <p class="text">In addition, if our clients have databases of their 
              customers, we can use this data on behalf of those clients, again 
              pursuant to their privacy policies. The premise is that both the 
              site providing the ad space and the advertiser (1) have a relationship 
              with the customer, (2) have an opportunity to share their privacy 
              policy with their customers, and (3) provide an opportunity to opt 
              out. As a third-party ad server, Mediaplex does not always have 
              a relationship with the user, and therefore it would be inappropriate 
              to build user profile information when such a relationship does 
              not exist.</p>

              <b>MOJO Mail is Mediaplex's Opt-In email Program</b><br>
              Mediaplex is a leading provider of advertising technology that deeply 
              respects and strives to protect Internet users' privacy. Our mobile 
              Java object (MOJO™) architecture allows marketers to dynamically 
              configure and customize outbound email messages at the time the 
              email is opened, thereby ensuring communication of timely, relevant 
              content and offers based on up-to-the-minute business data such 
              as price, inventory levels and customer purchasing history. This 
              technology enables our clients to provide the most current information 
              and offers to their customers and prospective customers who have 
              opted-in to receive promotional and other communications.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>MOJO Mail Requires Consent</b><br>
              Mediaplex's MOJO Mail is an opt-in email product used only to deliver 
              email to Web users who have opted-in to receive promotional offers 
              through an online relationship-marketing program. Mediaplex's client 
              contracts require that each client comply fully with Mediaplex's 
              privacy policy and specifically with the MOJO Mail opt-in requirement. 
              Mediaplex does not send, participate in or condone the use of unsolicited 
              commercial email (commonly referred to as "SPAM"). </p>
            <p class="text"><b>Type of Information used by Mediaplex's MOJO Mail</b><br>
              Our advertisers provide us with Web user information such as a name,

              accredited email list provider for the purpose of sending email 
              communications. Additional data can include information on transactions 
              that the participant has made with the advertiser. The purpose of

              its clients or collects on behalf of clients to send client communications, 
              including product updates, discounts and other pertinent information 
              to the opt-in participants of our clients' email initiatives. Any 
              available information about the participants' interests or previous 
              purchases can be used to personalize the email. Mediaplex does not

              other than intended by the Web user and our clients.</p>

              their MOJO Mail campaigns. For general reporting purposes on Mediaplex's 
              overall serving performance and capacity, we may report the total 
              number of emails delivered through our system on behalf of all email 
              clients for a specific time period, with no reference to individual 
              Web users, clients or campaigns. </p>
            <p class="text"><b>Security of the MOJO Mail program</b><br>

              way misused. Access by Mediaplex staff and clients is password-protected 
              and limited to certain individuals.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Email and children</b><br>
              Our clients must ensure that they will comply with all laws and 
              regulations concerning any email addresses that are protected by 
              the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). If our clients 
              have email programs for children under 13 years old, the clients 
              must guarantee that they have verifiable, parental consent that 
              is in full compliance with COPPA regulations.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>We urge consumers to check the email privacy policy 
              of a company before they participate in that company's program regarding:
