<p>Last Updated: &nbsp;May 30, 2012</p>
<p><strong>I. OVERVIEW</strong><br><br>Mediaplex, Inc. is dedicated to providing our products and services in a way that best assures the privacy of Internet Users. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") sets forth the privacy policies and practices of Mediaplex, Inc. ("Mediaplex", "we", "our" or "us"), a ValueClick, Inc. company ("ValueClick"), in providing services for our marketing clients ("Clients"), and to individuals who receive email or use a browser to access websites ("Internet Users").<br><br>For more information about ValueClick and other ValueClick companies please visit <a href="http://www.valueclick.com/">www.ValueClick.com</a><br><br><strong>II. SCOPE &amp; APPLICATION</strong><br><br>Mediaplex provides products and services to deliver and track advertisements and marketing messages over the Internet on behalf of clients such as advertisers, marketers and website publishers ("Clients"). Advertisements and communications sent through Mediaplex products and services derive from the sending Client, with Mediaplex acting as the delivery agent.<br><br>The collection, use, and disclosure of data collected by Mediaplex pursuant to its provision of services and products for its Client ("Mediaplex Services") are governed by this Privacy Policy. The collection, use and disclosure of data collected by any Client in connection with such Client's use of Mediaplex Services are governed by such Client's privacy policy which may differ from this Privacy Policy. While Mediaplex strongly encourages its Clients and business partners to adopt responsible approaches to online privacy, Mediaplex is not responsible for the information practices of Clients or their partners.<br><br>Please note that if you voluntarily choose to provide information to Mediaplex you consent to the practices and procedures detailed herein.<br><br>To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and a written agreement to which Mediaplex is party, the terms of such agreement shall prevail with respect to the parties to that agreement.<br><br><strong>III. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</strong><br><br><strong>A. Online Advertising</strong><br><br>Mediaplex offers Clients various online advertising products, including without limitation, MOJO Adserver, MOJO Publisher, and MOJO SEM. In the process of providing online advertising, Mediaplex does not collect any personally identifiable data, which is data collected with an intention to identify and contact a person such as name, address, telephone number or e-mail address ("PII") from Internet users with respect to such online advertising products. We may use technology such as click-stream, cookies, web beacons, log files and HTTP protocol elements to collect general data on the performance of our advertising campaigns so we can report aggregated results. This data is collected on an anonymous and non-personally identifiable basis. The non-personally identifiable information that Mediaplex collects may include, as an example, IP address, browser types, operating systems, domain names, access dates and times, referring website addresses, online transactions and browsing and search activity "Non-PII").<br><br>The Non-PII collected is used for the enhancement of our services to our Clients, marketing, and to more effectively match advertisements and website content to Internet users.<br><br><strong>B. Email Marketing</strong><br><br>Mediaplex offers Clients an email marketing product, MOJO Mail. MOJO Mail is used to configure and send email communications and promotional offers to permission-based email lists provided by its Clients. In this process, certain PII is stored and managed in MOJO Mail. This PII is provided by Client to Mediaplex. Mediaplex does collect general email campaign performance data in order to report aggregated results to Clients.<br><br><strong>C. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Log Files </strong><br><br>Mediaplex may serve online advertising as part of its Mediaplex Services. In doing so, Mediaplex may use Log files, Web beacons or Cookies on your computer and will use Non-PII collected as part of the Mediaplex Services to serve online advertisements for the Client.<br><br>"Log files" track actions occurring on websites and collect data, which may include your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.<br><br>"Web beacons" are electronic files used to track your data, which may include the navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.<br><br>"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see online advertisements. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows Clients to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.<br><br>There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) "Session Cookies", if used, are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) "Persistent Cookies" remain on your browser for up to 3 years from your last visit to the Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.<br><br>There are many misconceptions about cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. Mediaplex does not and cannot use cookies, log files or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer.<br><br>A useful resource on understanding cookies may be found at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.<br><br><strong>IV. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</strong><br><br>Data, including any PII or Non-PII, collected by Mediaplex from the Mediaplex Services shall be defined as "Information". Mediaplex may, from time to time, provide Information to third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative or program management services such as billing, delivery and payouts. Any such third-party vendor agrees to protect the confidentiality of Information provided by Mediaplex. Mediaplex may periodically use Information for strategic marketing information and other business related communications.<br><br>Please be aware that the websites of our Clients as well as the websites on which we serve advertisements or any third party websites may collect information from you. Such information may include non-personally identifiable information through the use of Cookies and other technology and any personally identifiable information you may choose to give in registering and transacting with such websites. You should check the applicable privacy policies of such websites you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you. Mediaplex also shares data that it collects in the provision of its Services to its related Clients and its affiliated entities for marketing purposes that includes providing advertisements about goods or services likely to be of greater interest to you.&nbsp; With respect to online behavioral advertising, such Clients and/or affiliated entities may use non-personally identifiable information collected or shared, including, but not limited to providing advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Typically a cookie or third party web beacon is used to collect this information.

This includes exchanging Information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.<br><br>Mediaplex also reserves the right to share any Non-PII with our affiliated entities, which may be combined with any PII that such affiliated entities have, or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, or reorganization or liquidation of any of the ValueClick companies.<br><br><strong>V. Data Security</strong><br><br>Mediaplex employs reasonable measures to ensure the security of all Information and we routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our services.<br><br>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. While we strive to protect your data, it may be possible for third parties not under the control of Mediaplex to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Mediaplex cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with Mediaplex.<br><br><strong>VI. CHOICE AND ACCESS</strong><br><br><strong>A. Opting </strong><strong>Out</strong><strong> of Interest Based Advertising</strong><br><br>Mediaplex also offers an "opt-out Cookie" to block the placement of future Mediaplex Cookies on your system for 10 years from the time you opted out. If you have multiple internet browsers or users on the same computer, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each browser and/or user.

Please report any problems related to the opt-out process by filling out our <a href="http://www.valueclick.com/feedback?t=o&amp;r=mplx-mpp01">Corporate Feedback Form</a>.<br><br>Most Internet browsers give you the option of adjusting their settings which allow you to automatically refuse cookies either generally or from specific sites. To adjust these settings, we suggest that you contact the supplier of you browser and browser add-ons for more information.<br><br><strong>B. Opting </strong><strong>Out of Email </strong><br><br>You can control the email you receive through Mediaplex MOJO Mail. To opt-out of emails sent by Mediaplex Clients using MOJO Mail:<br><br>&nbsp; § Click the unsubscribe link that at the bottom of the email.<br>&nbsp; § Reply to the message with "unsubscribe" in the Subject line or body of the email.<br><br>If you have attempted to opt out without success, forward a copy of the email you are trying to opt-out of along with your full name and email address to <a href="mailto:customersupport@mediaplex.com">customersupport@mediaplex.com</a> so that we can investigate and resolve the problem.<br><br><strong>C.

<p><strong>FOR EUOPEAN UNION </strong><strong>AND SWISS </strong><strong>CITIZENS</strong><br><br>The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws.
