<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<div id="mainprodblock" class="maintexts">

    <p><b>Information We&nbsp;Collect</b><br>
    We&nbsp;recognize your right to&nbsp;confidentiality and are
    committed to&nbsp;protecting your privacy. We&nbsp;use the
    information that we&nbsp;collect on&nbsp;our Web sites
    to&nbsp;provide you with a&nbsp;superior shopping experience
    and to&nbsp;communicate with you about products, services, and
    promotions.</p>

    <p><b>Your Account</b><br>
    When you place an&nbsp;order, we&nbsp;will ask you to&nbsp;set
    up&nbsp;“your account” which includes your name,
    email address, mailing address, credit card number and
    expiration date, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;certain other information
    when you order prescriptions. Using your account information,
    we&nbsp;will send you communications that we&nbsp;believe are
    relevant to&nbsp;you, including prescription refill and renewal
    reminders, newsletters and emails. If&nbsp;you prefer not
    to&nbsp;receive optional emails or&nbsp;other communications
    from us,&nbsp;you may adjust your account to&nbsp;prevent such
    communications by&nbsp;send us&nbsp;an&nbsp;email.</p>

    <p><b>Customer Reviews</b><br>
    We&nbsp;are pleased to&nbsp;hear from our customers and welcome
    your comments regarding our products. Customer Reviews allow
    other customers to&nbsp;see what you think about
    a&nbsp;product. We&nbsp;allow you the option of&nbsp;sharing
    your review anonymously by&nbsp;selecting
    “Anonymous” when submitting your review.</p>

    <p><b>Your Prescription Information</b><br>
    To&nbsp;fill your prescription drug order, we&nbsp;collect the
    following additional information: your date of&nbsp;birth,
    gender, drug allergies, medical conditions, illnesses, and
    current medications. If&nbsp;you plan to&nbsp;use insurance and
    you can’t&nbsp;find the member or&nbsp;group number,
    we&nbsp;ask that you provide your Social Security Number. Your
    Social Security Number is&nbsp;only used for purposes
    of&nbsp;seeking reimbursement from insurance companies.</p>

    <p><b>Information Automatically Collected</b><br>
    We&nbsp;automatically receive and collect certain types
    of&nbsp;information whenever you visit our Web stores. For
    example, like many Web sites, we&nbsp;use “cookies”
    and obtain certain types of&nbsp;information when your Web
    browser accesses our Web sites. This information includes the
    Internet protocol (IP)&nbsp;address of&nbsp;your computer, your
    browser software and operating system, your web server, the
    date and time you access our site, session information (such
    as&nbsp;download errors and page response times), information
    about your viewing, search and purchase history and information
    about the referring URL and the URL clickstream
    to,&nbsp;through, and from our Web sites. We&nbsp;use this
    information to&nbsp;monitor the usage and performance
    of&nbsp;our site, to&nbsp;enhance our customers’ search
    and shopping experiences and to&nbsp;determine aggregate
    information about our user base and usage patterns.</p>

    <p><b>Information From Third Parties</b><br>
    If&nbsp;we&nbsp;receive updated account information from third
    parties, we&nbsp;may revise your account for you so&nbsp;that
    we&nbsp;can efficiently process your orders, deliver your
    packages or&nbsp;otherwise communicate with you. For example,
    we&nbsp;may receive customer information from our shippers
    or&nbsp;from third parties with which we&nbsp;operate
    co-branded businesses. In&nbsp;addition, we&nbsp;may acquire
    customer names, email addresses and mailing addresses for
    select mailings from third parties.</p>

    <p><b>Other Information You Provide</b><br>
    We&nbsp;collect additional information that you choose
    to&nbsp;give us.&nbsp;For example, you provide information
    to&nbsp;us&nbsp;when you complete surveys or&nbsp;contest entry
    forms, add items to&nbsp;cart (if&nbsp;cart is&nbsp;available),
    sign up&nbsp;for special discounts or&nbsp;coupons, communicate
    with us&nbsp;by&nbsp;email, phone or&nbsp;otherwise, provide
    product reviews, or&nbsp;provide alternative delivery
    addresses.</p>

    <p><b>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</b><br>
    We&nbsp;protect all of&nbsp;your information against
    unauthorized access or&nbsp;release. We&nbsp;share your
    personal and prescription information with third parties
    as&nbsp;follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Brand Manufacturers&nbsp;— We&nbsp;may develop
        programs with some of&nbsp;our brand manufacturers through
        which you may be&nbsp;offered special discounts
        or&nbsp;coupons on&nbsp;products in&nbsp;exchange for
        providing your email address or&nbsp;completing
        a&nbsp;survey about the manufacturer’s&nbsp;products.
        When you are offered such discounts or&nbsp;coupons
        in&nbsp;exchange for providing information (for example,
        giving your email address or&nbsp;completing
        a&nbsp;survey), you will be&nbsp;notified that if&nbsp;you
        choose to&nbsp;participate, your name, email address and
        responses will be&nbsp;shared with the brand manufacturer.
        No&nbsp;other information will be&nbsp;shared.</li>

        <li>Agents&nbsp;— We&nbsp;may enter into agreements
        with other companies or&nbsp;individuals to&nbsp;perform
        functions on&nbsp;our behalf. These functions may include
        sending promotional emails on&nbsp;our behalf to&nbsp;such
        companies’ customers; serving advertisements
        on&nbsp;our behalf, analyzing data; providing marketing
        assistance; processing credit card or&nbsp;debit card
        payments; and fulfilling and delivering orders. These
        companies and individuals have access to&nbsp;only
        to&nbsp;information necessary to&nbsp;perform their
        functions. They are not allowed to&nbsp;use the information
        for any other purpose and are contractually obligated
        to&nbsp;maintain the confidentiality and security
        of&nbsp;the information. We&nbsp;may share non-personal,
        summary, or&nbsp;aggregate customer data with partners and
        other third parties.</li>

        <li>Business Transfers&nbsp;— We&nbsp;may buy
        or&nbsp;sell stores or&nbsp;assets. In&nbsp;such
        transactions, customer information is&nbsp;usually treated
        as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the transferred business assets. Should
        our company or&nbsp;substantially all of&nbsp;either
        of&nbsp;their assets be&nbsp;sold, customer information
        will be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the transferred business assets.
        In&nbsp;that event, we&nbsp;will post a&nbsp;notification
        on&nbsp;this page or&nbsp;send you an&nbsp;email
        so&nbsp;that you are always aware of&nbsp;how your
        information is&nbsp;being used.</li>

        <li>Compliance with Law; Protection of&nbsp;Rights,
        Property or&nbsp;Safety&nbsp;— We&nbsp;will disclose
        account and other personal information when we&nbsp;believe
        that disclosure is&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;comply with the
        law, to&nbsp;enforce or&nbsp;apply our Terms of&nbsp;Use
        or&nbsp;other policies or&nbsp;user agreements,
        or&nbsp;to&nbsp;protect the rights, property,
        or&nbsp;safety of&nbsp;our business, our customers,
        or&nbsp;others.</li>

        <li>As&nbsp;You Direct&nbsp;— If&nbsp;you direct,
        we&nbsp;will release prescription or&nbsp;other customer
        information to&nbsp;your authorized representative, the
        prescribing or&nbsp;other authorized practitioner caring
        for you, or&nbsp;such other person as&nbsp;you may direct.
        At&nbsp;the direction of&nbsp;the patient and to&nbsp;the
        extent specifically authorized by&nbsp;law, we&nbsp;will
        release such information to&nbsp;other persons, including
        insurance plans. For example, at&nbsp;your request
        we&nbsp;will automatically forward your prescription
        information to&nbsp;your insurance plan so&nbsp;that our
        company can directly handle reimbursement of&nbsp;your
        prescription purchase on&nbsp;your behalf.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <br>

    <p>From time to&nbsp;time, we&nbsp;may partner with certain
    companies who, in&nbsp;conjunction with their membership
    programs or&nbsp;rewards programs, require that
    we&nbsp;disclose purchasing information about their members who
    visit our Web store (for example, to&nbsp;earn points for
    purchases made on&nbsp;our site through links from the partner
    site). We&nbsp;will disclose only the information required
    to&nbsp;make these programs work for you and support your
    membership in&nbsp;them. In&nbsp;addition, we&nbsp;disclose
    this information to&nbsp;such companies only if&nbsp;you have
    consented first, including consent implied by&nbsp;your
    agreement to&nbsp;the membership or&nbsp;participation rules.
    If&nbsp;you do&nbsp;not want us&nbsp;to&nbsp;disclose that
    information to&nbsp;the strategic partner, then you must
    contact the partner directly. Other than as&nbsp;set out above,
    you will receive notice when information about you might
    go&nbsp;to&nbsp;third parties, and you will have
    an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;choose not to&nbsp;share the
    information.</p>

    <p><b>Security</b><br>
    When you place an&nbsp;order online or&nbsp;use our site, your
    personal information and credit card or&nbsp;debit card
    information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology
    before being sent over the Internet, We&nbsp;use SSL technology
    to&nbsp;prevent your information from being stolen
    or&nbsp;intercepted while being transferred
    to&nbsp;us.&nbsp;Your credit card information is&nbsp;always
    stored in&nbsp;encrypted form in&nbsp;a&nbsp;restricted-access
    database that is&nbsp;away from our Web site database
    so&nbsp;it&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;the
    Internet, to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;safe from hackers.</p>

    <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
    To&nbsp;personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping
    experience, we&nbsp;use a&nbsp;feature on&nbsp;your Internet
    browser called a&nbsp;cookie. Cookies are small files that your
    Web browser places on&nbsp;your computer’s&nbsp;hard
    drive. We&nbsp;use cookies to&nbsp;let us&nbsp;know that you
    are a&nbsp;prior customer and to&nbsp;retrieve certain
    information previously provided by&nbsp;you
    to&nbsp;us,&nbsp;so&nbsp;that you do&nbsp;not need
    to&nbsp;re-enter this information every time you shop
    at&nbsp;the site. Cookies also let us&nbsp;know how you found
    us&nbsp;(e.g., through a&nbsp;particular web site
    or&nbsp;advertisement). Cookies are not used to&nbsp;access
    information entered on&nbsp;the secure server. This information
    can be&nbsp;accessed only when you enter your name and
    password. If&nbsp;you choose to&nbsp;configure your browser
    to&nbsp;remove or&nbsp;reject our cookies, you will not
    be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;make purchases from our Web stores
    or&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;many of&nbsp;our features.</p>

    <p><b>Unsolicited Email (SPAM)</b><br>
    Your privacy is&nbsp;very important
    to&nbsp;us.&nbsp;Be&nbsp;assured that, in&nbsp;accordance with
    this privacy policy, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not sell
    or&nbsp;distribute our customer list to&nbsp;third parties. You
    should be&nbsp;aware, however, that unscrupulous marketers can
    sometimes “harvest” your email address directly
    from your computer or&nbsp;another person’s&nbsp;address
    book or&nbsp;even obtain your email address through programs
    that automatically search web pages and email traffic for email
    addresses.</p>

    <p><b>Children</b><br>
    We&nbsp;do&nbsp;not sell products for purchase
    by&nbsp;children. We&nbsp;sell children’s&nbsp;products
    for purchase by&nbsp;adults. If&nbsp;you are under 18,&nbsp;you
    may use our Web site only with the involvement
    of&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent or&nbsp;guardian.</p>

    <p><b>Linked Web Sites</b><br>
    Our Web stores may contain links to&nbsp;and from other sites
    operated and maintained by&nbsp;separate companies.
    We&nbsp;have no&nbsp;responsibility for linked Web sites
    (including the Web sites of&nbsp;participants in&nbsp;our
    associate program) and provide these links solely for the
    convenience and information of&nbsp;our visitors. The privacy
    policies of&nbsp;these sites may differ from our policy,
    so&nbsp;you should always review the privacy statement
    of&nbsp;each linked Web site you visit.</p>

    <p><b>Your Consent</b><br>
    By&nbsp;using our Web site (including through our customer
    service line), you consent to&nbsp;the collection, use, and
    disclosure of&nbsp;information in&nbsp;accordance with the
    terms of&nbsp;this privacy policy. We&nbsp;reserve the right
    to&nbsp;modify or&nbsp;amend this policy at&nbsp;any time.
    If&nbsp;we&nbsp;ever change our privacy policy, we&nbsp;will
    post any changes on&nbsp;this page or&nbsp;send you
    an&nbsp;email so&nbsp;that you are always aware of&nbsp;the
    information that we&nbsp;collect, how we&nbsp;use it,&nbsp;and
    under what circumstances we&nbsp;disclose it.&nbsp;Unless
    we&nbsp;clearly state otherwise, the changes to&nbsp;our
    privacy policy will affect only the information we&nbsp;collect
    after the effective date of&nbsp;the change.</p>

    <p><b>Your Comments</b><br>
    We&nbsp;welcome your feedback. If&nbsp;you have questions
    or&nbsp;comments about our privacy policies, feel free
