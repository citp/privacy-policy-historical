<a name="robots"></a><h3> How do I prevent my Mediasite content from being indexed by Mediasite.com and other search engines? </h3>

<p>The mediasite.com search engine (MiteBot) obeys the <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html" target="_offsite">Robot Exclusion Standard</a>.  MiteBot will obey all entries in the robots.txt file located at a website's root directory with a User-agent containing "MiteBot" or "*".</p> 
<p>
Disallowed documents, including slash (the home page of the site), are not indexed.  If a page has robots.txt entries disallowing it to be crawled, mediasite.com will not use the contents of that page. </p>
<p>
Example robots.txt:</p>
<p>
# Disallow the mediasite.com search engine <br>
User-agent: MiteBot<br>
Disallow: /mediasite/viewer <br>
<br>
# Disallow all search engines<br> 
User-agent: *<br>
Disallow: /mediasite/viewer <br>
