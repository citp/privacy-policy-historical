<p><b>5. Confidentiality and Security of Personal Information</b></p>

<p>The Website contains links to other sites on the Internet. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, actions or the content of such sites or the third parties that control such sites. We suggest contacting the parties controlling such sites or accessing their online policies for the relevant information about their data collection and privacy policy practices. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard.</p>

<p>We may also make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed by you in these areas becomes public information. We have no control over the use of these areas and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information. You disclosure of such information may prompt the delivery of unsolicited messages from others. Remember, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password (if applicable), and you are solely responsible for your activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Website and for any use of the Website or any other activity or conduct in connection with the Website by others who may use your user name and password, unless and until you notify of us that such information has been misappropriated, compromised or stolen.</p>
