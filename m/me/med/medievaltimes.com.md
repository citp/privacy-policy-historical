# Medieval Times Dinner & Tournament » Privacy Policy

At Medieval Times Entertainment, Inc. we respect your privacy while visiting our website. This privacy policy explains how we handle any information we may collect while operating MedievalTimes.com.

Website Visitors

Like the majority of website operators, Medieval Times collects non-personally-indentifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, referring site and the date and time of each visitor request. Medieval Times' purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying information is to better understand how visitors use its website. This data, in the aggregate, allows Medieval Times to improve its website.

Medieval Times also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Medieval Times does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Medieval Times' website choose to interact with Medieval Times in ways that require Medieval Times to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Medieval Times gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, when you send questions or comments through our website or opt-in to receive information and offers from Medieval Times, we require a valid email address. Those who engage in transactions with Medieval Times - by purchasing tickets for an upcoming show, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Medieval Times collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Medieval Times. Medieval Times does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics

Medieval Times may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Medieval Times may monitor the most popular items within the online Gift Shoppe. Medieval Times may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Medieval Times does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Medieval Times discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (I) need to know that information in order to process it on Medieval Times' behalf or to provide services available at Medieval Times' website, and (II) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Medieval Times' website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Medieval Times will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying or personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Medieval Times discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Medieval Times believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Medieval Times, third parties or the public at large.

If you have signed up for the Noble Guests or Birthday Fellowship programs and have supplied your email address, Medieval Times may occasionally send you an email to tell you about upcoming special offers and promotions, new website and show features, solicit your feedback and the like. If you send us a comment on your experience, we reserve the right to publish it on this website and will attribute the comment only to your first name and, if provided, your city and state/province.

Medieval Times takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Cookies
