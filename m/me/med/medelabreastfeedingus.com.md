(this “Site”).  This Privacy Policy applies only to this Site, not to any other web sites that may be accessible from here.  Please note that when you access any external links from this Site, they may have different privacy policies specific to those sites. We encourage you to read all applicable privacy policies.

**Please remember that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by our Site.   We are not responsible for the privacy of any information you reveal or post in any public forum (e.g., message board, blog, personal page, etc.) or through any public feature available on our Site, or for the privacy practices of websites that are operated or owned by third parties.  **

By visiting this Site, you accept that your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions).  If you have any concern about a privacy issue, please contact us as directed in this Privacy Policy.  Medela, Inc. reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy.

**What Personal Information Do We Gather From Those Who Visit Our Site?**

When you visit the Site, you may provide us with two types of information: information you voluntarily submit, and information that we automatically collect as you browse our Site.

**Information You Voluntarily Submit**

We collect and store any information you enter on our Site, or provide to us in offline contacts we have with you.  Some of this information may be personally identifiable (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your name, business name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, etc.).  When you visit the Site, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily.  Also, if you place an order, you may be required to provide financial information.

Information is collected from visitors to the Site in the following areas:

  * **Registration Forms  
****** If you choose to register for the Site, or for specific events, contests and newsletters on various areas of the Site, we will generally ask you to provide both personal and demographic information, such as contact information and preferences regarding the event or material for which you desire to register, most of which is required to complete the registration.  We will inform you which information is optional.  You may visit our Site without registering, but you may not be able to access certain areas or services.
  * **Order Forms  
**Some areas of the Site may allow you to order products or services, whether or not for a fee.  In connection with these transactions, we collect data necessary to complete the transaction and that is furnished by you.  This may include contact information, date of birth, email address, telephone number and your credit card number.  We may also collect information about gift recipients so that we can fulfill a gift purchase.
  * **Surveys  
****** At times, you may be asked to complete survey questions that appear on the Site.
  * **Employment Applications**  
You may submit information related to job opportunities with Medela, Inc.
  * **Discussion Forums**  
We may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to our users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
  * **Wish Lists**  
We may allow you to create Wish Lists of Medela products that can be shared with family and friends by email. To send those emails, we will collect the email addresses that you give us in order to send the Wish List information to your friends and family.  ****
  * **Email  
**On several screens of our Site, you also have an opportunity to communicate with us by email. You may also choose to provide your email address to receive communications from us or third parties.
  * **Information We Automatically Collect**  
When you browse and navigate through our Site, certain information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means. Like most web site operators, we track IP addresses (the Internet address of your computer), the web pages visited and the time of visits, and other clickstream data.  The only other type of information automatically provided to us is the type of computer, operating system and browser you are using.  This information is provided by your browser, which we use to improve the performance of our Site. ****  
We may also place small data files, called “cookies”, in the browser file of your computer’s hard drive.  These cookies automatically identify your browser to our server whenever you interact with the Site.  We use the cookies to record Site statistics.  Most browsers automatically accept the cookies, but you usually can change your browser setting to prevent the acceptance of cookies.  Certain web pages may not function properly if you choose not to accept cookies.  
We do not collect personally identifiable information automatically, but we may tie information collected automatically to your previously submitted personally identifiable information.



**How We Use Your Personal Information**  
We use your personal information to communicate with you if and when necessary in connection with your use of our Site, to respond to your questions, or to send you material and information you request. 

We may collect, track and/or use your information to:

  * Personalize your site experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product information in which you are most interested.
  * Consider your suggestions.
  * Possibly respond directly to you for clarification.
  * Process your request for materials if you make one.
  * Try to and answer your questions if you ask them.
  * Register you for an event, contest or sweepstakes, if you request it.
  * Store your grades for our education programs and track your continuing education credits
  * Provide you with email messages and other information regarding upcoming events, new services and general information about our products and services. (Note: you may elect not to receive these communications, either when you initially register at our Site, or at any time thereafter. See the section of this Privacy Policy called “Choice/Opt Out.”).



We may also use your web site information in order to help diagnose problems with our Site.  We may use all information we collect to analyze statistical use patterns and demographic data (basically, where our visitors come from and what demographic characteristics they have) and to improve our Site to better serve our customers.  We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Site.  Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.  We may also prepare and keep statistical records and other data about you and other users of our Site, but we do that in a way that does not identify you or any other user personally.  We may hire third parties to help us collect and analyze such data, and we may share such statistical data with third parties.  Again, such statistical data will not specifically identify you or any other user.  We use this information to help us make our Site more useful to visitors - to learn about the number of visitors to our Site, what part of the Site they are interested in, how long the use the Site, and the types of technology our visitors use.

**Disclosing Your Personal Information To Others**

Except in the limited circumstances stated in this paragraph, we do not currently sell, rent, license, trade or otherwise disclose the personal information of our Site visitors to unaffiliated third parties, but may do so in the future.  We may disclose your information to service providers who assist us in operating the Site or conducting our business.  We may also share such information among our affiliates as necessary to provide you with the information and services you request or in which you may otherwise be interested.  We may disclose information about you if and when we believe it is necessary to comply with any law, rule, court order, or subpoena, or to enforce our legal rights or the [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions), or to protect our business, property and operations, or in connection with a sale, acquisition, merger or other business combination or assignment of our business with or to a third party or in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person.  We may also disclose non-personally identifiable visitor information to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.

Some areas of the Site may allow you to conduct e-commerce transactions (purchasing products, event registration, donation, game and sweepstakes participation, etc.). In connection with such transactions, we collect data necessary to complete the transaction that is furnished by you.  This information may be furnished to a third party in order to facilitate the transaction.

We feature public forums where you and other users of our Site can communicate with one another, such as the Medela Community section of the Site.   **THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT PROTECT YOU WHEN YOU USE OUR PUBLIC FORUMS OR PROVIDE INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION) ABOUT YOURSELF THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROFILE FEATURE OR THROUGH ANY COMMUNITY AREA AVAILABLE ON OUR SITE.**  You should be aware that any information shared in a public forum such as a message board, blog, personal page, posting, group, bulletin board is public information and may be seen or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy, although the availability of personal pages or groups identified as “private” may be limited to certain permitted users.  You should think carefully before disclosing any information in any public forum, on our Site.

Some of our advertisers may display ads on the Site that solicit, or contain technology to collect, information about our users.  This information is collected and used by our advertisers, and is outside of our control.  If you have any questions about an advertisement, you should contact the responsible advertiser directly.
