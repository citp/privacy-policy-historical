##  5\. Types of Data We Collect. 

" **Personal Data** " means data that, by itself, allows someone to identify or contact you as an individual, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. " **Anonymous Data** " means data that does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons and that is not associated with or linked to Personal Data. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below. 

  1. ###  Information You Provide to Us. 

    * We may collect your e-mail address and password when you create an account to log in to our network (" **Account** "). 
    * When you order products or gift cards on our Site, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information, and shipping address information. 
    * If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will collect your e-mail address. 
    * If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in your e-mail to us, in order to send you a reply.

  2. ###  Information You Provide to Social Networking Sites. 

If you elect to sign in to your Account via a social networking site (" **SNS** "), you are allowing us to access information stored by the SNS, including, without limitation, information in your public profile and your email address, and you are agreeing to the SNS’s terms of use in your use of the Services. We may receive information from the SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site and provide you with relevant content. Any information that we collect from your SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have selected with that SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy policy and data practices. 

  3. ###  Information Collected via Technology.

To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information from your computer or device, including but not limited to: 

      * The date and time of your visit and the web pages and content you view and links you click on while navigating within our Services; 
      * Information about the type of content accessed via our Services; 
      * The site you visited before and after visiting our Site; 
      * Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that other computers connected to the Internet can communicate with your browser online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area; 
      * Search terms you enter using our Services or on a referral site; 
      * Unique identifiers, including non-global mobile device identification numbers; 
      * Information about your device such as your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, Internet domain, TCP configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software installed on your device; and

    * Pixel Tags. 

In addition, we use " **Pixel Tags** " (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages and e-mail messages. We may use Pixel Tags to collect information about your interactions with our email messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read emails.

The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Site (the " **Analytics Information** ") is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s terms of use and privacy policy. By using our Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at [support@meundies.com](mailto:support@meundies.com)

  4. ###  Information Collected from You About Others. 

    * If you send a gift card to a third party, we will collect both your and the third party’s name and e-mail address in order to send the third party an electronic gift card. 
    * If you decide to invite a third party to purchase our products, we will collect your and the third party’s name, e-mail address, and/or social media account username in order to send a promotional message to the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to contact the third party. You or the third party may contact us at [support@meundies.com](mailto:support@meundies.com) to request the removal of this information from our database. To make the referral process easier, we provide you the opportunity to import contact information directly from your address book. With your permission, we will access your address book and import your contacts’ information to facilitate the referral process.
