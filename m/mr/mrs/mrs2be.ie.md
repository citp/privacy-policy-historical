## Outside providers and embedded objects

From time to time we may partner with an external provider or an advertiser to provide other services, for example we may ask an external company to carry out a survey or to run a competition. If any personal information is required you will be advised beforehand.

Mrs2be.ie and Mum2be.ie may also contain some other embedded objects such as images or videos which come from other web sites. Those sites do not have access to identifying personal details of users such as usernames or email addresses. These other sites maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal information. It is the responsibility of the user to review these policies for themselves.

## Changes to this privacy policy

We may make changes to this privacy policy from time to time. When we do we will notify registered users by email.

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

## Passwords

Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure and so that we cannot tell what it is. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstances will anyone affiliated with us or any third party legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the I forgot my password feature provided by the software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your email, and then the software will generate a new password to reclaim your account and email it to you.

You may choose to modify your browser preferences to reject cookies in this case, however, you may find yourself unable to access certain features of the site which are limited to registered users. Unless you choose otherwise, we will use only temporary session cookies (which are deleted at the end of each session on the site) and not persistent cookies.
