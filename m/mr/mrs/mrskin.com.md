# Mr. Skin's Privacy Policy

At _**MrSkin.com**_ we respect and protect your privacy. Our site is a safe environment for anyone who visits and becomes a member or purchases items from us. As an entertainment related products and services provider, we are committed to providing you the best possible online service and experience as well as the best products. The purpose of this policy statement is to fully share with you how we feel about the most important aspects of using this site.

**What information does _MrSkin.com_ collect and how is it used?**

**A.** When you visit the MrSkin.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with thousands of other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.

**B.** Our site will eventually use cookies to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored content. We also use cookies to remember information you gave us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the site. By showing us how and when members and shoppers use the site, cookies also help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on data such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. You will not be able to order from MrSkin.com using the Shopping Cart if you turn off the cookies option.

**C.** When you become a member with us or buy items from this site, or post to a discussion, you provide such personal information as: 

First and last name  
Billing address  
Shipping address(es)  
Email address  
Phone number  
Credit card account number

We use this information as follows:

**1.** We fulfill your order based on this information.

**2.** We provide you with information about your order (such as whether your order has been received, processed, or shipped).

**3.** We ask for your phone number (but it's not required) in the event that our customer service representatives need to contact you and cannot reach you by email. We save the information about products you purchased to provide you with the best possible customer service and the most up-to-date information about your order. Mr. Skin will never call you!

**4.** We use your mailing address not only to ship your orders to you but also to tell you about special offers, available only to MrSkin.com customers and members, that we think will interest you. You can always tell us that you don't want to receive these updates through our [customer service form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214071605id_/http%3A//www.mrskin.com/contact.htm), and we will remove your name from our mailing list.

**5.** Credit card information is used to bill you for products you have ordered and to track sales. We use CCBill.com, Paycom.net, VXSBill.com and 2000charge.net for these transactions. They are one of the largest and oldest e-commerce billing companies today. Their expertise in making sure that your transaction over the Internet is secure and confidential is unsurpassed in the industry. MrSkin.com will always use the most secure methods for payment available for the safety and comfort of our valued members and visitors.

**6.** The e-mail address members supply us with is never sold to any other website owner or merchant. We hate junk mail as much as you. This is why we will only send you e-mail about items that we feel you should know about. This includes special promotional items that Mr. Skin personally endorses, membership changes, terms and conditions changes, Holiday cards, and as always, the latest happenings on MrSkin.com. If you would like not to be notified by e-mail or would like to change you e-mail address, please send us a note with the [customer service form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214071605id_/http%3A//www.mrskin.com/contact.htm) and let us know how we can best serve you.

**Credit Card Processing and Security**

Shopping with MrSkin.com is absolutely safe -- you never have to worry about credit-card safety when you are shopping at our site. We guarantee that each purchase you make is protected and safe. If fraudulent charges are ever made, you will not have to pay for them.

We use the latest encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. All your ordering information -- including your name, address, and credit card number -- is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. Your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. To ensure that your information is even more secure, once we receive your credit card information, it is stored it on a server that isn't accessible from the Internet.

Credit-card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. If you feel more comfortable doing so, you are welcome to pay by check through the mail. See the join page for further information on paying by personal or certified check. At this time we are not able to accept phone orders.

**Special Promotional Offers**

From time to time MrSkin.com would like to share with you special promotional offers from other companies, which have been specially screened by us. These offers would provide valuable savings to you. All MrSkin.com customers will be given the opportunity to not receive these offers if they prefer, simply send us a note with the [customer service form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214071605id_/http%3A//www.mrskin.com/contact.htm) and let us know you would not like to be notified of special offers and promotions.

**How does _MrSkin.com_ protect the privacy of children younger than 18?**

MrSkin.com supports all the efforts of the current on-line movement to restrict access to adult content sites. We support efforts to restrict access but do not believe that the so-called age verification services that are available today are more than thinly veiled attempts of entrepreneurs trying to turn a buck. We restrict the images that are available to the general visitor to fully clothed or scantily clad appearances in films by the actresses that are listed on our site. We do not want our junior visitors to be left out from the information that is available, but we do not want to contribute to their delinquency by allowing sexually oriented content to be viewed without first obtaining a credit card number as a way of verifying their age. Let's face it, if you want to get in to see the pictures, you're going to have to pay for it.

**Other**

By using the MrSkin.com site, you consent to the collection and use of your information by MrSkin.com as described in this policy.
