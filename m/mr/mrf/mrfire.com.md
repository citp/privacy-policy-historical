Joe Vitale respects consumer privacy. This statement provides information about the data we collect, things done with data, and explains that we do not share data with other companies. 

**Information gathered through cookies**

We use "cookies" to establish a session identifier (in technical terms, to maintain state) and recognize a visitor from page to page so we can maintain a "shopping cart" with a list of products a visitor may wish to order. All "cookies" expire half an hour after you leave the site, unless you place an order and indicate you want us to set a cookie for your convenience so you will not have to enter order information on subsequent visits (please note that we do not save bank card data as browser cookies or on the server in any form). Because we use "cookies", if you enter your email address on one form, you will not need to type it again on certain forms. 

Information gathered through forms 

  * Email Address 
  * Person's Name 
  * Postal Address 
  * Phone Number 
  * Fax Number 
  * Credit Card Information 

This information is gathered when a request for a free offer or an order is placed so that it can be fulfilled properly. The visitor's name and address are required for delivery by mail. The phone number is necessary because if a question arises with an order, we need to be able to contact our customer. The email address is necessary so that we can send an acknowledgment. 

  * Marketing Profile 

Information we request on forms, including "tell us how you discovered this web site" is used to refine our marketing efforts so we can identify other visitors like you with minimal cost and reduce the likelihood of intruding on consumers who are not likely to be interested in our products and services. We will use the "opt-in" email address to send updates or announcements about the site and Joe Vitale's products and services if the visitor indicates interest. 


**What we do with the information collected through forms**

  * Contact you by email 
  * Contact you by mail 
  * Contact you by phone 
  * Save to improve site 



We take orders and requests for free offers that are then used to ship products and free samples. The visitor's name, address, phone, fax, and email address are only used by Joe Vitale and are not shared with third parties.
