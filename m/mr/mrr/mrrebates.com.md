# Mr. Rebates - Privacy Policy

#### 

#### Personal Data  
Only a user's email address is collected when users provide registration to Mr. Rebates. You agree that Mr. Rebates may send you periodical emails promoting coupons and specials from the Mr. Rebates merchant base that may be of interest to you. All Mr. Rebates email newsletters can be opted out of by simply clicking on a link within each email to remove your email address from the list.  Email addresses are never shared or sold to third-party marketers or third-party agencies. 

When a rebate check is sent to a Mr. Rebates member, it is necessary for the member to supply his/her postal address.  All postal address information is kept in the strictest confidence in our secure database system.  Postal address information is not shared or sold to third parties.

#### Aggregated Information  
Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit and information volunteered by users, is collected through various methods. For example, Mr. Rebates collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from Mr. Rebates, our servers log your IP address. Mr. Rebates only uses IP addresses for the purposes of web traffic analysis and trends.

 **Use of Cookies**  
Mr. Rebates also uses “cookies” to store information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow Mr. Rebates to measure activity on the site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences.

You may occasionally get cookies from our cash-back partner stores, which is standard in the Internet industry. Mr. Rebates does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to Mr. Rebates' privacy policies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.

####  To California Residents:  
Mr. Rebates only collects "personally identifiable" information when a member requests a rebate check.  That information is not shared with any other third-party.

Mr. Rebates encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children.

Individuals under 13

No information should be submitted to or posted on Mr. Rebates by users under the age of 13 years without the consent of their parent or guardian.

Individuals 13 through 17

Mr. Rebates requests that children under the age of 18 do not submit or post information to the site without a parent or guardian’s consent.
