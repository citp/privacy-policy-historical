# Hiya Security

At Hiya, our mission is to provide a better phone experience. Our goal is simple - we want to arm you with rich real-time information to determine whether or not to pick up an incoming call. We also believe that protecting you from unwanted calls starts with protecting your personal data, especially your phone information. While we explain how we do this in our [privacy policy](https://hiya.com/hiya-data-policy), here, we detail why we access your phone, and consequently, what we do and do not do with your information. 

Although we do not require it, allowing access to your contact list helps us to identify callers under the name you prefer to see, and to filter out numbers that may look spammy, but are actually legitimate for you (like your Doctor's office).

We will never access your personal data without asking your permission. If you do allow Hiya to access your contact list, this information does not leave your phone. Further, Hiya does not sell your phone information to third parties, and we don’t use the information to market to you or anyone else.

We request permission to access your phone so that our services can work their best. Access to your call log is required for our app to work, while access to other data on your phone is strictly optional. If you allow it, access to your phone information allows us to do such things as identify and block unwanted calls for you, and to let you dial numbers from within the Hiya app.

At Hiya, we want you to be in control of your phone experience which includes providing you with the ability to change the information you have shared with us as well as add, correct or remove any personal information already available in our products and services.
