### **SECURITY POLICY SAFE HARBOR COMPLIANCE AND EU PRIVACY POLICY DIRECTIVE**

Effective Date 1st April, 2014

I. PURPOSE

Moodlerooms has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Moodlerooms’ certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.

II. SCOPE  
This Policy is maintained by Moodlerooms Inc. on behalf of itself, its parent entity and its US and non-US subsidiaries and divisions (collectively, “Moodlerooms”), and applies to all current clients of Moodlerooms.

III. DEFINITIONS  
“Agent” means any third party that processes, collects, or uses Personal Information pursuant to the instructions of, and solely for the benefit of, Moodlerooms, or to which Moodlerooms, Inc. discloses Personal Information for use on its behalf.  
“Personal information”, means information that can directly or indirectly lead to the identification of a living person, such as an individual’s name, e-mail, or other identifying characteristic. Personal information does not include information that has been made anonymous, encoded or otherwise stripped of its identifiers, or information that is publicly available, unless combined with other non-public personal information.

IV. SEVEN PRINCIPALS OF SAFE HARBOR  
1\. NOTICE  
The following is our disclosure of how Moodlerooms, Inc. collects and uses personal information; any third parties to which we may disclose that information; how you can access your information and restrict our use of it; and how to contact us with any questions or complaints about how we use your information.  
Any personal information sent to us by our clients is used exclusively for the purposes and services for which we contracted. We do not share, transmit, rent or sell that information to any other parties.  
We may collect personal information such as name, title, firm, address, e-mail address, and survey results from individuals who have requested information from us or expressed interest in our products and services. You may provide this information to us electronically, over the Internet, or physically. Your personal information will be used by Moodlerooms, Inc., exclusively for the purpose of providing and improving service to you, or informing you of additional products and services which we think will be of interest to you.  
Other information gathered through this site is purely statistical, such as what Web pages are visited most often. This information is useful to Moodlerooms, Inc., and enables us not only to improve and upgrade our services but also to refine our product lines and marketing. This information is anonymous in nature.  
We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, views or activities, social security benefits or information specifying the sex life of the individual or criminal or administrative proceedings) or receive sensitive personal information from any third parties.

2\. CHOICE  
If you request information from us, you will be given the choice at that time to opt out of receiving future communications from us on information, products, or services that may be of interest to you.  
If you have provided us with your personal information in the past, and you do not wish to receive further communications of information, products, or services from us, you can opt out, by sending an email to: unsubscribe@moodlerooms.com.  
If you provide personal information to us as part of a service we provide to you or your organization, we do not share, transmit, rent or sell that information to any third parties except as described herein.

3\. ONWARD TRANSFER  
Moodlerooms only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Moodlerooms in the following limited circumstances:

Where Moodlerooms receives personal information from persons in the EU, Moodlerooms will use and disclose such information only in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally collected or in accordance with notices we might provide to such persons.

We provide personal information to offices, subcontractors or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf or providing the services. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.  
We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Moodlerooms, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

Moodlerooms will provide notice and provide individuals with the opportunity to “opt out” if such personal information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for purposes incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected.

4\. SECURITY  
Moodlerooms employs considerable precautions within the company — including physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards — designed to secure the privacy of all personal information we retain, and protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

Moodlerooms does not require or store any personal information from clients other than email address, name, phone numbers, fax numbers, business address, and contact name.
