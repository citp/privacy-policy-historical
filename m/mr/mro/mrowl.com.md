By using the Service, you consent to the recording, storage, and disclosure of such communications you send or receive for these purposes. 
    * **Information we receive from third-party sites you connect to our Service.** We may receive personal information about you from third parties and combine that with information we collect through our Service. For example, we may obtain information when you log in through a third-party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook or Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information. If you permit the third-party social network to share your friends list or address book with us, we may use this information to let you know what your friends are doing on our Service and to let your friends know what you are doing on the Service. We use this data to provide, enhance, and personalize the Service (e.g., to help connect you with or suggest friends within our Services). If you do not want to provide us with this data, you need to adjust the privacy settings on your social media account. The data we receive from these third-party sites is dependent upon that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service. 
    * **Address Book Information.** With your permission, MrOwl may access your contact list available on your mobile device, social media accounts, and email accounts so that you can locate your friends and contacts on the Service and invite your friends and contacts to connect with our Service.

We will not use the information contained in your Address Book for any purpose other than to send invitations to your contacts at your request. 

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to personalize and curate the Service, communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages and push notifications, and permit you to communicate on the Service or invite others to join the Service.
