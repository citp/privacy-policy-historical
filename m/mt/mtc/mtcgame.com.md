Mobile location services: Certain stores may also collect and use location information from mobile devices. Location information allows us to learn more about how guests use our stores to enhance the guest experience and, in certain circumstances, deliver push notifications and other content to your mobile device when you are near, enter and move through our stores, and send or provide you with offers and promotional information that we believe may be of interest to you.
