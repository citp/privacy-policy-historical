3.1  In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, the Company may collect, use or disclose personal information without knowledge or consent if it is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way.

The Company may also collect, use and disclose personal information without knowledge or consent if:

  * seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information, such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law;

  * disclosure is to a lawyer representing the Company, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or otherwise required or permitted by law.

3.3  Generally, the Company shall seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time it collects the information. However, the Company may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected, but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.

3.4  The Company will require customers to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition of the supply of a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is required to fulfill the identified purposes.

3.5  In determining the appropriate form of consent, the Company shall take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of its customers and employees.

3.6  In general, the use of the Company’s products and services by a customer, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an employee, constitutes implied consent for the Company to collect, use and disclose personal information for all identified purposes.

3.7  A customer or employee may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Customers and employees may contact the Company for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.

#### Principle 5 – Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention of Personal Information

_The Company_ _shall not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law._

The Company shall retain personal information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.

5.1  In certain circumstances, personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. (See Principle 3.1)

5.2  In addition, the Company may disclose a customer’s personal information to

  * another telecommunications company for the efficient and cost-effective provision of telecommunications services;
  * a company involved in supplying the customer with communications or communications directory related services;
  * a company or individual retained by the Company to perform functions on the Company’s behalf, such as research and data processing;
  * another person for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of any of the Company’s products or services;
  * credit grantors and reporting agencies;
  * an agent used by the Company to evaluate a customer’s credit worthiness or to collect the customer’s account;
  * a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in the reasonable judgment of the Company, it appears that there is imminent danger to life or property which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information;
  * a person who, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, is seeking the information as an agent of the customer; and
  * a third party or parties, where the customer consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required or permitted by law.

  * in the context of providing references regarding current or former employees in response to requests from prospective employers; or
  * where disclosure is required or permitted by law.



5.4  Only those Company employees who require access for business reasons, or whose duties reasonably so require are granted access to personal information about customers and employees.

5.5  The Company shall keep personal information only as long as it remains necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law. Depending on the circumstances, where personal information has been used to make a decision about a customer or employee, the Company shall retain, for a period of time that is reasonably sufficient to allow for access by the customer or employee, either the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.

5.6  The Company shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or required by law to be retained. Such information shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.

5.7  When outsourcing certain business or operational functions, the Company strives to minimize the personal information stored or processed outside of Canada. However, in some cases, personal information may be stored or processed outside of Canada to provide customer or employees with service or to support the Company’s operations, and therefore may be subject to the legal jurisdiction of such non-Canadian territory. The Company only provides this information to companies it outsources upon negotiating suitable contracts which stipulate, among other things, that the personal information may only be used for the purposes of providing the services in question.

#### Principle 6 – Accuracy of Personal Information

_The personal information the Company_ _maintains shall be as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used._

6.2  The Company shall update personal information about customers and employees as and when necessary to fulfill the identified purposes or upon notification by the individual.

#### Principle 7 – Security Safeguards

_The Company shall protect personal information through security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information._

The Company shall use care in disposing of or destroying personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information.

7.2  The Company shall protect personal information disclosed to third parties by contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information, the purposes for which it is to be used, limits on the number of Company personnel or agents that access the information to those whose job functions require access to the information, and security measures required to safeguard such personal information.

7.3  All employees of the Company, with access to personal information shall be required as an ongoing condition of employment to respect the confidentiality of personal information.

_The Company_ _shall inform a customer or employee of the existence, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information upon request and shall give the individual access to that information, except in certain circumstances._

9.1  A customer or employee shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.

Upon request, the Company shall afford customers and employees a reasonable opportunity to review the personal information in the individual’s file. Personal information shall be provided in understandable form within a reasonable time and at a minimal or no cost to the individual.

9.2  In certain situations, the Company may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information it holds about a customer or employee. The Company shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request. For example:

  * if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual;
  * if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information;
  * if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege;
  * if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process;
  * if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law; or
  * if the information is prohibitively costly to provide and it is reasonable for the Company to not provide the information on such basis.



9.3  Upon request, the Company shall provide an account of the use and disclosure of personal information and, where reasonably possible, shall state the source of the information. In providing an account of disclosure, the Company shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed personal information about the individual when it is not possible to provide an actual list.

9.4  In order to safeguard personal information, a customer or employee may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit the Company to account for the existence, use and disclosure of personal information and to authorize access to the individual’s file. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.

9.5  The Company shall promptly correct or complete any personal information found to be inaccurate or incomplete.
