As a rule, Mt. SAC will not disclose personal information unless we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. Mt.

When we do collect personal information and if you do not wish your personal information to be shared, you may have the choice of not participating in a particular service or feature where personal information is collected.

Mt. SAC may disclose personal information in special cases when we have reason to believe disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating [Mt. SAC's Standards and Practices](https://web.archive.org/college/iet/web_resources/webteam/web_site_standards.html) or may be causing injury to or interference with Mt. SAC's rights or property, other Mt. SAC users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Mt. SAC may disclose or access personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

Mt. SAC also does not share, rent or sell your personal financial or health-related information. If you use a Mt. SAC email account, [Mt. SAC's Standards and Practices](https://web.archive.org/college/iet/web_resources/webteam/web_site_standards.html) prohibit you from divulging your user ID and password to anyone.
