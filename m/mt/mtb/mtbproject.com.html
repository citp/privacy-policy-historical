<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>MTB PROJECT PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This Privacy
Policy (the "<b>Policy</b>") governs the data that you submit, or
that we collect, in connection with your use of Adventure Projects' website and
any mobile applications or websites that link to or reference this Policy
(collectively, the "<b>Service</b>"). By accessing or using the
Service, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information
as described in this Privacy Policy by Adventure Projects, LLC and any
affiliated corporate entities that are controlled by, or in common control
with, Adventure Projects, LLC ("<b>THE COMPANY</b>"). </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"You"
and "your" refer to you, as a user of the Service. A "user"
is someone who accesses, browses, crawls, scrapes, or in any way uses the
Service. "We", "us", and "our" refer to THE
COMPANY.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>1. INFORMATION
YOU SUBMIT</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>Account
Registration: </span></i><span>You must
provide certain identifying information, such as an authorized Facebook session, to sign up for
an Account on the Service. When you sign up for a THE COMPANY account, we opt
you in to receive emails from and other communications from THE COMPANY by
default. In addition, the Company has a
relationship with the International Mountain Bike Alliance (IMBA) and your email
address may be shared with them.  You can manage your email preferences and modify some of the
information associated with your account by logging in to http://www.mtbproject.com and clicking your name.
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>Public Content:
</span></i><span>Your text, images, photos,
audio, video, location data, and all other forms of data or communication and
other content you post to the Service are meant for public consumption. We may
display this content on the Service, and further distribute it to a wider
audience through third party sites and services.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>2. INFORMATION
WE COLLECT</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In addition to the
information you submit to or through the Service, we also collect and store
information from and about you in the course of your use of the Service. We use
this information to analyze and track user behavior and personalize your
experience. For example:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>Activity</span></i><span>: We may collect and store information
related to you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, IP
address, unique device identifier, geo-location, requested URL, referring URL,
browser language, the pages you view, and the date and time of your visit.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>Cookies</span></i><span>: We may use cookies, web beacons, local
shared objects, and similar technology in connection with your use of the Service
("Cookies"). Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among
other places, on your computer, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages.
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>3. THIRD
PARTIES</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>We do not rent,
share, sell or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for
their direct marketing purposes. That said, we work with third parties and they
may have access to some of your information:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>Advertising</span></i><span>: We allow third parties who provide
advertising services to use Cookies, as defined above, in connection with your
use of the Service. As a result, they may collect and store the same type of
information and use it for the same type of purposes as described for THE
COMPANY Cookies above, and they may be able to associate the information they
collect with other information they may have about you.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>Service
Providers</span></i><span>: We may outsource
some of our technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions,
quality assurance testing, and other services to third parties. We may share
information from or about you with them so that they can perform their
services.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>Business
Transfers</span></i><span>: We may share
information from or about you with subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies
under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy
Policy. If another company acquires THE COMPANY or all or substantially all of
our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the
rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this
Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>4. CONTROLLING
YOUR PERSONAL DATA</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Other users may be
able to identify you, or associate you with your user account if you include
personal information in your Public Content. You can reduce the risk of being
personally identified by using the Service pseudonymously, though doing so
could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Service. </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>5. DATA
RETENTION AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>If you terminate
your account, we will remove your name and email address from our public
servers but <b>will not remove or delete any Public Content from the Service</b>
even though we may make such contribution anonymous. &nbsp;Please note that
information may exist in backup storage even after it has been removed from our
active databases. You can request that your account be terminated by contacting us at
http://www.adventureprojectsllc.com . </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>6. CHILDREN</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Service is
intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do
not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without
parental consent, please contact us at http://www.adventureprojectsllc.com .
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>7. SECURITY</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>We follow
generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of
transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage,
is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means
to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>8. MODIFICATIONS
TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</span></b></p>

<p><span>We may revise this
Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy
Policy will govern our use of your information. If we make material changes to
this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on the Service
prior to the effective date of the changes. By continuing to access or use the Service
after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This Privacy Policy was Last Updated on March 5, 2013.</span></p>
