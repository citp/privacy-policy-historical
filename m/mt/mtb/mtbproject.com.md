Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.

We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information.

**ADVERTISING**

We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Site, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns.

Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. These third parties may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. Their use of cookies and other technologies, and the information they collect, are governed by their own privacy policies, not this one. We may provide these third-parties with information about your usage of our Site and our services.
