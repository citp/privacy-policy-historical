    * MTN uses your information to better understand your needs and to provide you with better service.
    * Specifically, MTN will use your personal information to contact you in relation to the goods and services that MTN provides to you.
    * MTN reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure interest in and use the various areas of the website, so long as such statistical analyses will not be linked to any registered person by a third party.
    * Because we don't want you to miss out on any of the deals and promotions that we may have and if it is agreeable to you when you register with us or at any other time, we may use your personal information to contact you for market research.
    * MTN may send you promotional materials or details by SMS, e-mail or post in order to update you and keep you advised of any promotions, news, competitions or developments which we think may be of interest to you.
