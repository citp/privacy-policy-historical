# MTGPrice.com Privacy Policy

### 1\. Introduction

Thanks for choosing MTGPrice. To provide you with the MTGPrice Service (or “Service”, both as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use), Quantitative Methods, Inc. dba MTGPrice (“MTGPrice”, “we”, “us”, “our”) needs to collect some information about you, and this Privacy Policy is where we describe the information we collect, what we do with it, and how you can manage and control the use of your information. By using or interacting with the Service, you are entering into a binding contract with us and consenting to the use of your information as explained in this Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree with these terms, then please don’t use the Service.

You may integrate your MTGPrice account with third party services besides Google (“Other Integrated Services”). If you do, we may receive, use and share the categories of information described above, including information made publically available on or through your account of such Other Integrated Service, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.   


**2.4** Payment data:  


When you sign up for a Trial or any of our Paid Subscriptions (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use), or make other purchases through the Service, your credit card information and other financial data that we need to process your payment are collected and stored by third party payment processors, and we may collect some limited information, such as your postal code and details of your transaction history. These third parties generally provide us with some limited information related to you, such as a unique token that enables you to make additional purchases using the information they’ve stored, and your card’s type, expiration date, and last four digits.   


**2.5** Cookies & similar technologies:  


A cookie is a small text file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us or our business partners to recognize your device when you return to the Service. We may use cookies to perform functions essential to the operation of the Service, track site usage and trends, provide advertising on the Service, and improve and customize your MTGPrice experience. We may also allow certain business partners to place or recognize cookies for those purposes. Learn more about how we use cookies and other similar standard Internet technologies at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.

### 3\. How we use the information we collect:

### 4\. How we share the information we collect:

We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, as follows:

 **4.1** Sharing with Google and other services:  


If you connect to MTGPrice using Google or otherwise connect your MTGPrice account to an Other Integrated Service, the default setting is generally that MTGPrice automatically shares your activity and activity-related stories with that service. You understand that such information may be attributed to your account on Google or the Other Integrated Service and may be published on such service. See section 5 below to learn how you can disable sharing of information on Google and Other Integrated Services. You understand and agree that Google’s or other third parties’ use of information they collect from you is governed by their privacy policies, and MTGprice’s use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy.   


**4.2** Sharing with Third Party Applications:  


To personalize your experience, we may share some information we have collected about you with providers of Third Party Applications, such as high-level geographic information, your musical preferences, settings and technical data. However, we take precautions to prohibit Third Party Application providers from attempting to identify you by using the information we provide to them or by collecting additional information without your consent. Please note that if you: actively choose to provide Third Party Applications with additional information, such as by visiting a Third Party Application (which enables collection of your IP address) or allowing us to share precise geographic data which Third Party Application providers request from us; or consent to collection of additional information about you by a Third Party Application provider when you for example register with or log in to the Third Party Application, the Third Party Application may be able to identify you and associate the information previously provided by MTGPrice with you. You agree and understand that a Third Party Application provider’s privacy policy governs its use of your information that we provide to it or that it collects from you.   


**4.3** Service providers and others:  


We may from time to time engage other companies in the MTGPrice group and third party service providers to perform functions and process user data, consistent with section 3 above. Third party service providers’ processing of user data will always be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.   


**4.4** Other sharing:  


In addition to the above, we may also share your information to third parties for these limited purposes: to allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets; to respond to legal process (e.g. a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so; to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the rights and property of MTGprice, including to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use and Mobile Terms; and to address fraud, security or technical issues; to inform business partners about use of the Service and products and services made available through the Service, in the form of aggregated statistics or otherwise in a format which does not reveal your identity; if you expressly opt in to such sharing. You agree and understand that the privacy policies of the third parties will govern all use of information that we provide to it or that it collects from you.

### 5\. Links

We may display advertisements from third parties and other content which links to third party websites. We cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content. Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal information.

### 6\. Security

We are committed to protecting our users’ information. Your password protects your user account, so you should use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and sign off after having used the MTGPrice Service. While we take reasonable data protection precautions, no security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information at any time.

### 7\. Children

For users in the United States, the MTGPrice Service is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, do not use the Service and do not provide any personal information to us. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it.

### 8\. Accessing and updating user information
