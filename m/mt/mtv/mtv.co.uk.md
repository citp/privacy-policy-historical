You should therefore exercise caution when disclosing information in your profile or elsewhere on any of our communities. 

 

You can decide how much of your information is automatically displayed in your public profile as follows: 

 

·         You can hide certain of elements of your member profile information by revising the member privacy settings found in the “Privacy” page of the “Profile” area (found by clicking on the “Profile” tab and then the “Edit Profile” tab and then “Privacy”). IMPORTANT NOTE: Even if you set your member profile to private your thumbnail picture, display name, general location, and gender may still appear publicly: (i) as a search result if another Member conducts a search of other SP Network communities using matching criteria, such as location, gender, age criteria, etc.; and (ii) on other SP Network communities that display featured thumbnails, for example, pages showing most active members, recent members, most popular members, etc  

·         You can choose to completely hide from public view posts to your member profile blog

 

·         You can delete comments posted to another community member’s page. 

Please refer to our [_Website Terms of Use_](https://web.archive.org/terms/website) for restrictions with respect to public postings. We reserve the right (in our sole discretion) to set certain limits on the availability of some or all features within our communities.
