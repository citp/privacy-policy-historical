This Privacy Policy discloses our information and privacy practices with regard to the Web Site, such as the types of information we may gather from you and how we may use and share that information. Except if specifically stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Web Site and does not apply to information collected offline or otherwise outside of the Web Site.    


Please take a moment to review the terms of this Privacy Policy. By using the Web Site, you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Web Site.  Please also review the [Terms of Use,](https://web.archive.org/termsofuse/Pages/default.aspx) which governs your use of the Web Site.  Please note that certain features or services discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Web Site at any particular time.

TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED

This Web Site is primarily informational, but we may, on occasion, ask you to provide us your name, e-mail address and other contact information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (“PII”). We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Site, including when you register for e-mail communications, when you submit information needed to consider you for potential employment opportunities, or when you submit a question or request to the Web Site. We may also collect certain demographic information (such as gender, age or ethnicity) and information about your interests and preferences (collectively, “Demographic Information”).

We retain and use your PII and Demographic Information in order to: (i) send you e-mail communications that you have agreed to receive; (ii) facilitate your job search and prepare governmental and internal statistics reports; (iii) respond to your questions or other requests; (iv) contact you with regard to your use of the Web Site or changes to the Web Site’s Privacy Policy, Terms of Use or other Web Site policies; or (v) for other purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information. We may also use the information you provide to improve the Web Site and its content, features and services; customize your experience on the Web Site; or for other internal business purposes.  We may occasionally receive information about you from third parties. If we combine that information with information we collect through the Web Site, we will apply this Privacy Policy to such information. 

Please note that information submitted to the Web Site via a “contact us” or other similar mechanism will not necessarily receive a response.

The Web Site is a general audience web site. We do not knowingly collect any PII from children under the age of thirteen (13) on the Web Site and we will delete any information later determined to be from a user younger than thirteen (13). 

When you visit this Web Site, our servers automatically collect certain web site usage information.  Web site usage information is non-personally identifiable information about how our visitors use and navigate the Web Site, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their stays, the type of browser each visitor is using (for example, Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system each visitor is using, (for example, Windows 2000 or Mac OS), the domain name of each visitor’s Internet service provider (for example, America Online, Earthlink) and certain other information (for example, IP address and clickstream data). An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, which our web servers use to identify where to send the information your computer requests.  When you request pages from the Web Site, our servers log your IP address.  We may associate your IP address with the PII you provide to the Web Site. We may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit use of this Web Site.   

Cookies

Web Beacons and Similar Technologies

Our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "web bug" or "clear gif", and which allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain limited information about the viewer of the web page or e-mail message (such as the type of browser downloading the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed, as well as the URL of the page the web beacon comes from). Web beacons are typically very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel) and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail message, including an advertisement or HTML content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, such as and without limitation, to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate this Web Site, and we may include web beacons or similar technologies in e-mails in order to count how many e-mails (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually opened.
