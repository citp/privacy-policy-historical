Cookies may be disabled by adjusting the setting of your browser, or by installing tools like Google’s [ Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout), but this may impede the full functionality of the website making the user experience less engaging.

Some Mount Holyoke-owned and -affiliated websites use Google Analytics and other tools to track data such as IP address, language, geo-location, browser type, and operating system, among other things. Google Analytics is a web-analytics tool that also keeps track of website activity and users’ browsing habits such as duration of time spent on the site.

We do not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address, in order for you to use our website.

All information is collected solely for the College’s internal use. We use it to track and evaluate traffic trends so that we can continually improve the quality our website. We also might use this information to inform you of changes to MHC-owned and -affiliated websites or to provide you with other news and information about the site that we believe may be of interest to you.

User information is neither shared nor sold to unaffiliated third parties for commercial use unless 1) you give us express consent; or 2) we are required to disclose it in compliance with state or federal laws.
