      <p><font face="Tahoma,arial,helvetica" size="2">At some MTI sites, you may

      number, credit card information, type and size of organization, and 
      information about your proposed performances, such as audience size, dates 
      and ticket prices. We may also ask about your interests in and use of 
      various products, programs, and services. You will know when personally 
      identifiable information is collected by MTI because you will have to fill 
      out a form. Of course, if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're 
      still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our 
      sites.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma,arial,helvetica" size="2">We also may collect 
      certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our 
      web pages such as the type of browser you are using (such as Netscape or 
      Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (such as

      <p><font face="Tahoma,arial,helvetica" size="2">We do not knowingly 
      collect any personally identifiable information from any user under the 
      age of 13, nor do we require disclosure of any information from any user 
      beyond that which may reasonably necessary for participation in a 
      particular activity on our Sites. E-mail addresses, first names, grade in 
      school or ages may be obtained from postings on bulletin boards and other 
      exchanges, but we will not maintain such information or use it for 
      marketing purposes. If a contest is run for our users under age 13 and we 
      must notify a winning contestant, or if we offer any products for sale to 
      children, we will require the verified permission of a parent or guardian 
      at the time of submission of any personally identifiable information on a 
      form for that minor user. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma,arial,helvetica" size="2">MTI is under no obligation

      you do not know. While MTI strives to protect your personal information 
      and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you 
      disclose publicly online; you make such disclosures at your own risk. When 
      participating in any user-generated content area, never assume that people 
      are who they say they are, know what they say they know, or are affiliated 
      with whom they say they are affiliated. We cannot be responsible for the
