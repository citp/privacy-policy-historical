If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact).

If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

## 5\. Lawful bases on which we will use your Personal Data

  * on the basis of our legitimate interests as a business that provides you with services or products or on the basis of the legitimate interests of a third-party recipient of your Personal Data, where such interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of Personal Data, or
  * if processing is necessary for us to perform any contract with you (for example to provide you with a service that you have contracted to receive)



In some cases the lawful basis for which we hold and process your Personal Data will be:

  * if you have given your express consent for the processing of your Personal Data, processing that Personal Data for the purpose for which you gave your consent which you can withdraw at any time – see below
  * if processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations (e.g. to keep records for tax or regulatory purposes)

## 6\. Disclosures of your Personal Data

We may have to share your Personal Data with other parties in certain circumstances.

  * We share your Personal Data with IT companies and other third party service providers that provide services or support for our Website and other business systems, with our professional advisers where it is reasonably necessary to obtain advice or services relating to the operation of our business; and in these circumstances FX Blue will retain control over and will remain responsible for your Personal Data and will use appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law to ensure the integrity and security of your Personal Data

We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

## 7\. International transfers

We may transfer your Personal Data to third parties outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Where we do so we will only transfer your Personal Data to third parties outside the EEA if that third party (a) is situated in a country that has been confirmed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection to personal information, or (b) has agreed (by way of written contract) to provide all protections to your Personal Data as required by applicable data protection legislation, or (c) if the transfer is otherwise permitted by law.

We may store your Personal Data on servers operated by third party cloud based service providers such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud and others, some of which are located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your Personal Data may involve a transfer of Personal Data outside the EEA.

Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data out of the EEA.

## 8\. Data security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## 9\. Data retention

### How long will you use my Personal Data for?

We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see "request erasure" below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 10\. Your legal rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Data. You have the right to:

  *  **Request access** to your Personal Data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  *  **Request correction** of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
  *  **Request erasure** of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 
  * **Object to processing** of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
  *  **Request restriction of processing** of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 
  * **Request the transfer** of your Personal Data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 
  * **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.



### No fee usually required

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

### What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

### Time limit to respond

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated

## 11\. Status of this Privacy Notice and Changes

This Privacy Notice was updated in May 2018. It is non-contractual and we reserve the right to amend it from time to time to take account of changes in law, including Britain leaving the European Union and changes in our business practices and Personal Data processing activities. Any updates made to this Notice will appear on our website at www.fxblue.com
