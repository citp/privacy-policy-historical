<br>
<i><font size="2" face="Arial">Please read this privacy policy carefully.  Your use of the MIZUNO USA Web site constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy(the "Mizuno USA Privacy Policy") and consent to the terms herein.  Please see the section labeled "Information We Collect and How We Use It" to learn more about our collection and use of user information.</font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Introduction</font></b><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Mizuno USA, Inc. ("Mizuno USA," or "we," as appropriate)  is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our Web site www.mizunousa.com (the "Site") and users of the other services available through our Site (the "Service(s)").  We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you provide us remains private and is used only for the purposes set forth herein.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">The Mizuno USA Privacy Policy details our commitment to protect your information and the limited manner in which we will use that information to provide and improve our provision of the Services. </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy</font></b><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">	Throughout the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy we use several specialized terms.  "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, credit card number and expiration date.  "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer.  We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users.   Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.</font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">  </font><br>
<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Information We Collect and How We Use It</font></b><br>
<br>
<i><font size="2" face="Arial">If you visit our site to browse</font></i><font size="2" face="Arial">.  We will only collect and store the domain name and host from which a user accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of the user's computer, the user's browser software and operating system, the date and time the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which the user linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting our site.  We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections of our sites, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our visitors link from the sites and to help us make our sites more useful.  For example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics.  This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties, such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing and commercial purposes.  When we share such information with third parties we will require them to abide by the standards of the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy.  Mizuno USA is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site.  We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from that disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</font><br>
<br>
<i><font size="2" face="Arial">If you register, send us a communication or engage in a transaction while at our Site</font></i><font size="2" face="Arial">.  If you communicate with us, we collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through this process, including If applicable) your user ID and password, which we may elect to provide for you.  If you engage in a transaction while logged on to our Site, then we collect and store information about the transaction.  If you send us communications, then we may collect such communications in a file specific to you.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">We use the information we collect from you as a registered user to build features that we hope will make the Services more attractive and easier for you to use.  This may include better customer support and timely notice of new services.  We may share User Information with our partners, affiliates and joint venturers that are committed to serving your need for the Services and improving your user experience, but will require such third parties to abide by the standards of the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy.  We may also share aggregate anonymized data relating to activity on the Site and use of the Services, such as demographical and statistical information, for marketing, research and other purposes.  Furthermore, we may need to disclose User Information to law enforcement or other government officials if appropriate for your protection or in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or our users to legal liability.  From time to time, our Site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this Site.</font><br>
