# Privacy | Mizoram Express

[](http://mizoramexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/terms-of-usage1.jpg)Welcome to Mizoram Express! We appreciate your participation as citizen journalist and visitor. Our goal is to encourage writers in English from all Mizo tribes and concerned citizens to bring to light the good, the bad and the ugly from all aspects of governance to societal practices. However, in order to maintain a civil community, we require you to follow the following basic guidelines:

**Right to Delete Posts**

While we do not and cannot review every message posted by you you must agree that you are responsible for the content of your news item, comments and views. We reserve the right to delete, move or edit messages that we deem abusive, defamatory, obscene, in violation of copyright or trademark laws, or otherwise unacceptable. All posts in the ‘ME Citizen Journalist’ Section must be written in English. We reserve the right to remove the posting privileges of users who violate the standards of ME Citizen Journalist Section’s behavior at any time.
