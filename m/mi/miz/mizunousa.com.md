# Privacy Policy | Mizuno USA

_Please read this privacy policy carefully. Your use of the MIZUNO USA Web site constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy (the "Mizuno USA Privacy Policy") and consent to the terms herein. Please see the section labeled “Information We Collect and How We Use It” to learn more about our collection and use of user information._

**Introduction**  
Mizuno USA, Inc. ("Mizuno USA," or "we," as appropriate) is committed to commercially reasonable measures aimed at safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our Web site [www.mizunousa.com](http://www.mizunousa.com/ "www.mizunousa.com") (the “Site”) and users of the other services available through our Site (the “Service(s)”). We will only use the information you provide us for the purposes set forth herein.

**Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy**  
Throughout the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy we use several certain defined terms. “Personally Identifiable Information” is information that can be used to determine specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, credit card number and expiration date. “User Information” means all Personally Identifiable Information or any other forms of information discussed in the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user’s computer. We use the term “aggregate” when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be “anonymized” if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**  
If you visit our site to browse, we will only intentionally collect and store the domain name and host from which a user accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of the user’s computer, the user’s browser software and operating system, the date and time the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which the user linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections of our sites, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our visitors link from the sites or to help us make our sites more useful. For example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties, such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing and commercial purposes.  If you register, send us a communication or engage in a transaction while at our Site, we may collect or store certain User Information, including your user ID and password (if applicable) and we may also collect the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through this process (We encourage you NOT to include Personally Identifiable Information in your user ID or password).  If you engage in a transaction while logged on to our Site, then we may collect or store information about the transaction. If you send us communications, then we may collect or store such communications in a file specific to you.

We use the information we collect from you to assist us in completing transactions with you, build features that we hope will make the Services more attractive and easier for you to use, provide better customer support or provide timely notice of new services. We may also share aggregate anonymized data relating to activity on the Site and use of the Services, such as demographical and statistical information, for marketing, research and other purposes. Furthermore, we may need to disclose User Information in response to legal processes initiating in civil proceedings or by  law enforcement or other government officials if appropriate under the law, and there is nothing in this Policy that should be construed as a limitation on our ability to respond to valid legal process . From time to time, our Site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests, as with regard to use of any other aspect of this Site, is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information.

**Collection and Use of Personal Information for Local Product Search**
