# Mizozo - Privacy Policy

It is important for everyone to realize that we at Mizozo do not believe in Privacy. We expect people to stand behind what they say, not merely post anonymously. We have no intention of making known who is who, but if ever placed behind the barrel we will not hesitate to identify IP addresses and what we know about an individual. If Privacy is a concern of yours, a little online research would help secure your privacy. If we don’t know who you are, we will not try and find out. We will simply identify what we know and leave it at that. We believe that it is the job of the end user to protect their private lives and not ours. Everything you provide us, outside of your email address, will be considered public information. If you do not wish it to be public, keep it to yourself.

The following is a break down of what we plan on storing and how that information is to be used. 

**Your Information** \- When you register, we will require your First Name, Last Name and Email address. Aside from the Email, the First and Last name will be taken on trust and never checked. Your First and Last name will be public on your profile page, but your email address will never be shared … ever. The remaining information you provide to us via registration will also be made public on your profile, so if you don’t want someone to know something, keep it to yourself.

**Automatic Information about You** \- As you use the site, information about you will be collected. This information is generally considered Traffic Data and includes, but is not limited to, the following: IP Address, Browser, Pages Requested, where you came from, and so on. For now, this is so that we can properly adjust Mizozo’s settings to fit to our user base. In the future, we plan to use it to properly market advertisements to our users. 

**Email** \- Your email address is safe. This has little to do with Privacy, but more so to do with our means of communication with you outside of Mizozo. We have absolutely no intention of ever making email addresses public and will always provide an easy way to remove your email address from any mass mailings or other mailers that we send out.

**Password** \- I can’t stress enough how important passwords are to a user. All of our passwords are encrypted one way and can never be retrieved. If you forget it your only hope is to reset it. If you make a password that is easy to guess, this is entirely your fault. Be smart, use complicated passwords. This isn’t only for Mizozo, but always. Always remember to log off from Mizozo when you are away so nobody can access your account and post things against your will. 

**Cookies** \- Like all interactive sites, Mizozo uses cookies. If you don’t know what a cookie is, Google is your friend. Otherwise, it is important to know what we place in our cookies. If you click the “remember me” checkbox upon logging in, we place that info in a cookie. Likewise, we use cookies to store where you have been on our site. Currently, this is the only thing we use cookies for, but keep in mind that some of our advertisers may use cookies, which we have absolutely no control over. If you are opposed to us, or anyone else for that matter, to use cookies, simply disable them in your browser. 

**Children** \- Law states that users must be 13 in order to access the site. While there is absolutely no way we can block the public information that we provide, we can revoke registration if a complaint is filed that a user registered who is less than 13 years old. Since there is little we can do to verify age, this will be handled on a case by case basis. Parents, if your child is using the site and you would like them removed, I highly recommend blocking the site altogether. Otherwise, send us a message and we will work it out.

**Conditions of Use** \- If you are using Mizozo it is assumed that you have agreed to our privacy policy. If you do not agree, don’t use the site.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy** \- This policy may change at any time with absolutely no warning. It is your responsibility to stay informed on our privacy policy. If you have enabled us to email you system messages, we will alert you when such a change occurs. Otherwise, you agree to keep up to date with our policy yourself.

This policy is effective as of January 1st, 2012.
