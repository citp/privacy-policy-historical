This information includes duration and quantity of page visits, downloads, specific product searches and needs and/or such information that a service such as Google Analytics would capture. See <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">www.google.com/analytics</a>. Personal data that you convey to us via our Site is collected, stored, used and processed by or on behalf of Miele.<br>
<br>
We also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser.<br>

&nbsp;</p>

<p><a id="3" name="test">3. </a>&nbsp;<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure&nbsp;</strong><br>
We may disclose aggregated information (that is, information which does not contain personally identifiable data of any individual user) about our users without restriction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>

<p>Our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Alphabet, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users navigate the website. See <a href="#test">III. Information Sharing and Disclosure</a>&nbsp;The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. More information about the technology used by Google is available at <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">www.google.com/analytics</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <strong>Cookies&nbsp;</strong><br>
Cookies are small text files that a web site can send to a user's browser for storage on the hard drive. Cookies can make use of the web easier by saving status and preferences about a web site. Generally, websites use cookies to:</p>

<ul>
	<li type="A">Remind site owners who users are and to access user information in order to deliver a more personalized service, and</li>
	<li type="A">Estimate audience size.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each browser accessing such a site is given a unique cookie. Information collected by those cookies is sometimes called "click stream" or "click trail" and may also describe pages seen by the user and track user patterns, preferences and length of stay on a particular page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <strong>IP Addresses&nbsp;</strong><br>
When a web browser requests a web page or e-mail from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This is called an Internet Protocol Address ("IP Address"). We collect IP Addresses through the Site. These IP Addresses may be used for various purposes, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li type="A">Diagnose service or technology problems that are associated with the IP Addresses;</li>
	<li type="A">Estimate the number of users visiting the Site;</li>
	<li type="A">Send the most appropriate marketing, advertising or services information; or</li>
	<li type="A">Assist companies or persons who provide information in our service to track visits to their pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <strong>Links To Other Sites</strong>&nbsp;<br>
We may provide&nbsp;links to external sites (provided by third parties)&nbsp;as a convenience to you. When you click on any such link, you will leave the Site. We have not necessarily reviewed or approved the information on those other sites and will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy or completeness of the content of those or any other sites or any products or services that may be offered through those or any other sites. Should you rely upon that content, or otherwise use it in any way, you do so at your own risk. The inclusion of any such link does not imply Miele's endorsement of the owner or operator of the external site, the external site itself, or the products or services that the external site describes, promotes or sells. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external sites. Our privacy policy does not apply to any external site. Miele will not be responsible for any losses, damages or other liabilities incurred as a result of your use of any linked sites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <strong>Security and Integrity of Information / Warranties</strong><br>
The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us, and we treat our data as assets that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ reasonable and customary information-security techniques, but no security system is capable of meeting all anticipated or unanticipated security needs.</p>

<p>You understand that we cannot and do not warrant that files available for downloading from the internet or the Site will be free of viruses or other destructive code or the like. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our Site for any reconstruction of any lost data.</p>

<p>YOUR USE OF THIS SITE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.&nbsp; MIELE DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT ITS SECURITY SYSTEMS WILL BE FOOLPROOF OR ABLE TO FULFILL ANY ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, OR THAT YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WILL BE PROTECTED AGAINST LOSS, MISUSE OR ALTERATION BY THIRD PARTIES.</p>

<p>9. <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
