# mininova : FAQ

Sponsored links:  


Mininova is the biggest torrent search engine and directory. We started in January 2005 as an alternative to the (at that time very popular) [SuprNova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprnova), which went offline at the end of 2004 due to legal issues.  
Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use directory and search engine for all kind of torrent files. Visitors of mininova can anonymously upload torrents to this site, tracked by any BitTorrent tracker. Scrape data (amount of seeds/peers) is collected every hour. Note that we try to keep mininova family-safe, so adult submissions are not allowed. 

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer (or P2P) [protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_%28computing%29) used for the distribution of large files.

You can contact the administrators of this site at [staff@mininova.org](mailto:staff@mininova.org). Suggestions, ideas and fixes are always welcome. Note that we cannot help you with problems regarding your downloaded files. Please visit [our forum](http://forum.mininova.org/) or [IRC channel](https://web.archive.org/irc/) and ask advise from our great community. 

Please note that we do not host any illegal content on this site. The torrent (metadata) files do not contain data that might be copyrighted in any way.  
However, we offer a service to remove torrents from our site if the copyright holder of the software requests so. These removal requests are only valid if: 

  * You are, or your company is, the copyright holder of this software ( **no** generic anti-piracy groups).
  * You provide the **exact** links to the torrents, **no** complete (sub)categories or search queries.
  * You provide the complete name(s) of the content in question.
  * You provide **complete** contact information (including the name and phone number of the contact person), **not** a general anti-piracy mail address.



If your request complies with **all** of these rules, send a mail to [copyright@mininova.org](mailto:copyright@mininova.org). Please keep the correspondence polite.  
We remove postings as soon as we can, usually within 24 hours. Keep in mind that mails not applying to the above rules will be ignored. 

This is a small metadata file. Metadata here means that the file contains information about the data you want to download, not the data itself.  
Your BitTorrent client needs the .torrent file to connect to the tracker (see below) and download the data you want.

A seed is a client that has a complete copy of the data of a certain torrent. Once your BitTorrent client finishes downloading, it will remain open until you click the Finish button (or otherwise close it). This is known as being a seed or seeding.

A leecher is a client that is currently downloading a torrent. Generally a leecher does not have the complete file, otherwise it would be called a seed.

A server on the internet that acts to coordinate the actions of BitTorrent clients. When you open a torrent, your machine contacts the tracker and asks for a list of seeds and peers to connect to.

A private tracker is a tracker which requires registration before you can use this service. Such trackers usually have a high amount of seeds, because users get banned if their ratio is too low.

Torrents with this icon next to their name have a [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/) or [Gamez](http://games.gamez.com/) number specified. This means that you can easily search for other releases with the same content. This also makes it easier to find the product website or get more information about the movie/game.

These files are so-called RAR archives. You need to install WinRAR to extract the data of the files. WinRAR can be downloaded from [this site](http://www.rarlabs.com/). 

The password is most likely the URL that's in the name of the torrent (posibly even with [] if it's for example "Test torrent [www.test.com]"). If that is not the case try the URL of the tracker (see the details page of the torrent). If that isn't the password try to go to the tracker URL (without the scrape part!) and look for a password there. You can also take a look in our [forum](http://forum.mininova.org/), where many passwords are posted.

We offer an RSS feed to stay up-to-date with this site. You need an RSS reader to use this. In Mozilla Firefox, just click the RSS icon in the bottom right corner of your browser window. In Opera the newsfeeds will automatically be subscribed when you click [this](http://www.mininova.org/rss.xml) link, the feed will show up under "Newsfeeds" at the bottom of your "Mail" panel. Users with other browsers have to download a RSS reader, you can find a list [here](http://blogspace.com/rss/readers). The feed URL is [**http://www.mininova.org/rss.xml**](http://www.mininova.org/rss.xml)

It's very easy, the URL scheme is as following: 

http://www.mininova.org/rss.xml?cat=5&num=50

Where "5" is the category number and "50" is the number of results you want. Leaving out "cat" means all categories. Instead of "cat" you can also use "sub" with a subcategory number. The default "num" is 20. In the example above, 50 results are shown for the category "Music".

Yes, please take a look at our [dedicated Firefox page](https://web.archive.org/firefox.php) for plugins and extensions.

Azureus magnet links are a new way of linking torrent files. Instead of downloading the torrent from a webserver, you get it directly from a seeder/leecher. The biggest advantage is that you might be able to download the content of the torrent, even if the tracker is down or closed for registration. You need the latest version of the [Azureus client](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/) with DHT enabled (open your UDP port) to use this feature. 

To protect the privacy of our visitors, we do not log IP adrresses or hostnames of our visitors. However, we may log some IP addresses of uploaders for administrational purposes (e.g., banning people who upload spam torrents several times). Remember that all torrent submissions are anonymous, no login is required for uploading. We will not distribute IP addresses or other information of visitors of this site to third parties.

Mininova is entirely written by us (the admins) in PHP. It doesn't use any template or other system because they are all too slow. Mininova is running on 1 webserver and 2 database servers (plus an additional server for the forums/blog/advertisements). We use [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/) as webserver because with a lot of hits it's just faster than Apache (which we used to run on). Mininova makes heavy use of [eAccelerator](http://eaccelerator.net/) to cache compiled PHP scripts. eAccelerator is also used to cache blocks of HTML which are generated using information from the database that doesn't change very often or which are requested very often. For example the [frontpage](https://web.archive.org/) is cached for 5 minutes. Some other caching times can be found on the [stats page](http://www.mininova.org/stats/misc/). For our database we use [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) because it's free and fast.  
If you have any questions or want to know more about the technical details just mail to [staff@mininova.org](mailto:staff@mininova.org).
