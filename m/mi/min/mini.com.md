#### Personal Information Defined

Personal information is information that distinctively refers to you, such as your name, address, birth date, gender, marital status, financial information etc. Keep in mind that if you identify yourself as an employee of an organization, your name, title, business address or business telephone number would not be considered personal information.   
We collect, use and disclose personal information supplied by you for yourself and for our respective related companies and business partners (lists available on request) in order (a) to provide you with products (vehicles, parts, accessories, etc.), (b) to perform services (including Warranty, owner notifications, service reminders, etc.), (c) to improve our products and services, (d) to initiate, maintain and develop our relationship with you (including product and service information, offers, etc.), (e) to administer billing, accounting and security measures in relation to your business with us and (f) to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

#### Collection of Personal Information

Within our website, you may be asked to provide personal information about yourself. MINI Canada will collect personal information only when you voluntarily provide it. Be assured that the personal information you provide remains strictly confidential and will be used or disclosed only for the purposes for which it was collected and will not be used or disclosed for any other reason unless you have given us consent to do so.   
We collect personal information for registration on our mailing list, for eligibility to participate in a contest, survey or promotion, or simply for informing you of upcoming events or special offers. In other areas of our website, personal information is requested in order to apply for credit in respect to a lease or finance, to register for a BMW Driver Training course or to obtain information related to pre-owned products. The personal information you provide will only be collected and used for the purposes that have been identified. In certain parts of this website where we require that you provide us with personal information such as credit card information, we will protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using industry standard encryption technology.   
We do, however, discourage you from sending any sensitive personal information (that is, credit card information) via regular email and limit such disclosure to the secure area within the website where it may be specifically requested.   
MINI Canada will not knowingly encourage children under the age of 13 to register at its website.

#### Access To Your Personal Information

There may be reasonable costs associated with your request. Please direct your request to the Privacy Officer as noted above.

#### Retention of Personal Information

MINI Canada will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws.

#### Use of Facebook Social Plugins

One of the features of the Site is that a user has the ability to engage with social plugins (“plugins”) from the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").   
When you access the Facebook social plugin through our Site, your browser establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin (e.g. a “Like” button) is transferred by Facebook directly to your browser, which then integrates it into our Site. The data that your browser sends to Facebook includes your user ID, the website you're visiting, the date and time, and other browser-related information. If you are logged out of Facebook, Facebook does not receive your user ID. You can find more information about Facebook’s privacy practices at <http://www.facebook.com/policy.php>.

#### Customer Option To "Opt-Out"

You may decide that you would prefer that we do not use or disclose your personal information for MINI related marketing purposes or as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy (excepting legal and/or contractual obligations), in particular, for some or all of the following:   
− MINI Canada Special Events and Promotions that may include notification of comparison drive events, information for golf, tennis or ski events, new car launches, brochures, etc.  
− MINI Retailer Promotions that may include retailer event information, service clinics, etc.  
− MINI Magazine Package  
− Satisfaction Surveys such as product and/or service surveys, J.D. Power, etc.

However, if you wish to "opt-out", you may do so at any time by contacting us. Please see above for contact information. Be assured that your decision to "opt-out" will not affect your business relationship with us.

#### Collection of Non-Identifiable Information

In order to allow you easy and convenient access to our websites, certain non-identifiable information is collected, as described below. We may share this information with our website providers to allow us to continually improve our websites.

#### Site Traffic Monitoring

During each and every visit to one of our websites, we will collect non-identifiable information by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses on an aggregate basis. IP addresses do not track personal information about you. They simply allow us to monitor how our sites are being used and what information is being accessed. MINI Canada will use this information to ensure its websites remain useful and convenient, in order to meet and satisfy your needs.

#### "Cookies"

When a user interacts with our website, "session-cookies" are used to collect information anonymously and to track user patterns. They do not permanently record data and are only available during an active session, therefore, once a session is terminated, the "session-cookie" disappears. A session cookie is a small text file which contains a unique identification number that identifies your browser, not you personally, to our computer each time you visit our website. A session cookie can tell us which pages were visited and how often. We use this anonymous information in an effort to improve our website's usefulness to you - primarily for technical reasons, such as providing seamless navigation. If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept them altogether. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on our websites such as personalization features.

We have implemented security measures which include the use of: physical secure data centres and premises; internal security policies and procedures; defined internal segregation of duties; and electronic access controls such as passwords and encryption technology.

In addition, we encourage you to observe safe computing practices. It is your responsibility to keep confidential the user-ID and password that you use to register with us and not share them with anyone. If you believe that your user-ID and password have been compromised, you can change them by editing your profile at our website www.bmw.ca or by contacting MINI Canada as noted above in "Correcting or Updating Personal Information".
