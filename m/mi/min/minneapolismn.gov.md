The City Of Minneapolis Privacy Statement discloses the information gathering practices of the City regarding visits to the City's website. This statement applies only to Websites with the City's official domain name (ci.minneapolis.mn.us, ci.mpls.mn.us) in the URL and to sites under contract with the city to provide online services to the city.

## Information you provide to us

[The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act](http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/stats/13/) (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13) governs all data collected, created, received, maintained or disseminated by the City. This law presumes that all such data is public unless classified otherwise. 

There are many exceptions to the presumption that all such data is public. If you are asked to provide private data through the use of an on-line form, you will be given an advisory about the proposed use of the data by the City before you submit the form online. 

If you choose to submit information to the City by email, the information you provide, including any identifying information, will be used, disseminated, and retained as needed in conducting the City’s official business and in accordance with the laws governing retention and dissemination of data. 

You should be aware of the provisions of the law as it relates to data that you are sending to the City. If you have questions about the classifications of particular information, you may want to contact the City's Data Practices Compliance Official, Craig Steiner at (612) 673-3282.

None of the information described above contains personal (identifying) information. 

For security purposes, and to maintain service for all users, the City’s network system may use software programs to identify attempts to gain unauthorized access or to damage or misuse the systems or the City’s web site.

## Cookies

Our web site traffic tracking system and some of the other on line services provided by the City may use "cookies" (simple text files that are created and stored on your computer) to aid in delivering on line services.
