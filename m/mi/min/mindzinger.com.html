<h1>MindZinger Privacy Policy </h1>

<p><em> (revised August 8th, 2007) </em></p>

<h4> What This Privacy Policy Covers</h4>
<ul type="disc">
  <li> This policy covers how MindZinger treats personal information that      MindZinger collects and receives, including information related to your past      use of MindZinger services. Personal information is information about you      that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or      phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. </li>
  <li> This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that MindZinger      does not own or control, or to people that MindZinger does not employ or      manage. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Information Collection and Use </h4>
<p> <em>General</em> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li> MindZinger collects personal information when you register with MindZinger,      when you use MindZinger services, when you visit MindZinger pages or the      pages of certain MindZinger partners, and when you enter promotions or      sweepstakes. MindZinger may combine information about you that we have with      information we obtain from business partners or other companies. </li>
  <li> When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address,      birth date, gender, and ZIP or postal code. When you register with      MindZinger and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. </li>
  <li> MindZinger collects information about your transactions with us and with      some of our business partners. </li>
  <li> MindZinger automatically receives and records information on our server logs      from your browser, including your IP address, MindZinger cookie information,      and the page you request. </li>
  <li> MindZinger uses information for the following general purposes: to customize      the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and      services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide      anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Information Sharing and Disclosure </h4>
<ul type="disc">
  <li> MindZinger does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with      other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or      services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the      following circumstances: </li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li> We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or        with MindZinger under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use        your personal information to help MindZinger communicate with you about        offers from MindZinger and our marketing partners. However, these        companies do not have any independent right to share this information. </li>
    <li> We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish        or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. </li>
    <li> We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,        prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,        situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any        person, violations of MindZinger's terms of use, or as otherwise required        by law. </li>
    <li> We transfer information about you if MindZinger is acquired by or merged        with another company. In this event, MindZinger will notify you before        information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different        privacy policy. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> MindZinger displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.      Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who      interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for      example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. </li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li> MindZinger does not provide any personal information to the advertiser        when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with        or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser        will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to        display the ad. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4> Cookies </h4>
<ul type="disc">
  <li> MindZinger may set and access MindZinger cookies on your computer. </li>
  <li> MindZinger lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our      pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of      their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.      Advertisers or other companies do not have access to MindZinger's cookies. </li>
</ul>
