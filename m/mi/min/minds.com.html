<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Welcome to the MINDS.com web site and online services. &nbsp;MINDS values the privacy of our members and others who visit and use the MINDS.com Site (individually, "You" or collectively, "Users"). &nbsp;We take your privacy seriously and make it a priority to protect personally identifiable information that we obtain from and about individuals both online and offline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By using the MINDS.com Site (whether or not you are a registered member), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the MINDS.com Site.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the MINDS Terms of Service Your use of MINDS and any personal information you provide on the MINDS.com Site are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the MINDS Terms of Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We want MINDS to be a network based on openness and sharing. &nbsp;We also want nothing more than to protect your universal rights to anonymity and privacy. &nbsp;In order to satisfy both of these elements, we allow people the freedom to create eponymous or anonymous accounts. &nbsp;Impersonation however is expressly prohibited on the MINDS.com Site. &nbsp;Spread of private information has the ability to affect populations in dramatic ways. &nbsp;For this reason Minds.com is heavily encrypted and we have implemented a wide spectrum of security certificates and privacy settings to make sure everyone is as safe and secure as possible. At the end of the day though, we cannot offer a 100% guarantee that your messages won't be hacked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Otherwise our mantra is "We have nothing to hide!" and all site data created here is licensed to the world under the<a href="http://www.minds.com/web/20130806055502/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/"> Creative Commons</a> &nbsp;and &nbsp;<a href="http://www.minds.com/web/20130806055502/http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a> because we think that people have a right to such accessibility that is generally not allowed by other networks. &nbsp;The main purpose of the internet is to share information. &nbsp;This is how it grows and evolves. &nbsp;The internet can't exist if we don't share our data, and the truth is that it is next to impossible to use the web without sharing your tracks. &nbsp;Everything is streaming and being recorded somewhere, and it is up to you to keep this in your mind and share responsibly.</p>
