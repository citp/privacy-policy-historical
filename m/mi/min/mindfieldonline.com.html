<h2 class="bullet">Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p><b>Registration</b></p>

We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest such as participating in our surveys.</p>
<p>You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level, gender and zip code). We encourage you to submit this information since omission of this information may hinder your being eligible to participate in certain surveys.</p> 
<p>McMillion Research is the sole owner of the information collected on MindField Online.

<p>We provide you the opportunity to participate in multiple surveys on our site.  We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys; however, we will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.  For example, if you agree to participate in a product test, we may need to share your personal information such as your name and mailing address with our client in order for the client to send you the product that you will be testing. In these cases you will be notified prior to our sharing the information and you can choose whether to in the product test. We would not allow our clients to use your information for any other purpose other than to send you the product to be tested.  For reward purposes, a randomly generated unique identifier will be used for completion tracking.</p>

<p><b>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</b></p>
<p>As a data collection facility, we share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers.  This information does not identify individual users.  In cases where we need to link aggregate user data associated with a specific individual for reward purposes and the like, we will associate a randomly generated unique identifier.</p>
<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>

<h2 class="bullet">Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This website may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by McMillion Research.  Please be aware that we, McMillion Research, are not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites.</p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this Website.</p>


<h2 class="bullet">Co-branded sites</h2>
<p>Co-branding is the method of having a user connect with a different website but make it appear to be the same site. In certain circumstance our clients may prefer to host the questionnaires themselves. If this is the case, the questionnaires may appear to be from <a href="">http://mindfieldonline.com</a>. Information provided to the clients is outlined in the Information Sharing and Disclosure section.</p>


<h2 class="bullet">Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@mindfieldonline.com">support@mindfieldonline.com</a>  or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.</p>


<h2 class="bullet">Security</h2>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can emails at <a href="mailto:privacy@mindfieldonline.com">privacy@mindfieldonline.com</a>.</p>

You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>


<h2 class="bullet">Changes in This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
