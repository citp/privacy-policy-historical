Please note that this policy may change from time to time so please check it frequently. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

Once we provide you with a user name and password you will be able to order product.

All new customers need to be approved by Mindray’s credit department, which may request further information, including but not limited to financial information, equipment information, and other personal information; this information will not be collected through the web site. We may collect other personal information when you provide comments or participate in surveys.

This information allows us to better administer the site and provide a more tailored and user friendly service to you. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent; if so, you may limit the functionality Mindray can provide you when you visit the site.

The information about you, which you provide and we collect in the course of our relationship, is used to facilitate your orders or other activities between us, and to provide you with both general and tailored information about offers, products, services or other useful information from us or others. If you order products or services from us, we may maintain an order history for your account. We also may combine information you have provided to us in communications offline with the information you have given us online (or vice versa), to provide a more customized experience for you when you deal with us. We may use demographic and site usage information collected from users to improve the usefulness of our site and to prepare aggregate, non-identifying, information used in marketing, site advertising, or similar activities.

By visiting our web site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of our company we may use the data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes identified in this policy, for the purposes identified in our other communications with you, or to provide the information to other Mindray businesses or subsidiaries which may be outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located in other jurisdictions. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data.

Personal data relating to an identified or identifiable individual that is submitted to this site will be collected, processed, stored, and disposed of in accordance with applicable U.S. law. U.S. law, however, may not provide the degree of protection to personal data which is available in other countries. The submission of personal data constitutes the User’s acknowledgement that s/he has read and understood this notice, and agrees to its terms. As our services evolve, the types of information we collect may change. Please check this policy frequently for the most current explanation of our data practices.

**VI. With Whom Do We Share Information?**

We may provide to others the aggregate statistics about our customers’ orders or related site activity for purposes of marketing or promotion.
