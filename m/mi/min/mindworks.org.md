  1. ##  **WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT**




We collect both personal information and non-personal information. “Personal information” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. “Non-personal information” includes technical information that does not identify an individual personally. Please note that over time, non-personal information may become personal information due to regulatory developments, technological advancements, or the co-mingling of personal and non-personal information. We collect the following information from and about you, and in the following ways:

  * When you create a Mindworks account, we ask for your name, email address and password. We do not collect payment method details (payment account number and billing address); this is handled by either the Apple App Store or Google Play.
  * If you sign in to Mindworks using your Facebook, we will use that service to authenticate your identity. We also receive other information that you have agreed may be provided by Facebook such as your username and e-mail address.
  * When you use Mindworks, information is automatically submitted about the computer, mobile device, or other devices you use to access Mindworks and about how you use Mindworks. We receive data about the meditations you use and the amount of completion or time spent in that meditation. We also receive your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, unique device identifier, the date and time of your visit, the pages you view and the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting Mindworks. In some cases, we link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.
  * Mindworks uses Appsee Analytics Service. Appsee may collect and store certain data about your activity in this app and track touch gestures, scrolling activity and user interaction activity. Mindworks does not use Appsee to collect any of your personal information, nor does it track your activity across applications outside of Mindworks. For more information on Appsee, see their [privacy policy](https://www.appsee.com/legal/privacypolicy). We are using the information collected by Appsee to improve user experience for Mindworks.



We do this to improve the content of the app and Website to provide a more personalized experience. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our site is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you.

From time to time we use push notifications in our mobile applications to send you messages about Mindworks or your account. You may opt out of receiving push notifications through your mobile device.

  2.  **COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES**



We, and third parties that we work with, use cookies and other similar technologies, such as flash cookies, web beacons, scripts and tags. We, or third parties, may use session cookies or persistent cookies. Session cookies only last for the specific duration of your visit and are deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device’s hard drive until you delete them or they expire. Different cookies are used to perform different functions, which we explain below:

  *  **Essential**. Some cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our website and mobile applications and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the Services. Without these cookies, we cannot enable appropriate content based on the type of device you are using.

These tools may record information about your usage, including how often you use the app, the events that occur within the app, and from where the app was downloaded. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
    * We use Google Analytics to measure how you interact with our Services and to improve your user experience.

  *  **Targeting Advertising**. We receive audience based data (such as pixel traffic and conversion data) from social media platform providers. We use this information to help us advertise Mindworks.
    * With your prior consent, we use Facebook Pixel. This pixel collects information about the usage of our Services and transmits this information to the social network Facebook, which uses this information for advertising and profiling purposes.

Please note that if you reject cookies, you may still use our Services, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Services may be limited.

In the US, the Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt-out of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) to learn more. Note that opting-out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising.
