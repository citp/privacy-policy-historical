# Privacy Policy | Minecraft 101

## Short version.

We do not collect any personal information, or use any technology such as cookies to track or identify visitors to the site.

We do, however, use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) to understand how many people are visiting which pages on the site, and [Google Adsense](http://google.com/privacy/ads/) to pay the bills. These products do use cookies to track users’ behaviour and history, but we at minecraft101.net do not have access to any personally identifying information.

## Longer version.

**Minecraft 101** does not require registration. We don’t have any information that we could use to identify you individually.

Minecraft 101 uses third-party companies to collect and report detailed statistics about site use, but these statistics do not identify individual users, except to the extent that you may have provided this information to those companies.

### Cookies

We may use third party products to display ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic. These social media, advertising and analytics partners use cookies (small pieces of data saved on your computer) in order to work properly. Each third-party company has its own privacy policy.

#### Google AdSense

Minecraft 101 uses Google AdSense, a third-party advertising service operated by Google Inc., to serve ads when you visit Yesterland. Google AdSense may use “DoubleClick DART cookie” technology to track information about your visits to Yesterland and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that Google AdSense determines might be of interest to you. Google AdSense does not track your name, address, email address, or telephone number. If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choices about not having this information used in this way, please refer to [Google’s policies](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/).

#### Google Analytics

Minecraft 101 uses Google Analytics, a third-party website analysis service operated by Google Inc., to collect and report detailed statistics about visits to Yesterland.

Google Analytics’ reporting is private. Google Analytics may place or read cookies. If you would like more information about cookies for Google Analytics, please see [Google’s Privacy statement](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

### Server logs

As is the usual case on web servers, each web transaction (request for HTML code and images) is recorded in a daily log file. This log file includes information such as your IP address, browser type, and operating system. The log does not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number. The log is used as input to produce reports of website statistics.

### Silktide Cookie Consent

The European Union says we need you consent to having cookies laced on your computer. We’ve used a script provided by [Silktide](https://silktide.com/tools/cookie-consent/) to do this, and they of course set a cookie to remember this consent and not bother you so often.
