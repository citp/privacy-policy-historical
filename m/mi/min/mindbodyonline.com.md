## MINDBODY provides a Safe Harbor for European clients

How is a business in Europe protected when using software that's hosted on a server in California? 
     Safe Harbor, it was created by the European Union and US Department of Commerce. 

Safe Harbor was a better practice policy that resulted from the internet boom of the 1990s and the formation of the European Union. Both the US and the newly formed EU were looking for ways to regulate websites that were collecting contact information. They wanted to make sure that companies were not selling contact information to third parties, blocking individuals from updating or deleting their contact information, and a few other unscrupulous practices. The US Dept of Commerce came up with seven principles that all companies needed to comply with to qualify for the Safe Harbor List. It's the main reason websites have a privacy policy in their footer. It also allows EU businesses using websites hosted on US soil to litigate data security issues, which is incredibly important if your business is located in Europe.

The seven Safe Harbor Principles that MINDBODY complies with are:

  * Notice
  * Choice
  * Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)
  * Access
  * Security
  * Data integrity
  * Enforcement
