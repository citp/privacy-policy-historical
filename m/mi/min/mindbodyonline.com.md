# MINDBODY: Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: October 18, 2016_

At MINDBODY, we respect your privacy and are committed to maintaining your trust. This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with your use of our products and services, including our consumer-facing mobile application (“MINDBODY App”), our online business management software (“Software Service”), and any other MINDBODY products and services offered through any other websites and mobile applications that direct you to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service”). When you access or use the Service, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. 

The following terms will have the meanings indicated below. Please refer to our [Terms of Service](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/terms-of-service) for any capitalized terms that are not defined in this policy. 

“ **End User** ” means any individual who interacts with the Service, including users of our mobile applications such as the MINDBODY App, and individuals who book appointments, purchase services and otherwise interact with our Subscribers through the Service.

“ **Other Information** ” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as browser and device information, app usage data, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, demographic information and other information provided by you, and aggregated information.

“ **Personal Information** ” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable person, such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, and social media account ID. It does not include strings of code such as browser cookie IDs or mobile device identifiers.

“ **Subscriber** ” is any business or entity that subscribes to (or otherwise accesses or uses) our Software Service. 

We may collect information about you whenever you use the Service, for example:

  * When you create an account on the MINDBODY App, we may ask for Personal Information such as your name, email, mailing address, social media account ID, and other information you may provide with your account. You can edit certain information in your account through the My Info tab in the app. 
  * If you’re a customer of one of our Subscribers, we collect information about you when you interact with their business through the Service. For example, if you initiate a transaction with the Subscriber through the Service, such as an appointment or purchase, we may collect information about you, such as your name, email, credit card information, as well as any other information you provide in order to process the transaction. 
  * If you’re a Subscriber, we collect information about your business that is submitted to the Service under your account. When you sign up for our Software Service, we ask for your company name, address, phone number, email, credit card information, tax identification number, and other information about your business, as well as names and email addresses of authorized individuals on your account. We also collect Personal Information about your customers that they provide to the Service when they initiate a transaction with you, such as an appointment or purchase.
  * We may store information that your computer or mobile device provides to us in connection with your use of the Service, such as type of computer or mobile device, unique device identifier, IP Address, MAC address, device’s operating system and physical location (including geolocation, beacon based location, and GPS location).  You may disable our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example by disabling “Location Services” for the MINDBODY App in iOS privacy settings.  We may also store usage data such as the date and time the application on your device accesses our servers, and what information and files have been downloaded to the application based on your device number. 
  * We may deploy and read identifiers (generally, strings of code) that we have associated with a browser, and we may collect mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFAs or Google Android Ad IDs. We generally use and share these identifiers to help tailor more relevant ads to you both on our properties and when you interact with other websites and mobile apps.
  * If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as an appointment or purchase, we may collect and store information, including your name, phone number, address, email, and credit card information as well as any other information you provide to us, in order to process your transaction. This information may be shared with third parties for the same purposes. We encrypt credit card numbers using industry standard technology.

  * We may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, strategic and joint marketing partners, social media platforms, people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties. For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your MINDBODY App account, certain information from your social media account may be shared with us, including information that’s part of your profile or your friends’ profiles. ****

We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways.  We and/or our third party partners may employ various tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and analytics software, that help us better manage content on our Service by informing us what content is effective. 

**Cookies**

When you visit our website or otherwise interact with the Service we (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may send one or more “cookies” to your computer or other devices. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers stored on your computer through your web browser and are used by most websites to help personalize your web experience. Some cookies may facilitate additional site features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, allowing social interactions, analyzing usage for site optimization, providing custom content, allowing third parties to provide social sharing tools, and serving images or videos from third party websites. Some features on this site will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our site. ****

We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interest of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but some features on the site will not function properly.

Functional cookies, persistent and session type, store information to enable core site functionality, such as Live Chat and Client ID remembrance.

Analytics cookies allow us to count page visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site and our marketing campaigns. 

Advertising cookies may be set through our website by our advertising partners. Data may be collected by these companies that enable them to serve up advertisements on other sites that are relevant to your interests. 

**Web Beacons**

We (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may use Web Beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our Service, or other information we or they have collected. Web Beacons are tiny graphic objects that are embedded in a web page or email and are usually invisible to the user but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. Web Beacons may be used within the Service to track email open rates, web page visits or form submissions. In some cases, we tie the information gathered by Web Beacons to our Subscribers’ and End Users’ Personal Information. For example, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

**Flash and HTML5 Storage**

We use Local Shared Objects, such as Flash cookies, AND/OR Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use Flash cookies or HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

**Do Not Track Signals**

At this time we do not respond to browser ‘do not track’ signals. **  **

This information includes internet protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Service and report on activities and trends.  This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. ****

**Advertising Networks**

We may partner with third party data or ad network(s) and other service providers to show you relevant ads, including ads displayed on the Service and on other companies’ websites or apps, on any of your devices. We and our service providers may use cookies and web beacons to deploy and read cookie identifiers and Mobile Ad IDs, associated with your activities on the Service, third party web sites, mobile apps or other information we collect, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. They may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. These ad networks and their customers may also use any of this information to measure ad performance, understand their (or our) audience, or otherwise improve and enhance their marketing.

Similarly, we or a third party data partner may associate cookies with hashed (non-human readable) versions of your registration data (e.g., your email address), along with other interest-based or demographic data. You can learn more about or opt out of this type of advertising through the links in the following paragraph.

  * **Android Devices** : If you have an Android device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by clicking on Google Settings > Ads, and selecting the option to opt-out of interest-based ads.

You will continue to receive generic ads.

**Social Media Features and Widgets**

The Service includes social media features such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.  Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

Our Website offers publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose Personal Information through MINDBODY public message boards, blogs, or forums, this information may be collected and used by others. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [support@mindbodyonline.com](mailto:support@mindbodyonline.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information or some content (if, for example, it is reposted by another user), in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

You can log in to some of our Service using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Website to your profile page to share with others within your network. 

In addition, when using some of our mobile applications we may allow you a chance to tell friends about our services by accessing the contacts in your Facebook or other social media account. 

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the MINDBODY App via SMS or email, we will ask for your friend’s email address or telephone number. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or SMS message inviting them to visit the mobile application. MINDBODY stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time message and tracking the success of the referral program. Your friend may contact us at [unsubscribe@mindbodyonline.com](mailto:unsubscribe@mindbodyonline.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

When using this feature we will access the contact list of your device for the sole purpose of assisting you in finding individuals to whom you wish to send these communications. If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Service, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Please also note that when using the SMS feature charges from your carrier may apply.

Your provider's standard data and messaging rates apply to all SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider.

Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS Service may include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name, and the date, time, and content of your messages. The use of this information will be in accordance with this Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each offering.

If you submit testimonials, ratings or reviews to the Service, any Personal Information you include will be displayed in the Service. If you want your testimonial removed, please contact us at [testimonial@mindbodyonline.com](mailto:testimonial@mindbodyonline.com). 

We also partner with third-party service providers to collect and display ratings and review content on our web site. If the content collected by a third party for display includes Personal Information, it will not be posted unless consent is provided by the individual. ****

We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information that we believe to be necessary or appropriate in the following circumstances: 

  * As required by law, including laws outside your country of residence, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.
  * When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request including a request from authorities outside your country of residence.
  * To enforce our terms and conditions.
  * To allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damage we may sustain.
  * If MINDBODY is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice within the software and/or on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.



This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including our Subscribers and any third party operating any Third Party Offering, site or other products and services used in connection with our Service.  The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. 

Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Service. 

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed to provide the applicable Service you use, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
