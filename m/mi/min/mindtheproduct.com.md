# Privacy Policy - Mind the Product

_Last update: December 19th 2018_

## Introduction

Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at Mind the Product, how Mind the Product uses it, and what choices you have. Our systems and procedures are subject to ongoing change as both our technology and data practices evolve and improve, and this document will reflect that.

When we talk about “Mind the Product,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to Mind the Product Ltd.., the company which provides the Services. When we talk about the “Services” in this policy, we are referring to our online community, events platform, media outlet, and events.

## Information we Collect and how we use it

Where Mind the Product collects or processes Personal Data, it does so on behalf of the Customer in order to deliver services, or to keep the customer aware of services they have either expressed an explicit interest in or are directly related to services they are explicitly interested in.

If you create a profile on www.mindtheproduct.com, or are a ticket-holder for any of our events, you are a “customer” or “user,” as described in the User Terms of Service.

Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is collected and shared. Mind the Product does not control these choices, or default settings, which are offered by makers of your browser or mobile device operating system.

## Sharing and Disclosure

There are times when information described in this privacy policy may be shared by Mind the Product. This section discusses only how Mind the Product may share such information.

### 1\. Customer Data

Mind the Product will never sell or share your personal data for the independent commercial gain of a third party. However, we may share Customer Data in accordance with our agreement with the Customer and the Customer’s instructions, including:

With third-party service providers and agents. We may engage third party companies or individuals to process Customer Data & Personal information in order to deliver our services; for example, for payment processing, badge-printing and networking at conferences, or sending of newsletters.

Specifically, Mind the Product hosts commercial exhibitors at our conferences, and these exhibitors will request to scan attendees’ badges to be granted access to our attendees’ contact details.

If a customer agrees to have their badge scanned by an exhibitor at one of our events, the customer understands that Mind the Product will share the customer’s basic Personally Identifying Information (name, company name, job title, email address) with said exhibitor. Where the exhibitor is using a data capture solution other than that provided by Mind the Product, the customer will be entering into a separate data usage agreement with the exhibitor, entirely independent of Mind the Product.

Regardless of the exact process of data capture, we require our exhibitors to give clear, unambiguous disclosure regarding how the scanned personal information of our customers will be used, and to only capture a customer’s details if said customer then gives their explicit consent.

### 2\. Other Information

Mind the Product may use aggregated and non-identifying information describing the demographics and behaviours of our customers and community for research or marketing purposes.

### 3\. Other Types of Disclosure

Mind the Product may share or disclose Customer Data and other information as follows:

**3.1 During changes to our business structure**

If we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of Mind the Product's assets, financing, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such activities (e.g. due diligence).

**3.2 To comply with laws**

To comply with legal or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests, court orders and legal process.

**3.3 To enforce our rights, prevent fraud and for safety**

To protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of us or third parties, including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection with investigating and preventing fraud.

## Security

Mind the Product takes security seriously. We take various steps to protect information you provide to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children’s Information

Our Services are not directed to children under 13. If you learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without consent, please contact us.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we will post any changes on this page. If you continue to use the Services after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy.

## Data Sovereignty

Mind the Product is based and operates from within the United Kingdom. Where possible, we ensure that any data processing done on our behalf takes place within the EU, but where data has to move beyond the EU, we work to ensure that our Data Processors adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, or have equivalent legal protections in place to ensure the security and privacy of your data.

If you have any questions about how your data is handled, please contact us using the details below.
