**MINYANVILLE.COM PRIVACY STATEMENT**

The Privacy Statement was last updated January 14th, 2006.

Minyanville.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following statement to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of the Minyanville.com Web site. The Minyanville.com Web site is owned and operated by Minyanville Publishing and Multimedia, LLC. 

**Gathering of Information**

 **Personal Information**

Minyanville.com collects personally identifying information from two categories of Minyanville.com Web site users. Personal information about paying subscribers is collected as well as from non-paying subscribers (for example, students are $10.00 with an .edu address). In addition, we may ask you for additional information when you register to receive a newsletter or so we can better understand our user base to constantly upgrade and improve the Minyanville service. You always have the option not to provide the additional information we request. If you choose not to provide the additional information we request, you can still visit most of the Minyanville.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a data file that certain Web sites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited. Minyanville.com uses cookies solely to track user traffic patterns throughout the Minyanville.com Web site. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user. The acceptance of cookies allows the subscriber to experience a more streamlined and/or enhanced navigation to the content on the site.

Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our Web site, you may not be able to use certain features of the site. 

**Browser Level Information**

Minyanville.com Web servers automatically collect information about a site user's IP address, browser type and referrer by reading this information from the user's browser (information provided by every user's browser). This information is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our Web site. This information is automatically logged by most Web sites.

 **Use of Information**

All information collected is for the building of a subscriber database to validate used id's and passwords as well as to solicit sales or offerings of additional Minyanville products. Generally, the Minyanville database of paying or non-paying subscribers will not be sold or shared with third parties except when we believe that the law requires it or a regulatory entity requests it, to protect other users of the Minyanville.com site or in emergency or extenuating circumstances. 

One of our goals in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our Web site. We achieve this goal by, among other things, providing interactive communications such as our electronic newsletters to the e-mail address that you provide to us, and developing future editorial content based on your interests. You are always entitled to unsubscribe to certain email communications though the ÒManage AccountÓ link. To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our Web site users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall. 

Minyanville.com may derive revenue from advertising. In order to attract and retain advertisers we may use the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience. **We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users.**

Minyanville.com may also disclose information about our users when we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required by law. 

When you are on an area of Minyanville.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Minyanville.com as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Minyanville.com. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service. These parties, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies.

In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by our users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided directly to advertisers. 

Please be aware that advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those parties and Web sites linked to Minyanville.com are not covered by this privacy statement. Minyanville.com users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others. 

This statement may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
