              <p><strong>SEARCH APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Search Applications provide features to facilitate Internet search services while using the MS Products. This search functionality may be implemented through browser settings and <q>extensions</q>. These set your browser homepage, start page, new tab page and/or default search setting(s), depending on which MS Product you are using and what options you select. We may provide you a way to decline or opt-out of the setting(s) change by unchecking the appropriate checkbox during the download and installation process for the relevant MS Product that provides access to the Search Applications</strong></p>
              <p><strong>EXTENSIONS</strong></p>
              <p>The MS Products are browser extensions and websites that we offer to you. The extensions can be downloaded onto your browser and offer a range of functions, including allowing you to manage and convert your documents, managing your calendar and providing you access to other functionality across the internet. Some of these MS Products, such as Chrome new tab products, may be available through the online store operated by the browser developer (e.g., the Chrome web store) and the user disclosures and options may vary based on the store's requirements.</p>
              <p>The search features (and other features such as maps, local radio and document management), may be customized by you on your device. In addition, you may be able to disable or remove the default search features by removing or disabling the applicable extension you downloaded or changing your default search within your browser. This will depend on your browser and its relevant features.
