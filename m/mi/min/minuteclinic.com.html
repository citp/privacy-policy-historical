    <h3 style="color: black">
        THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED
        AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.
        <br>
        PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY</h3>
</center>
<p>
    During your treatment at MinuteClinic, our caregivers may gather information about
    your medical history and current health. This Notice of Privacy Practices explains
    how that information may be used and shared with others. It also explains your privacy
    rights regarding this information.
</p>
<p>
    MinuteClinic is required by law to abide by the terms of this Notice, to make sure
    that information that identifies you is kept private, and to give you this Notice
    of our legal duties and practices with respect to medical information about you.</p>
<h4>
    Uses and Disclosures of your Health Information
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>MinuteClinic may use health information to carry out treatment, payment and health
        care 1. operations.
        <ol>
            <li>Treatment is the provision, coordination or management of health care. For example,
                we may use and disclose your information to consult with a third party or to refer
                you to other health care providers. We will get your written consent prior to making
                disclosures outside MinuteClinic for treatment purposes, except in emergencies.
            </li>
            <li>Payment includes the activities necessary to obtain reimbursement for the provision
                of health care. For example, we may need to give your health plan information about
                treatment you received at MinuteClinic so your health plan will pay us or reimburse
                you for the treatment. We will get your written consent prior to making disclosures
                for payment purposes. </li>
            <li>Health care operations include the activities necessary for MinuteClinic to run
                its business operations. For example, we may use your information to review treatment
                and services and to evaluate the performance of our staff.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We may use or disclose your health information:
        <ol>
            <li>When required by federal, state, or local law. </li>
            <li>To support public health activities by reporting as required or authorized by state
                or federal law. These reports may include the reporting of exposure to a communicable
                disease or risk of spreading a disease or condition. </li>
            <li>To cooperate with law enforcement officials for certain law enforcement purposes
                as directed by a court order, warrant, criminal subpoena, or other lawful process.
            </li>
            <li>To report abuse or neglect.</li>
            <li>To support health oversight activities that are authorized by law, such as administrative
                or criminal investigations, inspections, licensure or disciplinary actions and other
                similar activities necessary for appropriate oversight of government benefit programs
                or functions. </li>
            <li>When required by a coroner or medical examiner for the purpose of identifying a
                deceased person, determining a cause of death or other duties as required by law.
            </li>
            <li>When necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health
                and safety of a person or the public and the disclosure is to a person reasonably
                able to prevent or lessen the threat, as consistent with applicable law and standards.
            </li>
            <li>For judicial or administrative proceedings, in response to a valid court order,
                administrative order, a grand jury subpoena, or with your written consent. </li>
            <li>For research purposes, with your written authorization or as permitted by state
                law.</li>
            <li>To business associates to perform functions on MinuteClinic’s behalf, if the business
                associate has signed an agreement to protect the confidentiality of the information.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We may disclose your health information to a family member, other relatives, or
        a close friend or any other person you identify if the information relates to that
        person’s involvement in your health care if you consent to such a disclosure. If
        you are unable to agree or object to the use or disclosure, we may disclose such
        information as necessary if we determine that it is in your best interest.</li>
    <li>In other situations, your written authorization will be obtained before MinuteClinic
        will use or disclose your health information to third parties outside MinuteClinic.</li>
    <li>State and federal laws may be more stringent and may prohibit certain uses and disclosures
        identified above. When another law is more stringent than HIPAA, we will follow
        the more stringent requirements. For example, some state laws require additional
        protection for records related to mental health treatment, drug and alcohol treatment,
        and HIV-related information. </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Patient Rights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You may request MinuteClinic to restrict uses and disclosures of your health information.

        (b) whether you want to limit MinuteClinic’s use, disclosure, or both, and (c) to
        whom you want the limits to apply, for example, if you want to prohibit disclosures
        to your spouse. </li>

        at alternative 2. locations. For example, you may request that we communicate with
        you only by mail. We will accommodate all reasonable requests, but your request
        must specify how or where you wish to be contacted, and we may require you to provide
        information about how payment will be handled. You must request confidential communications

        information. This right does not apply to certain health information, including
        information compiled in reasonable anticipation of or for litigation and other information
        not subject to the right to access information under state law and Requests for
        access to health information should be made in writing to MinuteClinic, HIPAA. Privacy
        Office. If access is denied, you will be provided with a written explanation that
        sets forth the basis for the denial, a description of how you may review those rights
        and a description of how you may complain.</li>
    <li>You have the right to request that MinuteClinic amend your health information if
        it is incorrect or incomplete. Requests for amendment of information should be made
        in writing to MinuteClinic, Privacy Office, and you must provide a reason that supports
        your request to have the information changed. MinuteClinic may deny your request
        for an amendment if the request is not in writing and submitted to the Privacy Office.
        In addition, we may deny your request if you ask us to amend information that: (a)
        was not created by MinuteClinic (unless the person or entity that created the information
        is no longer available to make the amendment); (b) is not part of the medical information
        kept by MinuteClinic; (c) is not part of the information you would be permitted
        to inspect and copy; or (d) is accurate and complete.</li>
    <li>At your request, MinuteClinic will provide you with an accounting of disclosures
        by MinuteClinic of your health information during the six years prior to the date

        to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations; 2) directly to you or
        your personal representatives; 3) prior to the effective date of this notice; or
        4) based on your written authorization. If you request more than one accounting
        within a 12-month period, MinuteClinic will charge a reasonable, cost-based fee
        for each subsequent accounting. Requests for a request of an accounting of disclosures
        should be made in writing to MinuteClinic, Privacy Office. </li>

    <li>You may exercise your rights through a personal representative as permitted or required
        by applicable law. Your personal representative may be required to produce evidence
        of authority to act on your behalf before that person will be given access to your
        information or allowed to take any action for you. </li>
    <li>If you believe your privacy rights have been violated you may complain to the MinuteClinic
        Privacy Office. You may also file a complaint with the Secretary of the U.S. Department
        of Health and Human Services. All complaints should be submitted in writing. You
