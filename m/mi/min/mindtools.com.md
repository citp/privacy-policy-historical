# Privacy Policy

We promise to tell you how we use your data, and we promise to keep it secure.

The purpose of our free newsletter and associated emails is to showcase great examples of our career excellence resources for free, and to make offers and offer bonuses that make it attractive to experience the full range of our individual and corporate paid-for services. We hope that you'll love the free tools you'll get by subscribing to the newsletter, and, as a result, we hope that you'll want to use our paid-for resources as well!

We will use your first name and email address to contact you by email, and by clicking the button to subscribe to our emails, you will be agreeing to this use of your personal data. When you subscribe, we'll also record your "IP Address" - this helps us to guess at your approximate location, so that we can send emails to you at a time that is convenient for you.

Optionally, you can also let us know your job level and whether you work in Learning and Development, and this will help us be more specific with the information we send you.

We will carefully curate our Newsletters and associated emails to ensure they are relevant to you and proportionate to your expressed interests. We use industry standard tools to understand you and ensure our social media adverts are only shown to people who are likely to be interested in Mind Tools. We have assessed our use of your personal data as having minimal impact on your privacy and we will keep it that way. 

We will not use your name or email address for any other purpose, nor will we pass it on to anyone else. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email that we send you.

If you'd like to find out more about any of this, please read our full [Privacy Policy](https://www.mindtools.com/privacy-policy) or contact us at [privacy@mindtools.com.](mailto:privacy@mindtools.com)

If you are accessing our Website, or have opened an account with us, through an arrangement established with your employer, we will only contact you about your account and the resources your employer has made available to you. We will not contact you about other products and services we offer.

### Publicly sourced company email addresses

We may obtain individuals’ company email addresses from public sources (either directly or through a third party provider) in order to send relevant communications about our products and services in accordance with the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations. We will ensure at all times that our processing of such publicly sourced company email addresses is lawful and we will implement any changes which may be required when the proposed EU ePrivacy Regulation comes into force.

### Advertising and Analytics

When you use our website or App, we or a third party partner may serve you advertisements that may be of interest to you. These advertisements are based on information relating to your access to, and use of, our website and other websites. If you would like more general information about these practices, [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/)

We use the Facebook pixel in order to understand the types of people that visit our website and show you relevant advertisements for things you may have looked at on our website. You can find out more about the Facebook Pixel [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217), including how to adjust your preferences with Facebook.

We also use third party analytics providers like Google Adsense to serve ads to you based on your prior visits to our website and other sites on the internet. You can always opt out of interest based advertising by visiting Google’s [Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/).

### How we build our audience profile through Social Media platforms

We work with social and business media platforms including Facebook and LinkedIn to bring you targeted advertising about our products and services and improve your experience on our website. To do this, we provide them with a list of email addresses and they confirm if they operate accounts with those email addresses. This enables us to provide relevant advertising on each platform to those accounts and to build an audience profile to help our adverts reach other people on each platform who may be interested in our products and services.

If the platform does not have an account with a matching email address, the contract terms under which they act as our processor for this purpose does not permit them to make any further use of the email address we provided.

We believe we have a legitimate interest in customising our social media communications in this way and that there is minimal impact on your privacy. Nevertheless, you can always tell us not to share your information with Facebook, LinkedIn or any other platform by notifying us at [privacy@mindtools.com](mailto:privacy@mindtools.com). Alternatively, if you have an account on any platform, you can set your preferences via your platform account.
