We use “cookies” to customize your browsing experience. “Cookies” are pieces of information stored by your web browser on your computer on behalf of a website and returned to the website on request. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, § 13.15, subdivisions 4 and 5, this is the required notice to users that we will install a cookie on your computer at certain times when you access this website.

We use cookies for a number of purposes, including but not limited to: carrying data about your current session at the site from one web page to the next and identifying you to the site between visits. Unless otherwise notified on this site, we will not store data using cookies other than for these purposes.

We also may use cookies to evaluate our website and to track advertising campaign performance from banner ads, opt-in e-mails and through third-party advertising services. These cookies and tracking pixels (also called web beacons, action tags, floodlight tags, or transparent GIF files) contain an ID number that allows us to track the pages you’ve visited within our website. We compile this data with that of other users to track overall traffic patterns to help us improve the layout of our site and to understand, for example, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. The tags are industry-standard technology and are anonymous. No personally identifiable information is stored on these cookies or web pixels.

We also use Google Analytics to analyze traffic to our site. Google uses cookies to provide this service to us. Google’s cookies are used to store information, such as what time your visit occurred, whether you have been to the site before, and what site referred you to our web page. Information about your visits to specific Minnesota State college or university websites and the MinnState.edu page and its subdomains may be combined and shared within the Minnesota State system.

Cookies may also be set by an organization other than Minnesota State, such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, or other social media services for which we have implemented “plug-ins.” Information on their cookie policies can be found on these sites directly.

Information from these activities is used only for the purpose of maintaining the security and performance of our networks and computer systems. As with other personally identifiable information, we do not release this information to others without your consent unless required by law, including Minn. Stat. § 13.15.
