Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint>], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

**A) Definitions**

“Personal Data” means information that (1)is transferred from the EU/EEA or Switzerland to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.

“Sensitive Personal Information” means Personal Data that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.

**B) Principles**

MindTickle may receive Personal Data from itself as well as from its affiliates, customers, prospective customers and business partners and other parties located in the EU/EEA. Such information may contain names, addresses, email addresses, title, department, location, training materials, training performance data, and includes information recorded on various media as well as electronic data.

MindTickle complies with the Principles with respect to processing Personal Data:

  1.     1. MindTickle generally does not receive personal data directly from individuals. In the event that MindTickle does receive Personal Data directly from individuals, MindTickle shall inform an individual of the purpose for which MindTickle collects and uses their Personal Data and the types of third parties to which MindTickle discloses or may disclose that Personal Data. MindTickle shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to MindTickle, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before MindTickle uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. MindTickle may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
    2. MindTickle generally does not receive Personal Data directly from individuals. In the event that MindTickle does receive Personal Data directly from individuals, MindTickle will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a non-Agent third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, MindTickle will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-Agent third party or for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. MindTickle shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information. Agents, technology vendors and/or contractors of MindTickle may have access to an individual’s Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of MindTickle or providing or enabling elements of the services. All such agents, technology vendors and contractors who have access to such information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for MindTickle or as otherwise required by law.
    3. **Accountability for Onward Transfer.** MindTickle shall ensure that any third party to which Personal Data may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or is subject to laws providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and agrees in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection.
    4. **Data Security.** MindTickle shall take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. MindTickle has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, MindTickle cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data on or transmitted via the Internet.
    5. **Data Integrity** **and Purpose Limitation.** MindTickle shall only process Personal Data in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, MindTickle shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
    6. **Access and Recourse.** MindTickle acknowledges the individual’s right to access their Personal Data. However, MindTickle generally does not receive Personal Data directly from individuals but indirectly, via its customers. In the event that MindTickle does receive Personal Data directly from individuals or that a MindTickle customer cannot access the individual’s Personal Data, MindTickle shall allow an individual access to their Personal Data and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
    7. **Enforcement and Liability.** The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over MindTickle’s compliance with the Privacy Shield. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, MindTickle commits to resolve complaints about privacy and our collection or use of Personal Data. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy Statement should first contact us at:
