This Privacy Policy applies only to the website on which it appears, and not to any other Mindshare, GroupM or other website or service.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also provides information about activities we undertake across internet websites on behalf of Mindshare clients.&nbsp; </p><p>Mindshare is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing.&nbsp; Accordingly, we are committed to observing applicable industry guidelines including those established jointly by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, American Association of Advertising Agencies and Direct Marketing Association.&nbsp; We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also seeking to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients.&nbsp; Mindshare provides services for its clients such as media planning and buying, marketing communications planning, campaign analytics and research, paid search placement and search engine optimization, branded entertainment as well as sports sponsorships ("Services").</p><p>The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide clear notice about the user information we may collect online in connection with our Services and on our own website.&nbsp; </p><p>The next few sections below describe how we collect user information in connection with the operation of our Services for our clients, such as through advertisements that may appear on various websites on the Internet.&nbsp; Therefore, certain information collection by Mindshare through the use of cookies used in the Services, as described below, may occur on numerous websites across the Internet.&nbsp; </p><p>For information on how we collect and use information that is collected directly on this website (as opposed to through the Services), please see the section entitled "Your Correspondence on this Website."</p><p>Information We Collect Through our Services</p><p>We do not collect personally identifiable information ("PII") from users online through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients unless users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it, in a text field for example.&nbsp; PII generally refers to identifying information such as an individual's name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.&nbsp; </p><p>Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services</p><p>We do collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII) to identify computers that we have interacted with before.&nbsp; For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a computer that has previously seen an advertisement we launched on behalf of a client.&nbsp; In the context of Non-PII, whenever we refer to ‘you' or ‘yours,' please remember that we may be referring to a computer and not an identifiable person since we generally do not know who is using a computer at any particular time.</p><p>Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we offer a range of Services to allow advertisers to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements across numerous websites and to prevent excessive or repeated deliveries of the same advertisements.&nbsp; For example, if we think that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver interest-based online advertisements to you about a particular type of apparel. You can learn more about such advertising practices by visiting www.iab.net/privacymatters.</p><p>We may collect Non-PII regarding your web browsing, usage or interactions with advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients.&nbsp; We do this to better customize the sort of advertisements you see on various websites and for other purposes such as research and analysis.&nbsp; Non-PII may include information such as the type of Internet browser used by an online user, the type of computer operating system used, the computer's Internet protocol ("IP") address, the domain name of the websites visited before and after viewing an advertisement, as well as information related to websites and web pages a user is viewing when an advertisement is shown.&nbsp; <br>We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels and related technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser and computer.&nbsp; A pixel is a line of code which is used by a website or third party t to assign online activities to a computer or browser.&nbsp; The use of a pixel allows websites and us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page.&nbsp; Additional Non-PII from an earlier period or interaction may be included in the pixel.&nbsp; Though Non-PII does not personally identify anyone, we are still committed to giving users the opportunity to exercise choice about the Non-PII we collect.&nbsp;&nbsp; See Section titled: </p><p>User Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies</p><p>Europe</p><p>Please note - in some countries an IP address is considered PII by applicable law.&nbsp; If we conduct business in such countries and we know that you are located in such a country, we will treat your IP address as PII.</p><p>In such countries we interpose a "black box" which is operated by an independent third party and which separates the user's IP address from other data we collect. If your browser does not accept cookies or if the opt-out-cookie is set, no tracking takes place. </p><p>targ.ad 2.0 is a service of ours which places a cookie on your computer for the purpose of interest-based marketing as described above.&nbsp; This service is primarily used Europe.&nbsp; The service has been certified with the Data Privacy Seal issued by the Independent Data Protection Authority of the Federal State Schleswig-Holstein in Germany in March 2010.&nbsp; You may opt-out of the targ.ad 2.0 cookie by following the instructions in the Section titled: User Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies.</p><p><br>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties </p><p>We do not collect PII via our client's advertisements, and therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on our or other websites to non-affiliated third parties.&nbsp; If you affirmatively and deliberately provide PII via one of our client's advertisements who was identified to you at the time of collection, then that PII will be provided to such client, and such PII shall be subject to that client's privacy policy.</p><p>We may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and information derived from it, to our clients and vendors.&nbsp; This Non-PII may be used by our clients to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites and for other purposes as described above.&nbsp; This information does not include any PII that can be used to contact or identify any person individually.&nbsp; Further, we encourage our clients, as applicable, to use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to publish privacy policies that tell you about how the information they are gathering is being used.&nbsp; We urge you to always read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand issues relating to your online privacy.</p><p>We may disclose a user's Non-PII to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.&nbsp; In addition and if permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose and provide access to a user's PII and Non-PII to our vendors and contractors who are performing services on our behalf.&nbsp; However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any purpose other than providing services to us.</p><p>User Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies</p><p>We use technology, which includes cookies, in the delivery of our Services.&nbsp; We believe that the use of these tools enables us and our advertiser clients to provide users with a more meaningful web experience. </p><p>At all times, you may adjust your computer's web browser settings to refuse all cookies.&nbsp; However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the websites you visit or take full advantage of all the website offerings and interest-based advertising.&nbsp; You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p><p>You may also choose to opt out of us (Mindshare) collecting Non-PII in connection with the advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients.&nbsp; Of course, doing this means that you would no longer receive customized advertisements delivered through our Mindshare proprietary technology.&nbsp; To opt-out of our Non-PII collection, click here :&nbsp;
