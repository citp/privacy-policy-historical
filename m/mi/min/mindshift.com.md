# Privacy Policy - mindSHIFT

mindSHIFT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. PRIVACY POLICY

mindSHIFT Technologies, Inc. ("mindSHIFT") is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following policy carefully to understand what information we gather online and how we will use that information. Because mindSHIFT will continue to develop new technologies to improve our website (the "Site"), this policy is subject to change. We encourage you to check the Privacy Policy each time that you visit the site so that you understand our current privacy policy. By using the Site, you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy in effect at that time.

**What personally identifiable information does mindSHIFT collect?**  
Prospective customers, partners and employees, as well as those seeking information about mindSHIFT, may voluntarily submit information to mindSHIFT by completing forms on various pages throughout the site. The required information on these forms is information that we need to contact these individuals, such as first and last name, company name, phone number, and e-mail address. These individuals may also voluntarily submit additional information that will help mindSHIFT evaluate their needs, the services the user provides, or the user's employment qualifications. If you contact us, we may also keep a record of that communication.

**Who receives the information submitted?**  
When information is submitted through our website, it is immediately routed to the appropriate department within mindSHIFT. For example, if you submit information on our "Careers" page, your information is routed to our personnel department. If an improper form is completed (i.e., if a potential client completes the partner information form), the information will be forwarded to the proper department within a reasonable time after the user's error is discovered.

**How does mindSHIFT use information that you provide?**  
The information submitted to mindSHIFT will only be used for internal purposes, except when necessary in our sole discretion to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental or judicial request, or to protect mindSHIFT or its employees, clients or business partners. Otherwise, the information submitted will not be provided to any third parties. mindSHIFT may retain copies of all information submitted to mindSHIFT in either electronic or paper form, at its sole discretion. mindSHIFT may also provide aggregated statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related website information to reputable third-party vendors and marketing companies, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

**A word of caution about security**  
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we attempt to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security.

**What about children's privacy?**  
The Site is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not intend to collect information from any person under 13 years of age on the Site. Parents should not allow children to provide any such information. If we determine that a child has provided information in violation of this policy, we will delete that information as soon as practicable. If any parent or guardian becomes aware that any child has provided information, please send us an e-mail through the [Contacts](https://web.archive.org/web/20110427234034id_/http%3A//www.mindshift.com/contact.xhtml "Contacts") page so we can delete that information.

**What else should I know about my privacy?**  
Although the information you submit to mindSHIFT is not publicly available, you should use caution when submitting information in other online forums. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online in areas that are accessible to the public - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online in these forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Additionally, you should be especially careful to monitor your child's participation in chat areas or message boards, and should usually not let them disclose any personally identifiable information on such websites.
