                <h2>MOJANG.COM ACCOUNT TERMS</h2>

<p>These Account Terms cover the ways our websites mojang.com and minecraft.net (our “Website”) will be provided to you and may be used by you. It is important to us that all of the members of our community can enjoy using our Website, so we‘ve made these terms and conditions to set a few ground rules. We also want to make sure that people don‘t use our Website in a way which might have a bad impact on our games or our brand.</p>

<p>By visiting our Website, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions, which makes a legal agreement between us both. If you don‘t agree with these terms and conditions, you should stop using the Website.</p>

<p>If you are under 13 years of age, you should not use our Website.</p>

<h3>REGISTRATION, ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD</h3>

<p>The details you give us as part of the registration must be correct. You can change your registration details if they become out of date. If you deliberately tell us something that you know isn‘t true, and we end up in trouble or we lose money, we may hold you responsible. That means that you may have to compensate us for the damage you cause and what we have lost.</p>

<p>You might need to register with us to access all of the parts of our Website. The username and password that you create are private so you must keep them to yourself. If you let someone find out your username and password, and they do something bad with our website, we will hold you responsible. You should change your password if you think someone else knows what it is. If someone uses your password to do something on our Website that you don‘t like or that causes you harm, we can‘t be and aren‘t responsible.</p>

<h3>RIGHTS OF USE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h3>

<p>You are free to use our Website as long as you stick to these terms and conditions. You can only use this Website and its content for your personal use. You can‘t use our Website for commercial purposes, so don‘t try and make any money from the Website. Your permission to use this Website is personal to you, so you can‘t give it to anyone else.</p>

<p>Don‘t forget that we still own the Website and the content on it, but we are giving you a permission to use it. We want you to enjoy using our Website, but if we want, we can take away your permission to use our Website at any time for any reason.</p>

<h3>RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS</h3>

<p>You aren‘t allowed to hack, decompile or change our Website at all and you mustn‘t do so. This includes the code or any content or data. Basically, you should just leave it as it is. You also aren‘t allowed to create any software or content that mimics our Website. We really don‘t want any of our community to get confused about which is the official Website and which is a website which someone other than us operates.</p>

<p>Please don‘t use our Website in a way which we might think is offensive, immoral or illegal, or makes other people feel uncomfortable. We don‘t want our Website to be used in a way which upsets people.</p>

<p>You also aren‘t allowed to try to make money out of using our Website.</p>

<h3>FORUM AND COMMUNICATIONS</h3>

<p>If we are running a forum, we are just allowing members of our community to put their thoughts on our Website. It doesn‘t mean we agree with those thoughts, and we can‘t be held responsible for what people post on our Website.</p>

<p>If we happen to see a post that we think is offensive, we might take it down, but it‘s not our job to select or moderate all the posts people make. What we say about forums and posts also applies to anything which enables people to put any other content, views or material on our Website or send it to others using the Website.</p>

<p>If you are going to put something up on our Website, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation. The types of things you must not put on our Website include: posts that include racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that might damage our or another person‘s reputation; posts that include porn, advertising or someone else‘s creation or image; or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.</p>

<p>If you put something which you don‘t own onto or our Website, you could get us into a lot of trouble so please don‘t do it. If you post content on our Website, and we get sued by someone because the content infringes that persons rights, you will have to pay us back for any damage we suffer because we have been sued. Therefore it is really important that you only post content that you have created and you don‘t post any content created by anyone else.</p>

<p>If you post any content on our Website, you must (and by doing so you actually do) give us permission to use, copy, modify and adapt that content as part of our business. This permission must be irrevocable. You must also let us permit other people to use, copy, modify and adapt your content. If you don‘t want to give us this permission, then please do not post any content on our Website. Please think carefully before you post any content, because it will be made public and might even be used by other people in a way you don‘t like.</p>

<p>Watch out if you are talking to people on or through our Website. It is hard for either you or us to know for sure that what people say is true, or even if people are really who they say they are. You should always think twice about giving out information about yourself.</p>

<h3>LIABILITY</h3>

<p>When you use our Website, you use it ‘as is‘. This means that we are not making any promises to you about the standard or quality of our Website, or that our Website will be uninterrupted or error free. We only promise to provide our Website and any services with reasonable skill and care. This means that we aren‘t responsible for any losses you suffer as a result of your use of our Website.</p>

<p>If we have linked our Website to another website, it doesn‘t mean we have checked that website. It just means that we think it‘s interesting. We aren‘t responsible for websites linked to our Website.</p>

<p>The payment method and system is set out on our Website, but we might change it every once in a while and we can refuse any form of payment if we want. You must always pay in the currency set out on our Website, but your credit card company should be able to exchange your money if necessary. You credit card company might do security checks to make sure it is really you making the order.</p>

<h3>RETURNS, REFUNDS AND CANCELLATION</h3>

<p>If you can‘t use a game or a product because it doesn‘t work, let us know and we‘ll try to help you out.</p>

<p>The purchase of a game through our Website is a service that commences when the download of the game starts, following which you shall not be entitled to cancel your order for the game.</p>

<h3>ERRORS</h3>

<p>We do what we can to make sure all of the information on our Website is correct. However, sometimes there might be errors. We might also cancel or suspend a transaction if there has been an error.</p>

<p>Sometimes we run promotions. If we do, the main rules of the promotion are below. There might be other rules relating to a particular promotion, but we will tell you about them when we tell you about the promotion.</p>

<p>The main rules are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Only one promotion can be used at a time, and you can‘t use a promotion with another offer.</li>
	<li>Discounts are only valid until the date specified and they only apply to purchases made on the Website.</li>
	<li>Discounts are not refundable.</li>
	<li>We might cancel any promotion at any time.</li>
</ul>

<p>These Account Terms are subject to any legal rights you might have. Nothing in these terms and conditions will limit any of your rights that may not be excluded under law nor shall it exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence nor any fraudulent representation.</p>

<p>We can change these Account Terms at any time. We don‘t need to tell you about the changes for them to have effect, and the effect could be retrospective. You should check back here from time to time so you are aware of any changes to these Account Terms.</p>

<p>If you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Websites or games, that suggestion is made for free. This means we can use your suggestion in any way we want and we don‘t have to pay you for it. If you think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, you must tell us you expect to be paid before you tell us the suggestion.</p>

                <h2>GUIDELINES FOR THE NAME, BRAND AND ASSETS OF ANY OF OUR GAMES</h2>

<p>All of our games are really important to us and to our community, which means that lots of you want to use our Brands and the things around our games to do cool stuff. We‘re happy about that. Sometimes, however, people go too far and do things that make the community think that their products and services are connected with or endorsed by us or even produced by us. We are not happy about that. Especially when people do it deliberately to take unfair advantage of the community and our work in that way. When that happens, fans buy things thinking they are official which they are not. That means we can't control quality etc. which diminishes the value of the work we have done and the trust that our community have in what we do.</p>

<p>We don‘t want you to stop doing the cool stuff that you do and so these Guidelines are intended to help everyone understand what we consider to be fair and unfair use of our “Brands” and “Assets”. We've had some help from some lawyers and they will also help us if we need to take further steps to protect our rights but the purpose of these “Guidelines” is to give some clarity on what you can do without having to contact us (or our lawyers) - and what you mustn‘t do or else we (or our lawyers) will have to contact you. We hope you understand.</p>

<h3>GUIDELINES</h3>

<p>These Guidelines cover the use of our Brands and our Assets. For these purposes, therefore when we refer to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a Name what we mean is the name of any one of our games as well as any names which are confusingly similar to the names of any of our games;</li>
	<li>our Brands what we mean is any Names and the related logos and distinctive characteristics of any of our games;</li>
	<li>our Assets what we mean is the code, software, graphics, textures, sound and audio from any of our games and any videos or screenshots taken from or our games.</li>
</ul>

<p>These Guidelines apply in addition to and not in place of our Account Terms or EULAs. Please remember that we say in all of our EULA that we have one major rule about our games and that is: Do not distribute anything we've made – which means don‘t</p>

<ul>
	<li>give copies of our games to anyone else;</li>
	<li>make commercial use of anything we've made;</li>
	<li>try to make money from anything we've made; or</li>
	<li>let other people get access to anything we‘ve made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;</li>
</ul>

<p>unless we specifically agree to it or allow it under these Guidelines.</p>

<p>These Guidelines do not change that principle but are intended to help people understand what we expect and want.</p>

<p>Please also check back here from time to time because we will update these guidelines and provide further guidance.</p>

<h3>ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<p>The first thing to say is that there are the following Essential Requirements that apply to all use of the our Brands (which include any Names) and our Assets. If you are allowed to use any part of any Name, any of our Brands and / or any of our Assets then what you are doing MUST:

</p><ul>
	<li>NOT make people think that you or what your are doing is official; approved or endorsed by us; or associated or connected with us;</li>
	<li>NOT be unlawful, deceptive, obscene, harmful or disparaging;</li>
	<li>NOT adversely affect any of our Brands or any of our Assets;</li>
	<li>NOT include anything else around it that makes people think that you or what your are doing is official; approved or endorsed by us; or associated or connected with us;</li>
	<li>comply with the relevant Account Terms/EULA;</li>
	<li>sufficiently differentiate the use of any Name you are using from any other branding;</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the "Essential Requirements".</p>

<h3>WHAT YOU CAN DO</h3>

<h4>Non-Commercial Things</h4>

<p>We are very relaxed about things you do for yourself. Pretty much anything goes there - so go for it and have fun just don‘t distribute anything we've made etc.</p>

<p>We are also quite relaxed about other non-commercial things so feel free to create and share videos, screen shots, independently created mods (that don't use any of our Assets), fan art, machinima etc;</p>

<p>However if you want to use any Name in the title of a product that you distribute or service that you provide (even if it is for free) then you have to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>follow the Essential Requirements;</li>
	<li>do so in a way that honestly and fairly describes those things or the purpose of them; and</li>
	<li>ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar name) is not the first word and don‘t use any other aspect of any of our Brands or Assets as part of any related branding, including as or as part of any logo.</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies especially if you want to set up and run blogs, servers, community forums, fan sites, fan clubs, news groups, events and gatherings.</p>

<h4>Commercial Things</h4>

<p>We are less relaxed about commercial things. You may not therefore use any Names in or as the main name or title of commercial things.</p>

<p>You may use a Name as a secondary name or title if you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>do so because it is necessary to honestly and fairly describe those things or the purpose of them:</li>
	<li>follow the Essential Requirements;</li>
	<li>ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar name) is not the dominant element or the distinctive part of the complete name or title of what you are doing;</li>
	<li>don‘t use any other aspect of any of our Brands or Assets as part of any related branding, including as or as part of any logo.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help you we‘ve suggested the following examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"The Shaft – a Minecraft podcast" (we‘re cool with that).</li>
	<li>"Minecraft - the ultimate help app" (we‘re NOT cool with that)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may not make any other commercial use of any of our Brands or Assets for example you may not sell any merchandise that uses any of our Brands or Assets and you definitely may not use our Names as keywords or search tags for products that have no relationship with them.</p>

<p>We love the idea of people doing cool things with our games and sharing those things with the community. That's something we totally support and encourage. So please feel free to do so but please also make sure you don‘t go too far.</p>

<p>In addition to the Brand Guidelines above we also have the following Asset Usage Guidelines that are intended to help you and everyone else understand what we consider to be fair and unfair – what you can and cannot do.</p>

<h5>Commerical Usage Guidelines</h5>

<p>The One Major Rule still applies but we may make some exceptions and they will be listed here, in this policy.</p>

<p>In this policy we will also give some additional specifics of what you may not do. However if something is not mentioned here it involves making money using anything from Minecraft (or anything else we've made) please do not do it.</p>

<p>In addition to the specifics set out below, where we do allow you to do something you will always need to add a credit as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Minecraft ®/TM &amp; © 2009-2013 Mojang / Notch</strong></li>
</ul>

<h5>Videos and Screenshots</h5>

<p>You are allowed to put footage of our Game on YouTube or any other website. In fact, we like you doing so.</p>

<p>You may create, use and distribute videos of you playing or using our Game for any lawful reason provided that you don't make any money from them.</p>

<p>You may make money using your videos of our Game so, for instance by putting ads on them, as long as you also add your own unique content to the video, such as audio commentary. The amount you add must also be enough to make it fair and worthwhile for someone to pay for it or for you to make money from it. For example you couldn‘t just include your logo, web address or indent but you could add an audio commentary or your own music if you are creating a music video.</p>

<p>You may also make money using videos and screen-shots if it is covered by so called “fair dealing” or “fair use” exceptions to copyright, such as where it is for criticism and review, reporting current affairs etc. In each case, you will still need to add appropriate additional content and credits where applicable.</p>

<p>…more will follow as and when we decide what to add - so feel free to make requests.</p>

<p>If something isn‘t covered by these Guidelines that probably means we don‘t want you to do it. In any case if it isn‘t covered please don‘t do it without getting permission from us. You can contact us at brands at mojang.com. If something is specifically covered and permitted by these Guidelines, our Account Terms or EULAs applicable to any of our games then you don‘t need to contact us.</p>

                <h2 id="mojang-privacy-policy-">MOJANG PRIVACY POLICY </h2>
<p>It is important to us that your privacy and data are protected. Most importantly we would like you to know that we do not want to use your data unless it is ok with you. That is why we have made this privacy policy - so you can be clear on how we intend to use your data.</p>
<p>Please be aware that Mojang is now part of Microsoft.  When this policy says “we” or “our,” that means Microsoft, including Mojang and other controlled affiliates and subsidiaries.</p>
<p>This privacy policy forms a part of the terms of use of any of our websites (“Account Terms”) and the end user license agreement of our games (“EULAs”). When you agree to our Account Terms or EULAs you are also agreeing to this privacy policy, so it is important that you read it carefully. Agreeing with this privacy policy is a condition of the Account Terms and EULA. This means, therefore, that if you do not agree with our privacy policy, you may not be able to play our games or use features in them and you may not be able to use our websites or parts of them. Sorry about that but we have taken this approach because there are a lot of people playing our games and using our site and it would be very difficult for us to keep track of who does and who does not agree to us using their data. We also depend on this data to enable us to continue to develop our games and websites in an efficient way. We hope you understand.</p>
<p>Please also check back here from time to time because we will update this privacy policy every once in a while.  When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the policy.</p>
<h3 id="the-data-we-collect">THE DATA WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>When you register on one of our websites or buy one of our games, you will be asked to provide some information about yourself, such as your email address. You may also provide information about yourself, such as your name, when you use other parts of our website or games or when you contact us. When you use our website or games, we collect data about your visit. This includes traffic data, location data and communication data.</p>
<h3 id="our-use-of-cookies">OUR USE OF COOKIES</h3>
<p>We also use internet cookies to collect information (like statistics) about your visit. An internet cookie is a small file which is placed on the device you use to access our website. Cookies also help us to know when you come back – and help you get going from the same point you left (or thereabouts).</p>
<p>If you do not want us to place any cookies on your computer or other device, please change your browser settings so that your browser rejects cookies. You should be aware that, if you do this, some parts of our website may not work properly. If you keep using our website without changing your browser settings, we will take this as your consent to us using cookies.</p>
<p>Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third-party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you may view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-do-with-your-data">WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR DATA</h3>
<p>We may use your data to send you information about our games, or to inform you about using our websites. We may also use your data if we have to tell you about changes to our products or services, or if we have to let you know about things affecting our games, we may also get in touch with you.</p>
<p>The information we gather from cookies enables us to estimate the size of our community, to learn about how our community uses our website and games, to make the websites customisable and to remember you when you return to our website. This information enables us to understand how to improve our website and our games.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-data">SHARING DATA</h3>
<p>We may provide your data to another member of our group of companies, or to companies that we work with (such as payment providers like Skrill or PayPal). Generally, we will not provide your data to unrelated third parties but we might have to in some circumstances. For example, we may disclose your data in order to comply with a law or regulation, in order to protect our games, or if we get taken over.</p>
<p>We may make it possible for you to post information on our website, for example, in a forum. If you choose to post information on our website, you should think very carefully beforehand. The information you post will be made public and could be used by other people.</p>
<h3 id="children">CHILDREN</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent, except as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Parents may request to review the personal information of their children under 13, to have this information deleted, or to refuse to permit further collection or use of their children’s personal information by contacting us at <a href="https://account.mojang.com/terms#contact">https://account.mojang.com/terms#contact</a>.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-your-data">ACCESSING YOUR DATA</h3>
<p>You have the right to know about the information which we hold about you. If you would like to know what information we are holding, you should get in touch with us. If the information we hold about you is wrong, insufficient or irrelevant, then you have the right to make sure that it gets corrected or removed.</p>
<h3 id="storage-and-security-of-your-data">STORAGE AND SECURITY OF YOUR DATA</h3>
<p>The transmission of data on the internet is not totally secure. We will always do what we think is best to protect your personal data, but we cannot guarantee that the data you send us is totally safe. Although we use strict procedures and security to protect your data, the possibility that someone could get unauthorised access to your data cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>The data we collect may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Microsoft, Mojang or our affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbour Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbour Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland.
