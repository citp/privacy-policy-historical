Intuit Inc. is certified through TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal Programs. In order to obtain certification, Intuit disclosed its information privacy practices to TRUSTe for its review to ensure compliance with TRUSTe’s requirements. Our compliance with the TRUSTe program is viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal.

**Scope**

This Privacy Statement describes Intuit Inc.’s (Mint.com) and Intuit Mint Bills, Inc. (“Bill Payment Service”) (collectively referred to as “we”, “our”, or “us”), collection, use, disclosure, and protection of your personal information collected or provided through our websites and devices or applications (“Site”) and how we use personal information in connection with our services offered through the Site (“Services”). It applies to any Site where this Privacy Statement is referenced or linked to.

“Personal information” is information that identifies you and is associated with a specific person. Personal information does not include information that is anonymous, aggregated, or is no longer identifiable to a specific person.

By using our Site, Service, or providing us your personal information, you agree to this Privacy Statement and agree to be bound and abide by our Terms of Service found [here](https://web.archive.org/terms). If you do not agree with any term in this Privacy Statement, please do not provide us your personal information or use the Site.

Information we process may be transferred to, stored, and processed in, the United States or any other county in which Intuit or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain operations. By using and providing information to us through the Site or Service, you agree and consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information to any such country in order to provide the Site and Service.

Our Site and Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 or if you are not of a legal age to form a binding contract with Intuit. We do not knowingly collect personal information from these individuals.

**Information we collect**

We may collect the following categories of personal information about you through the Site, including but not limited to:

  * **Registration information:** When you register for a Service, you will be asked for basic registration information, such as an email address and password.
  * **Identification information:** You may also be asked to provide identification information to confirm your identity, including your first and last name, username, address, and phone number.
  * **Payment account information:** For certain Services, including our Bill Payment Service, you will be required to provide your checking account number and routing number. You may also be required to provide your credit card number, expiration date, and credit card security code if you wish to use your credit card to make payments through our Bill Payment Service.
  * **Third party credentials:** You may also enter in certain passwords, usernames, account numbers, and other account information for third party sites and Internet services ("Third Party Sites").
  * **Information from Third Party Sites:** In order to display information to you through a Service, we may collect, on your behalf, your account and other personal information from Third Party Sites that you register under your account via the Service. For example, if you register your Bank of America account with us, we will aggregate your Bank of America information via our Site in order to present it to you. If you choose to access bills online through our Services, we may store a PDF or HTML representation of your bills on our servers.
  * **Contests and surveys:** From time to time, you may be offered an opportunity to participate in a contest, survey, or other promotion. We may collect or you may submit information in connection with one of these promotions.
  * **Technical and navigational information:** We collect information about your interaction with our Site such as computer browser type, pages visited, average time spent on our Site, IP address, unique identifier of the device, operating system version and app version.
  * **Location information:** If you choose to use a location enabled Service, we may collect location information from your device and will notify you of this collection. You may control or disable the sharing of location information via your device setting and/or the Site.
  * **Other information:** We may request or receive other personal information such as feedback, questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas to provide you with other benefits or to improve upon the Service. In such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or decline that information.



**How we use the information we collect**

We use your personal information to:

  * fulfill your requests for certain products and Services;
  * respond to your inquiries about our Services;
  * analyze Site usage and improve the Services provided through the Sites;
  * alert you to software compatibility issues and to improve our web design and functionality;
  * deliver to you any administrative notices or alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Services;
  * offer you other products, programs, or services that we believe may be of interest to you;
  * perform market research, project planning, product development, troubleshooting problems, analysis of user behavior, marketing and promotions;
  * detect and protect against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity;
  * enforce our Terms of Service and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Statement; and
  * in connection with a merger, sale, of substantially all of our assets, or corporate reorganization.



In order to allow you to use certain Services, we may be required to verify your identity. To do so, we may, directly or through third parties, use information you provide to order a credit report or to verify information you provide against third party databases or through other sources. We may also use your information to verify your identity in the event you contact us for assistance with the Sites or Services.

In connection with the Bill Payment Service, we may use information you provide on your funding accounts to complete transactions you request via the Bill Payment Service, to verify the existence and condition of your funding accounts, or to assist with the posting of a payment with a payee. We may use information you provide regarding a payee if you ask us to assist with posting of a payment at such payee.

We may use your information to pre-fill form fields on the Sites for your convenience.

We may use the checking account and credit card information you provide to confirm your accounts are valid and to access funds from your accounts pursuant to your instructions in connection with our Bill Payment Service or in connection with payment for Services that you subscribe to.

We may use the information you provide to make payments on your behalf if you participate in our Bill Payment Service. For example, if you use our Bill Payment Service, we will use the information you provide about a third party that you receive bills from to verify the validity of your account with that biller and to route payments to that biller pursuant to your instructions, and we will use your payment account details to access the funds in your specified payment account in order to pay the bills that you request be paid to that biller.

We may use your payment account information to recommend the best payment source. For example, we may recommend that you use a specific credit card to pay a given bill because that card has the lowest APR.

We may use information you provide about Third Party Sites to provide the Services, which may include accessing the Third Party Sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you. When you use the Mobile Application or mobile versions of our Sites, we may collect the unique device identifier assigned to that device by phone makers, carriers, or makers of the operating system (the "Device ID"). Device IDs allow app developers, advertisers, and others to uniquely identify your device for purposes of storing application preferences and other data.

We may use your Device ID for security purposes. For example, if you have activated a feature that limits access to a Service from a specific device, our systems will access the Device ID from each device you attempt to access the Service with to determine if the device is the specific authorized device. Additionally, we may use Device IDs to monitor suspicious activity. For example, if we detect that a single account on a Site is being accessed from multiple devices, as determined by tracking the Device IDs that access an account, we may contact the user to ensure that such access has been authorized by the user.

**How we disclose personal information**

We will not, without your permission, sell, publish, or share your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.
