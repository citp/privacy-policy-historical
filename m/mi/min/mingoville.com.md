## Use of Cookies

The Mingoville Web site uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Mingoville pages, or register with Mingoville site or services, a cookie helps Mingoville to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as postal addresses, telephones, and so on. When you return to the same Mingoville Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Mingoville features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Mingoville services or Web sites you visit.

  


## Security of your Personal Information

Mingoville secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Mingoville secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as passwords) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

  


## Changes to this Statement

Mingoville will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Mingoville encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Mingoville is protecting your information.
