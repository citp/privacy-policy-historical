However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or any actions of any third parties who receive the information.  
7.2 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

The Information Commissioner is the UK's independent public body set up to protect personal information and provide information to individuals and organisations. Please see  **[www.ico.gov.uk](http://ico.org.uk/)**  for more information.

We will ensure that all personal information supplied by you to us is held and dealt with in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and its relevant subordinate legislation and we will comply with the principles set out in that Act. When you supply any personal information to us we will meet our legal obligations towards you in the way that we deal with that information. In accordance with the data protection principles we must collect personal information fairly and let you know how we will use it and whether we will pass the information on to anyone else. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not supply your personal information to third parties without your express prior consent other than as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will ensure that any information will be held only as long as is necessary to ensure that our service runs smoothly.  
8.3 The Data Protection Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
