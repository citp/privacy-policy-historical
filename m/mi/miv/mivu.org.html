You are free to visit our sites without providing personally identifiable information. However, if you would like to access our Services, in some cases you must first register or create an account or learning profile with MVU. When you register or create an account or learning profile, we will request certain personal information. Requests can include, but are not limited to, your name, address, city, state, zip code, county, e-mail address, age, home or other contact information, school contact information, gender, and parent/guardian contact information. In some cases, the sponsoring party funding your participation in the course (a "Sponsoring Party") may provide this or other information about you to us. We may use this information to create an account or learning profile and issue you an access ID and password. If you are paying with a credit card, we also will collect your credit card number (employing industry standard security and encryption technologies), billing information and e-mail address to process your payment. </p><p>Personal information better enables us to provide you with content relevant to your interests and provides us with aggregate demographic data that MVU uses to improve the services offered to users. Users may change their personal information at any time by using the provided interface once they are logged in and as often as necessary. If users are unable to log in and change their information themselves, they will be able to send an e-mail to mivuhelp at mivu dot org or contact us at the telephone number or address below for assistance.</p><p>In addition to registration, MVU may, from time to time, request personal information for purposes such as the provision of customer service, billing, network management, customer surveys, newsletter subscriptions, offers of related services, and other exchanges of information. Users may opt out of receiving future promotional mailings at any time. Please see below for User Options - Opt Out.</p><p>MVU gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users’ access most often. MVU automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users' access to our sites. We analyze these logs for sales and marketing purposes as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the overall, aggregate trends they reveal about out customers, not for the behaviors of individual users. </p><p><strong>Privacy of Children</strong></p><p>MVU's policy is to limit the collection of personal information from children in substantial agreement with the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”). Children ages 12 and under will not knowingly be allowed to register with MVU or create an account without their parent's permission. Before children ages 12 and under may participate in any Services requiring registration (e.g., creating or enrolling in a Course, chat rooms, message boards or other forums), the child's school must first obtain the parent's permission and that permission may allow us to collect and maintain the child’s information. If, at any time after a parent gives permission, the parent desires to review the child's personal information, request that it be deleted, or refuse to allow any further collection of the child's information, the parent may contact the school's representative for MVU or MVU with such a request. If you have additional questions regarding your child's use of his or her account, you may contact the school's representative or MVU. Please see below for our contact information. </p><p>MVU abides by COPPA and the regulations under it.&nbsp; You can obtain more information about COPPA from the Federal Trade Commission by clicking <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><strong>What MVU does with the information it collects</strong></p><p>The User ID you select during registration must be used to log in and participate in a Service or course. Once you log in to our Blackboard® site, you may be identified to the instructor and other students in that course by your full name in areas such as discussion forums, e-mail lists, Web conferences, and other places where participant names appear. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes available to the instructor and other students in that course. Blackboard® has a user assessable Directory feature.&nbsp; Anyone with a Blackboard® account can choose to share their Blackboard profile information in this Directory.&nbsp; You can turn on or off this feature once logged into Blackboard®. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p><p>MVU hosts, or provides links to, chat rooms, forums, and message boards. Our online instructors, instructor services, and student services staff monitor and respond to user e-mail sent to them and monitor and participate with users in threaded discussions and other online forums. MVU may monitor or edit the contents of a user's e-mail or threaded discussions or other online forums as required for normal maintenance of any of our Web sites or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on MVU; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of MVU; or (3) act to protect the personal safety of our guests or the public.</p><p>If you are a Michigan Virtual High School student, your grades in MVHS courses will be reported to your mentor and your school and/or Sponsoring Institution. Except as described in this statement, <strong><em>the personal information you supply to MVU will not be given, sold, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of MVU, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the Terms of Use, (iii) respond to claims that any content on our sites violates the rights of third parties, or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of MVU, its users, or the public.</em></strong></p><p>MVU may use aggregated personal information to determine the demographics of our users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about MVU. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that these demographics do not identify any specific user.</p><p>Certain non-personal information regarding users is recorded by the standard operation of the Internet servers hosting our sites. This information may be used to provide visitors to our sites with an enhanced, online experience. MVU may disclose aggregated user statistics, in order to describe the service to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. </p><p><strong>Cookies</strong></p><p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your computer when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited.&nbsp; A cookie can't read data from your hard disk or generally read cookie files created by other sites. MVU does not use cookies on its general access Web sites. In our Learnframe® Learning Management System cookies are used to manage a user’s learning sessions. These cookies are used to relay course progress from the user to our learning management system and contain only the session state, session ID and login ID. Our Blackboard® course management system uses cookies as a unique user and session identifier. These cookies are not “persistent,” which is to say that they are not permanently stored on the user’s computer. The Blackboard® cookie is destroyed when the browser session is closed. Our myDreamExplorer career site uses cookies to distinguish one user from another and to facilitate site navigation. The cookies contain only session state, session ID and login ID, and are destroyed when a user logs out or ends a browser session.&nbsp; In our Docent Managed Learning Environment, cookies are used to record session ID and user name and are destroyed when a user logs out and closes their browser.&nbsp; </p><p>If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you may receive the warning message with each cookie, depending on your browser’s functions. </p><p>Most or all browsers permit you to disable or reject cookies.&nbsp; You can do this by setting the preferences in the browser. Use the “help” feature of your browser to obtain more information about refusing cookies. As of the time we wrote this statement, there was information about how to manage cookies at the following websites.&nbsp; We do not operate either of these websites and we make no representation or warranty about the information contained in the websites to which these links will take you.</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3ben-us%3b283185">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3ben-us%3b283185</a><br><a href="http://wp.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html">http://wp.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html</a></p><p>Visitors to our Web sites always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences, but some of the Services, including course progress tracking, will not work if you have cookies disabled.</p><p><strong>Log Files</strong></p><p>We or our hosting provider may collect traffic information from visitors for statistical analysis and site improvement. When you accesses a site, we or our hosting provider may collect information about your visit in a log file on a server. Log file information may include, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.&nbsp; We or our hosting provider use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements in the aggregate, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses and other log file information are not linked to personally identifiable information. We do not try to track users or to identify users individually, but we or our hosting provider do review this information to understand overall trends and to determine what kinds of content are popular and useful to users.</p><p><strong>Outsourcing Providers</strong></p><p>We may use outside shipping or other outsourcing providers to process and ship orders or perform other functions.&nbsp; We require that these outsourcing providers not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes, except for backup and recovery operations. Although we use good faith efforts to ensure compliance by its outsourcing providers, we cannot, and will not, be responsible to users for misuse of personally identifiable information by such outsourcing providers.</p><p><strong>Specific Services</strong></p><p>We may have agreements with other parties to provide specific services. When you use such services, we may share personally identifiable information with such parties. In such cases, we will use good faith efforts to restrict the information provided to that which is necessary for the provision of such services.</p><p><strong>Supplementation of Information</strong></p><p>We sometimes supplement the information we receive from you with other information we receive from third party sources, such as credit card issuers or clearinghouses.</p><p><strong>User Options – Opt Out</strong></p><p>A user may opt to cease receiving future promotional mailings by sending an e-mail to: unsubscribe at mivu dot org and including his or her full name, User ID (if applicable), e-mail address, and the name of the mailing he or she no longer wishes to receive in the subject or message area. A user may also contact us at the telephone number or address below.&nbsp; <br>MVU reserves the right to send all users non-promotional e-mail related to business practices and systems operations, such as outage notifications and security warnings, even if the user has opted out of promotional mailings.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Visiting any of the Web sites and providing personal information sufficient to be able to e-mail information to you will be sufficient to create an existing business relationship with you for purposes of law regarding unsolicited commercial e-mail.</p><p><strong>Response Times</strong></p><p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely make any changes you request. Many such changes are accomplished using batch processing (i.e. collecting a number of similar change requests and making all such changes at once), so the changes may not be immediately effective. If you require an immediate change to your personally identifiable information and are unable to make such a change using the available site resources, please contact us using the information below.</p><p><strong>Links to Other Web sites</strong></p><p>You should be aware that when you are on our sites, you could be directed or provided with links to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you click a link to a content partner or affiliate of ours or to a site we have listed in one of our courses, the click takes you off our site. MVU is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of these non-MVU operated Web sites. Please note that these non-MVU operated Web sites' privacy policies may substantially differ from this statement. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy practices of any Web site before providing to them any personal information.</p><p><strong>Access to Your Information</strong></p><p>MVU offers users the ability to correct or change the information collected during registration or profile creation. Users may change their personal information at any time by using the provided browser interface, once they are logged in and as often as necessary. Remember that you may have to log in to multiple MVU hosted sites to correct or change your personal information depending on the different Services you have chosen to access. If a user is unable to log in and change his or her information him or herself, he or she should send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:mivuhelp@mivu.org">mivuhelp at mivu dot org</a>&nbsp;for assistance or contact us using the address or telephone number below.</p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>Our Web sites use security measures that we believe are reasonably designed to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Personal information is stored in a restricted access, secured database and only MVU staff or other authorized personnel supporting your enrollment or Services are authorized to have access to that database. MVU employs security measures and industry-standard encryption for all online purchases. All users are strongly advised to use Web browsers with 128 bit or better encryption features. To verify whether a Web page is encrypted and the level of encryption, use the following procedures, which were current when we wrote this statement.&nbsp; Internet Explorer® users right click over some regular text on the page, click on Properties, and then read the statement on the Connection line. Netscape Communicator® users right click on some regular text on the page, click on View frame info, and read the statement under the Security heading.</p><p>MVU has placed all of its Web and application servers inside of locked cages or rooms within commercial data centers.&nbsp; We deploy firewalls, intrusion detection, and other unpublished security measures to control access to personal data stored within our enterprise. If you have any concerns regarding the security of any MVU system, please send an e-mail to&nbsp;security at mivu dot org, and we will endeavor to reply to you within two business days. </p><p><strong>European Union Data Protection</strong></p><p>If you reside in or are a citizen of a member state of the European Union, by registering or creating an account to use the Services, you expressly agree that the personal information you provide may be transferred and stored in countries outside the EU, including the United States. <strong><em>If you do not agree to this statement, please do not use any of our sites or Services for which registration or account creation is required. </em></strong></p><p><strong>MVU Privacy Policy Statement Changes</strong></p><p>If MVU changes this privacy statement, we will post those changes on this Web site and the revised privacy statement will be effective immediately upon posting.&nbsp; <strong><em>By using any of our Web sites or Services, you agree to this change mechanism.&nbsp; If you do not agree to this change mechanism, please do not use our sites or Services.</em></strong> Your continued use of our sites or Services following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. </p><p><strong>Contact Michigan Virtual University</strong></p><p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement or the privacy practices of this Web site, please contact us electronically at&nbsp;privacy at mivu dot org or write to us or call us.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Director, Communication &amp; Public Relations<br>&nbsp;Michigan Virtual University<br>&nbsp;3101 Technology Parkway, Suite G<br>&nbsp;Lansing, MI 48910<br>&nbsp;(517) 324-5357</p><p>In the event that you are concerned about how data you have provided to MVU or one of its divisions through our sites and Services has been used, please contact us electronically at&nbsp;privacy at mivu dot org&nbsp;or write to the postal address listed above.<br><br></p></td><td valign="top"></td></tr></tbody></table>
