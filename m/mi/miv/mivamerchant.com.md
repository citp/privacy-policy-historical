We also automatically gather information about your computer, such as your IP address, your device type and its physical location (determined by satellite, WiFi signals, cell phone towers, etc.), browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system.

We may also receive your personal information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms and other third parties.

## Disclosure to Third Parties

We may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. See the Tracking Technologies section below for details.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We may disclose your personal information

  * As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; 
  * When we believe, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, enforce our terms and conditions, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
  * If Miva is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets; and
  * To any other third party, with your prior consent to do so.



## PayPal

If you choose to use PayPal to finalize and pay for your order, you will provide your credit card number, directly to PayPal. PayPal's privacy policy will apply to the information you provide on the PayPal website.

## Customer and Third Party Services 

This privacy policy does not apply to any third party services, or services provided to you by a customer of Miva.

We are not responsible for any third party's collection, use, or disclosure of your information, or the privacy and security policies or practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which our Websites or services may link. Such third party websites or services may include third party organizations such as social media platform providers, operating system providers, browsers, wireless services providers, and device manufacturers. The inclusion of a link on our Websites does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.

As a service provider to our customers, Miva does not explicitly collect, store, or utilize personal information that is entirely in the control of our customers and their end users who utilize the Miva Merchant software installed for a given customer on that customer's website. However, if a customer subject to EU law does set their store up in a manner that collects such data, at that point it would be stored on our servers in the United States, and possibly transmitted by our software to various third party services that the store administrator(s) may configure, such as payment or shipping services, fulfillment systems, etc. That control is left to our customers and their store administrators, and is not explicitly facilitated by Miva. Such data is not governed by this privacy policy, but may be subject to our customers' own privacy policies.

## Tracking Technologies

We, or a third party contracted by us, may use technologies such as cookies, Web beacons, or scripts to gather information about how you and others interact with our Websites, and which products and services may be of interest to you. For example, we will know how many users access specific areas or features within Miva Websites and which links or ads they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how Miva Websites are used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that may be of interest to you, through Miva Websites and other websites and online services, and on recognized devices you use. For the avoidance of doubt, we will only collect information regarding your activity on Miva's Websites, and will not track your activity across third party websites or applications. Please note that we do not respond to Do Not Track signals.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Therefore, please do not email unencrypted credit card information to us. We also ask that you not send or disclose to us, through our services or otherwise, any other sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, biometric data (for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person), data concerning health or a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation, or criminal background.

We provide two means for you to make a purchase on our site. You can either use our order form or a third party checkout option. If you use our shopping cart, the transmission of sensitive information collected on our order form is encrypted. If you choose to use a third party checkout option to pay for your order, its privacy statement and security practices will apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy statement before providing your information.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account, or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at [[email protected]](https://www.miva.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c4c4e554a5d5f457c51554a5d125f5351). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Other Information

Our Websites include third party hosted widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our Websites to provide single-purpose services (e.g. sharing of articles, videos, etc.). Personal information, like your email address, may be collected and cookies may be set so the widget can work properly. The information through the widget is subject to the widget provider's privacy policy. 

Our Websites offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [[email protected]](https://www.miva.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2555574c5344465c65484c53440b464a48). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so.

Our Websites and services are not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, individuals under the age of sixteen (16).

We may store or process your personal information in any country in which we have facilities or engage service providers, and by using our websites, social media pages, or services, you consent to transfer of that information to countries outside your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules.
