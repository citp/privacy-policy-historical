# Privacy Policy - Michigan Virtual

BY ACCESSING ANY OF OUR WEBSITES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND TERMS OF SERVICE. OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE MAY CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE TERMS DESCRIBED BELOW AND ALL CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE STATEMENT BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE OR PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION THROUGH ANY OF THE SITES LISTED BELOW.

This page describes the ways in which _Michigan Virtual™_ , a Michigan nonprofit corporation, and all of its divisions (collectively referred to here as “ _Michigan Virtual_ ,” “we,” “us” or “our”) handle information it obtains about individuals through the websites it operates, including:

michiganvirtual.org (and all sub-domains of michiganvirtual.org)  
mivu.org (and all sub-domains of mivu.org)  
mivhs.org  
mvlri.org  
micourses.org

We provide a variety of information, features, and functions (the “Services”) through these websites.

This page does not necessarily reflect the ways in which we collect and use information by means other than these websites. If you have questions about the ways in which we collect information by other means, please contact us using the contact information in this statement. The practices relating to persons with separate agreements with _Michigan Virtual_ or its affiliates are separately covered in those agreements.

### Information Michigan Virtual collects

The information we collect will depend on what you do when visiting our sites. EXCEPT AS STATED IN THIS STATEMENT, WE WILL NOT COLLECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU VISIT OUR SITES UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION TO US. You are free to visit our sites without providing personally identifiable information. However, if you would like to access our Services, in some cases you must first register or create an account or learning profile with _Michigan Virtual_. When you register or create an account or learning profile, we will request certain personal information. Requests can include but are not limited to your name, address, city, state, zip code, county, email address, age, home or other contact information, school contact information, gender, and parent/guardian contact information. In some cases, the sponsoring party funding your participation in the course (a “Sponsoring Party”) may provide this or other information about you to us. We may use this information to create an account or learning profile and issue you an access ID and password. If you are paying with a credit card, we also will collect your credit card number (employing industry standard security and encryption technologies), billing information and email address to process your payment.

Personal information better enables us to provide you with content relevant to your interests and provides us with aggregate demographic data that _Michigan Virtual_ uses to improve the services offered to users. Users may change their personal information at any time by using the provided interface once they are logged in and as often as necessary. If users are unable to log in and change their information themselves, they will be able to send an email to [customercare@michiganvirtual.org](mailto:customercare@michiganvirtual.org) or contact us at the telephone number or address below for assistance.

In addition to registration, _Michigan Virtual_ may, from time to time, request personal information for purposes such as the provision of customer service, billing, network management, customer surveys, newsletter subscriptions, offers of related services, and other exchanges of information. Users may opt out of receiving future promotional mailings at any time. Please see below for User Options – Opt Out.

_Michigan Virtual_ gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users’ access most often. _Michigan Virtual_ automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users’ access to our sites. We analyze these logs for sales and marketing purposes as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the overall, aggregate trends they reveal about our customers, not for the behaviors of individual users.

### Privacy of children

The _Michigan Virtual_ policy is to limit the collection of personal information from children in substantial agreement with the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA). Children ages 12 and under will not knowingly be allowed to register with _Michigan Virtual_ or create an account without their parent’s permission. Before children ages 12 and under may participate in any Services requiring registration (e.g., creating or enrolling in a course, chat rooms, message boards or other forums), the child’s school must first obtain the parent’s permission and that permission may allow us to collect and maintain the child’s information. If at any time after a parent gives permission, the parent desires to review the child’s personal information, request that it be deleted, or refuse to allow any further collection of the child’s information, the parent may contact the school’s representative for _Michigan Virtual_  with such a request. If you have additional questions regarding your child’s use of his or her account, you may contact the school’s representative or _Michigan Virtual_. Please see below for our contact information.

_Michigan Virtual_ abides by COPPA and the regulations under it. You can obtain more information about COPPA from the [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions).

### What does Michigan Virtual do with the information it collects?

The User ID you select during registration must be used to log in and participate in a Service or course. Once you log into our Blackboard site, you may be identified to the instructor and other students in that course by your full name in areas such as discussion forums, email lists, web conferences, and other places where participant names appear. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes available to the instructor and other students in that course. Blackboard has a user accessible directory feature. Anyone with a Blackboard account can choose to share their Blackboard profile information in this directory. You can turn on or off this feature once logged into Blackboard. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

_Michigan Virtual_ hosts, or provides links to, chat rooms, forums and message boards. Our online instructors, instructor services, and student services staff monitor and respond to user email sent to them and monitor and participate with users in threaded discussions and other online forums. _Michigan Virtual_ may monitor or edit the contents of a user’s email or threaded discussions or other online forums as required for normal maintenance of any of our websites or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  2. Protect and defend the rights or property of _Michigan Virtual_ _._
  3. Act to protect the personal safety of our guests or the public.

  2. Enforce the Terms of Use.
  3. Respond to claims that any content on our sites violates the rights of third parties.

_Michigan Virtual_ may use aggregated personal information to determine the demographics of our users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about _Michigan Virtual_. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that these demographics do not identify any specific user.

In accordance with Michigan’s State School Aid Act, _Michigan Virtual_ offers student courses as part of its effort to serve as a statewide laboratory and quality model of instruction for implementing virtual learning solutions. As such, it is possible that research will be conducted on a course in which students are enrolled or on students’ online experience. Non-personally identifiable data will be shared with researchers for these purposes. If for any reason a student does not want to participate in research activities or does not want his or her data to be used for research purposes, please send an email at any time to customercare@michiganvirtual.org. In that email, please include the student’s first and last name, the email address the student uses when signing into the Student Learning Portal, as well as a sentence indicating that the student does not want to participate in research activities. Please use “Research” in the subject line of the email. A student’s participation in research is voluntary and there is no penalty if a student does not want to participate.

_Michigan Virtual_ will abide by the student privacy guidelines set forth by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The following persons have access to student records:

  * _Michigan Virtual_ Board of Directors members.
  * President and CEO, the _Michigan Virtual_ administrative team and professional staff of _Michigan Virtual_.
