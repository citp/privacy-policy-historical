You hereby consent that we may process and disclose personal information to our affiliated companies (which are in the communications, social media, technology and cloud businesses), Third Party Service Providers (defined below) for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Here are more details on how we use your information (which may include personal information) -</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setting up your Mi Account</strong>. Personal information collected when creating a Mi Account on our web sites or through our mobile devices is used for creating the personal Mi Account and profile page for the user.</li>
<li><strong> Processing your purchase orders</strong>. Information relating to e-commerce orders may be used for processing the purchase order and related after-sales services, including customer support and re-delivery. In addition, the order number is used to cross check the order with the delivery partner as well as the actual delivery of the parcel. The receipt details, including name, address, phone number and postal code are for delivery purposes. The email address is used to send parcel tracking information to the user. The list of purchased item(s) is used for printing the invoice and allowing users to see what is in the parcel.</li>
<li><strong> Allowing you to participate in MIUI Forum</strong>. Personal information in relation to the MIUI Forum or other Xiaomi Internet platforms may be used for profile page display, interaction with other users, participating in the forum.</li>
<li><strong>Providing Mi Cloud and other MIUI services</strong>. Information (device or SIM card-related information including IMEI number, IMSI number, phone number, device ID, device operating system, MAC Address, device type, system and performance information and location information including mobile country code, mobile network code, location area code and cell identity) is collected for activating MIUI services, e.g. Mi Cloud, call log sync, SMS sync, Find Device, for the purposes of user authentication and activation of the services.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnosing activation failures</strong>. Location related information is used for the purpose of assessing SIM card activation failure (i.e. failure of SMS gateway and network) to identify the network operator of that service, and notify the network operator of that failure.</li>
<li><strong> Providing other MIUI services</strong>. Other information collected for each of the MIUI services may be used for performing the functions of that service, and to facilitate the provision of that service for the benefit of the user, e.g. downloading, updating, registering or performing activities related to MIUI services. For example, personal information collected by the Theme Store may be used to provide personalised theme recommendation services based on your downloading and browsing history.</li>
<li><strong>Finding your device</strong>: Xiaomi’s Find Device feature helps you find and secure your phone if it is lost or stolen. You can locate your phone on a map using location information provided by your phone, wipe your phone, or lock your phone.  We may collect your location data directly from your mobile device, or in some situations, from cell towers or Wi-Fi hotspots. </li>
<li><strong>Recording location information in photos</strong>. You have the ability to record your location information while taking a photo. This information will be visible within your photos folder and the location will be put into the header of your photos.  If you do not wish to have your location recording while taking a photo, you may turn this off at any time within the camera settings of the device.</li>
<li><strong>Providing messaging functions (e.g. Mi Talk, Mi Message)</strong>. If you download and use Mi Talk, information collected for Mi Talk may be used for activating this service and identifying the user and message recipient. In addition, chat history is stored for the convenience of re-loading historical chats after a user has re-installed apps, or for synchronisation across devices. Information (sender’s and recipient's phone numbers and Mi Message IDs) may be used for Mi Message for activating the services and enabling the service to function, including routing of messages.</li>
<li><strong>Providing location based services</strong>. In the course of using MIUI services, location information may also be used by us or Third Party Service Providers to serve you the correct version of the service and provide accurate details about that location for the best possible user experience, e.g. weather details, location access (as part of the Android platform). You may turn this off at any time by going into the device settings or discontinue use of that application.</li>
<li><strong> Improving user experience</strong>. Some opt-in features, such as the User Experience Program, allow Xiaomi to analyse data about how users use the mobile phone and MIUI services, so as to improve the user experience, such as sending crash reports.</li>
<li><strong>Allowing you to use Security Centre</strong>. Information collected may be used for security and system up-keeping functionalities in the Security Centre, such as advertising blocker, virus scan, power saver, blocklist, cleaner, etc. Some of these functionalities are operated by Third Party Service Providers. Information (which is not personal information like virus definition lists) is used for virus scan functions.</li>
<li><strong>Providing Push Service</strong>. Mi Account ID and IMEI numbers will also be used to provide the Xiaomi push service to evaluate advertising performance and send notifications from MIUI about software updates or new product announcements, including information about sales and promotion. You may opt out of this at any time through changing your preferences under "Settings".</li>
<li><strong>Verifying user identity</strong>. Xiaomi uses the ECV value to verify the user identity and ensure there is no log-in by hackers or unauthorised persons.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting user feedback</strong>. The feedback you choose to provide is valuable in helping Xiaomi make improvements to our services. In order to follow up on the feedback you have chosen to provide, Xiaomi may correspond with you using the personal information that you have provided and keep records.</li>
<li><strong> Sending notices</strong>. From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.</li>
<li><strong>Conducting promotional activities</strong>. If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion, e.g. via Xiaomi’s Facebook page or other social media platforms, we may use the personal information you provide to administer those programmes.</li>
</ul>
