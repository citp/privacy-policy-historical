Some of our interactive pages may invite visitors to submit names or e-mail addresses in order to join a mailing list or submit comments.

In addition, we may use your information in order to respond to your comments or requests for information. 

MPI does not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease any of your personally identifiable information collected at our website to any outside entity. However, nothing in the Privacy Statement shall be deemed to prohibit MPI from disclosing your identity if MPI is required to do so by law.
