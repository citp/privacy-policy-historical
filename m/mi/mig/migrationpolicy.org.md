# MPI and MPI Europe Privacy Policy | migrationpolicy.org

Commitment to Privacy

The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) and its Brussels-based sister organization, MPI Europe, respect the privacy of every individual who uses this website or sends us email. This privacy policy outlines the information we will collect and how we will use it. By your use of our website, you signify that you consent to the terms of this privacy policy.

### Personally Identifiable Information

When you visit [www.migrationpolicy.org](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/), we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily.

Some of our interactive pages invite visitors to submit names and email addresses in order to join a mailing list. If you opt not to provide us with this information, no material consequences will result, although you may be unable to receive certain information we send out electronically. Parties wishing to join the mailing list are required to provide a variety of necessary and personally identifiable information, such as name, address, phone number, and email address.

### Use of Personally Identifiable Information

We may store and process personally identifiable information to better understand your needs and improve our website, and to contact you uniquely for MPI or MPI Europe business. For example, at your request, we may send you event invitations, news or research updates, or other notices. In addition, we may use your information in order to respond to your comments or requests for information. We may retain and use personally identifiable information for the purpose you specify until that purpose has been met or, in the case of electronic mailings and event notifications, until you opt out of such communications using the steps outlined in the next section.  

We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease to any outside entity any of the personally identifiable information you have shared in any capacity, online or offline. MPI, on its behalf and that of MPI Europe, acts as a data controller, as defined by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To conduct outreach to users who request to join mailing lists or receive other communications from us, we use an external service provider; because this service provider is based outside the European Economic Area, the data we collect for outreach are also stored outside the European Economic Area. Safeguards are in place to protect the data collected, stored, and used in this fashion.

We will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. We also will release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of security or a physical threat to you or others.

### Contacting Us Regarding Your Personally Identifiable Information

You have the right to ask for a copy of the information we have about you. If you have submitted personally identifiable information through this website or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information through this website and you would like to have that information corrected or deleted from our database, please contact us at the below address. We then will use reasonable efforts to remove your personally identifiable information from our files. You may also click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

You can learn more about cookies and how to control them on our [**Cookie Policy**](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/about/cookie-policy) page.

### Security

We have put in place, and regularly review and update, appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use any personally identifiable information collected. If you choose to make a donation to MPI or MPI Europe or pay for a service (such as a book purchase or conference attendance fee), we require certain personally identifiable information from you. We encrypt this information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.

### No Liability for Acts of Third Parties

Although MPI and MPI Europe will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, transmissions made by means of the internet cannot be made absolutely secure. MPI and MPI Europe will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.
