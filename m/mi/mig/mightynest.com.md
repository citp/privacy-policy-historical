## MightyNest Privacy Policy Last Updated May 23, 2018

MightyNest is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy addresses how MightyNest Inc. collects and uses information you provide. By visiting MightyNest.com, and providing your information to us, you agree to accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

MightyNest.com is built with features designed to protect information that we obtain from you and utilizes relevant encryption software and other safeguards to ensure our e-commerce site is safe. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information.

  
**What Information is Collected**  
The information we collect during use of MightyNest.com is grouped into two categories: personal information, which is information that is identifiable to a specific customer, and aggregate information, which is general information that does not identify an individual customer. Personal information may include your name, email address, mailing address, credit card information and phone number.  MightyNest does not store any credit card information directly on our servers. Other personal information you may share with us if you choose to complete a subscriber profile includes items such as birthday, green living preferences (e.g. vegan, preferred fragrances, etc), and details about your home (e.g. have pets). We may also collect certain demographic information such as your Site preferences, household information, age, gender, geographical location, language, time zone, income and education (some of this information may be optional). MightyNest may use or disclose aggregate information for any purpose.

  
**How We Use Your Information**  
We collect personal information to make our services related to this Site (the “Services”) more rewarding for you to use, including recommending products, selecting surprise subscription items, billing, shipping and tracking your orders. If we have any questions or concerns regarding your order, we may use this information to contact you. We also use this information for internal purposes, such as studying our customers’ preferences and improving customer experience on the Site. We may also use your information to contact you for promotional purposes and provide customer service to you. If you enter into a sweepstakes, contest or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those activities. We may combine information about you with information from other sources in order to improve the quality of our Services.

We also receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information, which is collected passively using various technologies, and cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve you, we often conduct research on customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the personal and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. We may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

You may receive periodic emails from us with information on new products, specials, or upcoming events. If wish to be removed from our mailing list, please let us know by emailing customerservice@mightynest.com with your full name and email address.

If you are a member of one of our subscription services, you may also receive periodic emails from us with information about the products you received in your subscription box, reminders of upcoming orders processing dates, and the seasonal specials reserved for members. If you wish to be removed from these notifications, please let us know by emailing customerservice@mightynest.com with your full name and email address.
