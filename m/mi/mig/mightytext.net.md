### Information Collection & Use

We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time.

**Information Collected Upon Registration:** When you create or reconfigure a MightyText account, you provide some personal information, we may collect information such as your name, email address, and contacts info through connecting to your Google Account (with your consent). This information is not displayed to the public nor is it ever shared without your explicit consent. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or alert you to important events. If you contact us via email, our help desk, or other electronic communication, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.

**Text Messages, Notifications, Media:** Our Services are primarily designed to help you communicate and share information privately with whom you choose. None of the information is ever made public, unless you explicitly opt-in for that.

**Log Data:** Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, phone type, the referring domain, pages visited. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.

**Links:** MightyText may keep track of how you interact with links in Updates by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.

**Cookies:** Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, and to authenticate users. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. MightyText may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Third party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to MightyText's website or other websites. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

**Advertising:** Our Services are supported by advertising. We may use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, and to measure its effectiveness. We do not use the private SMS text message content, notification content, or multimedia content that you send or have synchronized to serve you ads. 

**Third Party Services:** MightyText uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.

### Information Sharing & Disclosure

We do not disclose your private information except in the limited circumstances described here.

**Your Consent:** We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your MightyText account.

**Service Providers:** We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.

**Law and Harm:** We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect MightyText's rights or property.

**Business Transfers:** In the event that MightyText is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.

**Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:** We may share or disclose aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage patterns or link click statistics

### Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information

If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.

### Updates to Our Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will be at https://mightytext.net/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via your MightyText client or to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
