###### Last updated: July 24, 2013

* * *

### OUR POLICY

Welcome to mightybell.com a web application made available by Mighty Software, Inc. (“Mightybell”, “we,” “us,” or “our”). We created this privacy policy to provide information about our company and its services that provide circles (“Circles”) to online groups for specific interests (together with our web application, the “Service”) to our users (“you,” or “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Mightybell’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”), and other information that is collected from visitors to our Application and users of the Service. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms of Use.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

When you interact with us through the Service, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

Personal Data That You Provide Through the Service: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to the Service (for example, name and email address) whether directly through the Service or through an Integrated Service (as defined below), use certain features of the Service, contact us with inquiries, or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever Mightybell collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. If you are a User, you agree to comply with this Privacy Policy. However, as a member of Circles, you acknowledge that Mightybell cannot control the actions of other Users; if you have a privacy-related dispute with an User, you should contact the User directly.

By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our storage, use and disclosure of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred by or on behalf of Mightybell from your current location to the offices and servers of Mightybell and the authorized third parties referred to herein, whether or not located in the United States.

Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data: When you interact with Mightybell through the Service, we may collect, receive, and store certain personally non-identifiable information (including your age and location that you provide). Such information, which is collected passively by or on behalf of us using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Mightybell may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Mightybell business partners, affiliates, agents, or service providers. The Service may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Service or our business partners’ services, the total number of Users who join Circles, how Users find and join Circles, the number of visitors to each page of our Service or our business partners’ services, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our Users use and interact with the Service or our business partners’ services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the Users of the Service, Mightybell often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Mightybell may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its Users, affiliates, agents, and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. Mightybell may also disclose aggregated User statistics in order to describe our Service to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

Location Information: We, directly or indirectly via our business partners, may collect your location information (for example, by using the GPS on your mobile device) to provide certain functionalities. If you choose to enable location features, other users of our Services may be able to see your location, and Mightybell may also share your location information with its affiliates, agents, and business partners in connection with your use of the Service or their services.

In operating the Service, we, along with our third-party partners, may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Service or our partners’ service gives to your browser when you access the Service. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Service and help us analyze Service usage more accurately. For instance, our Service may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Service without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once when you are using the Service. In all cases in which we or our business partners use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service’s features.

We, along with third-party partners, may use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Service. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies. Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls. 

We, along with our third-party partners, may also use technologies called web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the web beacon was viewed. We and our partners use web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of our Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

### OUR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION

Mightybell uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Service (including through any Integrated Services), we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Mightybell and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Service to help us improve the content and functionality of the Service, to better understand our users and to improve the Service. Mightybell and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Service or to tell you about products or services that we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. Note however that as a User of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications.

If Mightybell intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

### OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION

Mightybell is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

Searching and Messages by Other Users: Hosts of Circles or other users of the Service may be able to search you by your name, user ID, location, interests, or other Personal Data so that they may identify prospective members of their Circles. Hosts or other users may send you private messages through the Service.

Use of Circles: If you participate in a Circle created by another user of the Service, the Host may have access to certain Personal Data that you make generally available through the Service, such as your username, gender, age, location, and activity in their specific Circle in which you are participating. The Host may also receive aggregate usage data related to your participation in a Circle, such as when you accomplish an action in such Circle and how you rated it. If you are a Host of a Circle, unless you opt-out of making that Circle available for searching by other users, your Circle, your name, and user ID, along with the names and user IDs of the other members of your Circle, may be made available for searching by other users. This enables users to identify Circles that might be of interest to them and to contact the Host of that Circle to request to join the Circle. If you are a member of a Circle that is searchable by other users of our Services, then your name and user ID may be shared with any users searching that Circle through our Services.

Readers of your User Content: When you submit User Content (as defined in our Terms of Use) via our Services or otherwise to us, you may have chosen to include certain Personal Data or other information about you within that User Content. For example, you may have chosen to reveal your name, age, location, or other biographical information in the context of telling a story about yourself. In that case, whenever we share your User Content with our other users, licensees, or business partners in accordance with the rights you have granted to us regarding that User Content as described in the Terms of Use at mightybell.com/terms_of_use, we also share whatever Personal Data or other information you chose to include within that User Content.

We also may share your Personal Data or other information with our licensees, business partners, and other third parties in connection with their publication or other distribution or use of any of your User Content in accordance with the rights you have granted to us pursuant to our Terms of Use. For example, we may share your name, location, and biographical information that you chose to include within your User Content so that it may be published along with that User Content.

Integrated Services: We also may share your information with the operators of any Integrated Services (as defined below), as more fully explained in the sections below entitled “Integrated Services.”

Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.

Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Mightybell, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.

Legal Requirements: Mightybell may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Mightybell, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

### YOUR CHOICES

Note that although you may be able to set your participation in a Circle as non-visible to others, other members in a Circle will be able to see that you are participating.

In addition, Hosts of Circles may be able to opt-out of making their Personal Data and information about their Circle available for searching by other users through the privacy settings we make available to Hosts through our Service.

You can access the Service without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain features of the Service.

If we send you emails about services that may interest you, each email will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing or other communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing or other communications, please contact us at help@mightybell.com. At times, Mightybell, together with its business partners, may also send co-branded emails to you. The opt-out instructions on these co-branded emails will state whether the opt-out applies solely to future emails from Mightybell, its business partners, or both.

### EXCLUSIONS

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Mightybell other than Personal Data collected through the Service. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Mightybell through the Service or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Service, such as public forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Mightybell shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute, and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.

### CHILDREN

Mightybell does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data through the Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Mightybell through the Service, please contact us and we will look to delete that information from our databases.

### LINKS TO OTHER WEB APPLICATIONS

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. The Service may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Mightybell (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Service do not imply that Mightybell endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

### INTEGRATED SERVICES

One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable various online third party services, such as social media and social networking services like Facebook and Twitter (each, an “Integrated Service”), to integrate directly into your Mightybell Circle. By directly integrating these services, we make your use of Mightybell richer, and more personalized. To enable Integrated Services, we may ask you to authorize Mightybell to access the Integrated Services (or vice versa). When you add an Integrated Service account to the Service (or vice versa), your log-in information, Personal Data, Non-Identifiable Data, location information, User Content, Circle names, Circle IDs, Circle locations, partner affiliations, and other relevant information necessary to enable the Service and Integrated Service may be passed through to, or received from, the Integrated Service in connection with your use of the Service. We may import, use, disclose, and retain such data and information to, among other things, customize and improve the Service for you, your friends, and others. Note that Integrated Services may also import, use, and retain this information. You may be able to control how certain information is shared with us in your privacy settings within the Integrated Services. However, please remember that the manner in which Integrated Services collect, use, store, and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of the third parties operating those Integrated Services, and Mightybell shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Integrated Service that may be enabled within the Service.

From time to time, we may share your information with Integrated Services. This may happen when you first register with Mightybell, when you log into Mightybell from time to time, or in emails or other communications we may send you consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may from time to time share your Personal Data and Non-Identifiable Data, your location information, your partner affiliation, your Community URL, your location, and your use of certain features on Mightybell with Integrated Services to facilitate and enhance your use of the Integrated Services. Please keep in mind that services provided by Integrated Services are not provided by Mightybell and therefore your use of the Integrated Services will be governed by the Integrated Services' Terms of Use and other policies, and that the collection, use, and disclosure of information provided by you or us to Integrated Services is not governed by this Privacy Policy.

### SECURITY

Mightybell takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email, or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.

### OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Your access to and use of the Service is subject to the Terms of Use at https://mightybell.com//terms_of_use.

### CHANGES TO MIGHTYBELL’S PRIVACY POLICY

The Service and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Mightybell to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Mightybell reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Service after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.

Mightybell has no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Integrated Service that may be enabled within the Service.
