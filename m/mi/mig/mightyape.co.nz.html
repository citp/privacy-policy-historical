</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION</h3>

<ol class="alpha">

<li>
<h3>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<ol>
<li>We may share your personal information with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in the Companies Act 1993.</li>
<li>We may share your information with selected third parties including:
<ol class="alpha">
<li>Our credit card and debit card payment processing agents. We know how important it is to protect the security of your credit and debit card information. For that reason, we have contracted leading payment services agents to store those details securely. When you provide us with your card details, and if you instruct us to save your card details for future transactions, we retain only part of those card details, before sending them to our payment services agent using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts the card details while they are transmitted. Our payment services agents will then securely store your card details in accordance with their own security protocols, and electronically confirm to us each time that you wish to make a transaction if your existing card details held by them are still valid. Sharing your card details in this manner helps us ensure that your card details are securely stored at all times and that once transmitted we do not hold your card details.</li>
<li>Business partners, suppliers and subcontractors who we engage to perform functions on our behalf. They will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. They must also process the personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy and as permitted by applicable data protection laws;</li>
<li>Advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach their target audience. We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience;</li>
<li>Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site; and</li>
<li>Credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
<ol class="alpha">
<li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
<li>If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets (but will continue to be subject at all times to any pre-existing commitments to you regarding privacy).</li>
<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our&nbsp;<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115012110928-Terms-Conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND HOW WE PROTECT IT</h3>
<ol>
<li>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside New Zealand. It may also be processed by staff operating outside New Zealand who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>All information you provide to us is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) before being stored on our secure servers. Our servers may be located in New Zealand or elsewhere, and may be operated by us or our contractors but regardless will only be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and under strict obligations requiring them to keep your information confidential.</li>
<li>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone and that you do not use the same password on a different website or application.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
<ol>
<li>You can always choose not to provide us with any information, or to disable Cookies (as discussed in our Cookies Policy), though this may affect your ability to access or use our Website or any particular features of it, and we may not be able to process transactions with you.</li>
<li>Our Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.

You should check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy as they will take effect from the date posted on our Website. We stand by our promises regarding your information, however, and will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of your information which we have already collected in the past without your consent.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>HOW WE RESPOND TO ‘DO NOT TRACK' SIGNALS</h3>
<ol>
<li>As noted in our Cookies Policy, you can change settings on your device or browser to disable the use of Cookies and the other similar technologies we use.</li>
<li>If we receive a “Do not Track” Signal from you, we will cease to use all cookies other than “strictly necessary cookies” which apply to any features of our website or Services we offer. You will then be advised whether any feature of our website which you attempt to use or access will not correctly operate without additional tracking or cookies being enabled for any reason.</li>
