		<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
		<h2>Introduction and Scope</h2>

		<p>In this Privacy Policy, we (Project Goth, Inc.,
			headquartered in Singapore) describe how we use personally
			identifiable information about you that we collect through our website at&nbsp;
			<a href="http://mig.me" '="">mig.me</a>, through our migme software,
			through your use of our platform services, and through our
			customer support, <a href="mailto:contact@mig.me">contact@mig.me</a>. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any
			other data, including, without limitation, data that we collect offline about
			our customers, data about our employees or data that others collect on websites
			that are linked to our website.</p>

		<h2>About Children</h2>

		<p>This website is for adults only. In particular, it is not
			intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
			personally identifiable information via this website from visitors in this age
			group. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the
			Internet and the information they disclose to websites.</p>

		<h2>Advertising</h2>

		<p>migme displays targeted advertisements.</p>

		<ul>

			<li>When an advertiser
				books an ad placement in migme, they are given the opportunity to choose their
				audience by location, demographics, gender and any other non-personally
				identifiable information we receive or collect from you.</li>

			<li>We do not sell,
				trade or rent personally identifiable information about our users to advertisers,
				without our users' consent. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you
				are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser may make the assumption
				that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. Please note that this Privacy Policy in
				no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information
				which is data we collect about your use of our website or about a group or
				category of services or users, from which individual identities or other
				personally identifiable information has been removed.</li>

			<li>migme may use cookies, web beacons or other technologies to
				record information about what ads your browser is shown, as well as what ads
				you click on and other actions you take on our website and services.</li>

			<li>Advertisers may
				sometimes place their own cookies on your computer in order to make their ads
				more effective.</li>

			<li>Please remember
				that any personal information you provide on the linked pages, ads you click on
				or other websites is subject to a third party's privacy policy. This Privacy Policy
				does not apply to such linked websites, ads you click on or other website, and
				we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and
				policies of these websites or any other websites that are linked to from our
				website. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices
				and policies before providing them with personal information.</li>

			<li>Also, third party ad
				networks may serve ads on our website or provide ads via our services and/or
				otherwise place cookies, web beacons or other devices or technologies on our
				website (or via our services) to enable them to automatically collect non-personal
				information about you and your visits to our website and to other websites,
				your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit our website and
				other websites. Information collected may be used, among other things, to
				analyze data, to deliver content and advertising on our website or other
				websites (including content and advertising that is targeted to your
				interests), to determine the popularity of certain content, and to better
				understand the usage and visitation of our website and the other websites
				tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we
				are not responsible for, cookies or clear GIFs in third party ads, and we
				encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services
				to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies. If you would
				like more information about this practice and your choices as it relates to ad
				networks, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Types of Data We Collect,
			Collection Methods, Combination of Data</h2>

		<p>Through the website, we receive data that you actively
			submit and data that we track passively.</p>

		<p><b>Actively Submitted Data:</b> You actively send
			information to us if and when you sign up with us a user, register for our
			Merchant Program, respond to us or otherwise contact us. Depending on your
			choices, you may send us personally identifiable information such as your email
			address, name, mailing address, phone number, date of birth, gender, password,
			as well as credit card information.</p>

		<p><b>Passively Tracked Data:</b> When you visit the website, we also track information about
			how our website is used by you through "cookie" technology. Cookies
			are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard
			disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies save your passwords, purchases, and
			preferences while you are using our website. The use of cookies is common on
			major websites and most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You may set
			your browser to refuse cookies but this may mean that you will not be able to
			take full advantage of the features available on our website. We also collect
			information regarding your use of our service, including calling records and
			records of messages sent and received.</p>

		<p><b>Combinations:</b> Unless you also actively submit personal information such as
			your name or address, passively tracked data does not typically allow us to
			identify you personally (even though it can theoretically be done, we do not
			have the means or an interest to find out who you are unless you identify
			yourself voluntarily through an active submission of data). However, to the
			extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to combine passively
			tracked data with personal data that you actively submit.</p>

		<h2>Purposes of Data Collection</h2>

		<p>We collect information from you so that we can manage and
			administer the services we provide to you; administer your account; respond to
			your questions; solve any technical support problems; communicate with you
			about any modifications, upgrades or enhancements to our service; determine
			what sorts of services are likely to be most useful for you and to further
			develop our understanding of customers' needs; ensure your compliance with
			our&nbsp;<a data-ajax="false" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>; and carry
			out a statistical analysis of the use of our service.</p>

		<h2>Disclosure of Data</h2>

		<p>We keep your personally identifiable information
			confidential and we disclose it only as follows:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Our employees and independent contractors have access to some of your data,
				including your personally identifiable information, for the purpose of
				helping us run our business. They access and use data subject to our
				instructions, on a "need to know" basis and under
				confidentiality and security obligations.</li>
			<li>We may share data with affiliated companies.</li>
			<li>We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers and
				other business partners, which we engage and obligate to process your data
				only on our behalf or on behalf of joint purposes, e.g., in support of
				delivering information, products or services to you.</li>
			<li>We may also share your personally identifiable information to respond to law
				enforcement requests, court orders or other legal process or if we believe
				that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or respond to
				illegal activities, fraud, physical threats to you or others or as
				otherwise required by any applicable law or regulation.</li>
			<li>We may share or transfer your information in connection with a prospective or
				actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of
				our business.</li>
			<li>We freely use and disclose data received in anonymous form.</li>
			<li>Before we disclose your personally identifiable data for other reasons, we will
				first obtain your consent, for example via email, click-through, an online opportunity to opt-out or otherwise.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Security</h2>

		<p>We take reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable
			information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration,
			or destruction. But, you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is
			ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, messages sent to or from
			this website may not be secure.</p>

		<p>It is important that you maintain the confidentiality of any
			password, PIN or other ID check information in order to keep your personally
			identifiable information secure. Please notify us as soon as possible if you
			suspect that there is any unauthorized use of your account or there is any
			other breach of security.</p>

		<h2>Access to information</h2>

		<p>If you would like to know what personal information we hold
			about you or if you would like to correct any of the information that we hold,
			please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@mig.me">contact us</a>.</p>

		<h2>Opt-Out, Communication Preferences</h2>

		<p>You may modify your communication preferences and/or opt-out
			from specific communications at any time. Please specify and adjust your
			preferences by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@mig.me">contact@mig.me</a>.</p>

		<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

		<p>This Privacy Policy is effective August 31, 2007. We reserve
			the right to amend it from time to time and if we change it materially, we will
			post a revised version on this website. Please check back periodically, and
			especially before you provide any personally identifiable information to us.</p>

		<h2>Terms of Use</h2>

		<p>Note also that your use of our website is subject to
			our&nbsp;<a data-ajax="false" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, which
			contain disclaimers, limitations of liability, a choice of California law, and
			consent to the jurisdiction of State and federal courts in California.</p>

			complaints or suggestions you might have regarding the information practices
			described in this privacy policy. You may send us an e-mail
