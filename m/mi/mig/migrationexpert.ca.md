We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can divulge the identity of our clients. 

We share customer information only as described below:   


  * **With subsidiaries or associated companies** of migrationexpert.com that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
  * **Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  * **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of migrationexpert.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address.
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or subsidiaries. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that migrationexpert.com, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
