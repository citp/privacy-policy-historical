Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you've activated blocking technology available in some browsers. When you visit this Website or advertisements appearing thereon, or use one or more of this Website services, we may use an industry-wide technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on your computer and which will allow us to customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences, or to simply facilitate your signing in to use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not be able to restore any preferences or customization settings you previously specified, and our ability to personalize your online experience would be limited. Please refer to your browser instructions or "help" screen to learn more about these functions. <br><br>Also, MiTAC or third parties on its behalf, may collect information from visits to our websites through the use of "Web Beacons."
