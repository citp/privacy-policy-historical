                            <ul>
                                <li>Cookies:  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser.

                                <li>To improve our marketing and promotional efforts (such as sending current and former customers information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter), to analyze Site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our sites content, layout, and services. These uses improve our Services and better tailor them to meet your needs.</li>
                                <li>To resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use and Conditions of Sale. At times, we may look across multiple members or users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to identify members using multiple Member Ids or aliases.</li>
                                <li>We use your personal, demographic and profile data to enhance your experience at our site and to enable us to present content we think you might be interested in, and for editorial or feedback purposes for our advertisers. </li>

                            <h4>Other Sites</h4>
