(As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Miracle Garcinia Cambogia., which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Miracle Garcinia Cambogia.</p>
<p><b>1.2 Third Party List Information.</b></p>
<p>Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller").

<p><b>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</b></p>
<p>Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").</p>
<p><b>(a) Cookies.</b></p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. 's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
<p><b>(b) Web Beacons.</b></p>
<p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an  programming function -- seehttp://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Miracle Garcinia Cambogia.'s database, visits the fishing website, Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site, and Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in fishing. Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Miracle Garcinia Cambogia. also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Miracle Garcinia Cambogia.'s database.</p>
<p><b>(c) New Technology.</b></p>
<p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Miracle Garcinia Cambogia.'s use of new and evolving technology.
