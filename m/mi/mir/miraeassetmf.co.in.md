Privacy Principles
For years, respecting and protecting individual client privacy has been vital to our business. By
sharing our Privacy Principles, we trust that our individual clients will better understand how we
keep client information private and secure while using it to provide services and products. Other
privacy principles or policies may apply to clients of certain Mirae Asset businesses in various
jurisdictions such as Asset Management clients all over the world. Similarly, Mirae Asset clients
who receive information from or transact business with Mirae Asset through the Internet are
covered by the terms and conditions and any privacy notices posted on the Web sites they visit.
We may disclose and transfer any information that is provided through this Web site to: any
company within the Mirae Asset group, its affiliates, agents or information providers; to any
other person or entity with a client’s consent; or if we have a right or duty to disclose or are
permitted or compelled to so disclose such information by law. We may also transmit, transfer or
process such information to, or through, any country in the world, as we deem necessary or
appropriate.
    We protect client information.
We take our responsibility to protect the privacy and confidentiality of any client information
very seriously. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with
applicable legal standards to store and secure client information from unauthorized access and
use, alteration and destruction. Our own policies and procedures have been developed to protect
the confidentiality of client information and to help achieve compliance with relevant rules and
regulations. We hold our employees accountable for complying with those policies, procedures,
rules and regulations.
    We endeavor to collect, use and maintain client information only for appropriate
    purposes.
We limit the collection, use and retention of client information to what we reasonably believe
will help us deliver superior service, to administer our business, manage our risks, market our
services and products, and to meet applicable laws and regulations.
    We share client information with affiliates and with others when we believe it will
    enhance the services and products we can provide to clients or for legal and routine
    business reasons.
    o We share client information among our affiliates and business units when we believe it will
       enhance the services we can provide to clients, but only in circumstances where such
       sharing conforms to law, any applicable confidentiality agreements, our policies and
       practices, or where a client has consented to such sharing.
    o We may disclose information we have about clients as permitted by law. For example, we
       may share information with regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials who have
       jurisdiction over us or if we are required to do so by applicable law and to provide
       information to protect against fraud. We may report cyber security incidents and also share
       cyber security incidents related information with the Indian Computer Emergency
       Response Team.
    o From time to time, we enter into agreements with other companies to provide services to
       us or make services and products available to clients. Under these agreements, the
       companies may receive information about clients, but they must safeguard this
       information and they may only use it for those purposes that we specify. In case of non-
       compliance with rules and regulations, user agreement and privacy policy for access or


       usage of Mirae Asset computer resource, the Mirae Asset has the right to immediately
       terminate the access or usage rights of the users to the computer resource and remove non-
       compliant information.
     We provide clients with relevant and appropriate choices regarding the sharing of
    information with our affiliates and others.
We will give clients choices regarding the sharing of information with affiliates and third parties
in accordance with applicable law and their agreements with us.
    Know Your Client (KYC) and prevention of Anti Money laundering laws.
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) and Rules to Prevention of Money
Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2005 (PMLA Rules) requires all financial institutions to obtain,
verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.
What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date
of birth (for individuals), PAN, bank account details and other information that will allow us to
identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents. Let us
help you understand what are KYC and IPV.

intermediaries. These changes would be applicable to new investors investing in mutual funds
w.e.f 1st January, 2012. However, existing KYC compliant investors of the Mutual Fund can

Online Security Tips
While Mirae Asset is committed to ensure the highest standard of security on our systems, you as
the end-user also play an important role to ensure that you are adequately protected when you
use the Internet. The following security best practices are recommended:
        Install anti-virus, anti-spyware and other internet security software on your PC. Use it
        regularly and keep it up-to-date.
        Take advantage of your PC’s security features. Make sure your browser uses the
        strongest encryption available and be aware of the encryption levels of the sites and
        applications you use.
        Regularly update your PC’s operating system and Web browser software with the
        vendor’s software patches and updates to protect your PC against known vulnerabilities.
        Do what you can to prevent unauthorized people from using your PC.
        Change your passwords often. Be sure to choose passwords that are hard for others to
        guess.
        If you notice suspicious activity in your accounts, report it immediately to the appropriate
        parties.
        Do not download or open any attachments sent to you by unsolicited email. Once opened,
        these programs may contain malicious programs that can compromise your PC’s security.
        Be on the alert for phishing scams. Access Web sites by typing the Web addresses
        directly into your Web browser or by using Web addresses you have bookmarked, instead
        of via embedded links in unsolicited emails.
If you feel you may have received a fraudulent email appearing to come from Mirae Asset,
please contact your account representative, financial advisor or client service team, or email to
our grievance officer Mr. Girish Dhanani at dhanani.girish@miraeasset.com or may reach us at
