Privacy Policy 

MITRE respects the privacy of its Web site users. This privacy policy explains the types of information collected from site visitors, and how MITRE uses that information. The use of the MITRE Web site constitutes acceptance of this policy.

Information Collected Automatically

When users visit the MITRE Web site, the Web site server logs basic information about each visit. We process this information monthly via an automated software tool to identify any site performance issues, popular sections and content, and other important site characteristics. This information does not identify you personally. This information is used only as a source of anonymous statistical information. 

The raw log data is retained for a minimum of 90 days.

Information Collected from E-mail and Web Forms

Users may contact MITRE by postal mail, telephone, or electronically, using information found on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/formrex.pl?config=wwwcontactus.txt) page. MITRE may share the information that you provide to us via e-mail within the corporation to respond to your queries, but we do not provide information to anyone outside of the corporation unless required by law to do so. We will never share your information with a third party for any commercial purpose.

Information Collected from Employment Applications

Users may apply for employment at MITRE from within the Employment section of our website, using the systems of one of our vendors. The information you supply is collected by our vendor and accessed by our vendor and MITRE during the application process.
