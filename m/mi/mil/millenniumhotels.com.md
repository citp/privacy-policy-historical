We may also ask for your room preferences and any other special requests or needs.
  * **Customer Service:** When you make a customer service request, we will ask for your name, mailing and/or email address, telephone number and any other information that will enable us to respond to your request or to resolve any problem at a Hotel.

  * Business partners, service providers and contractors in order to comply with any legal obligations (whether under a contract with them or you) and provide any products/services to you.

  * Any person, entity or organisation in order to comply with any legal obligation or regulatory requirement to enforce or apply our Terms of Website Use (<http://www.millenniumhotels.com/utilities/terms-conditions.html>), Guest Terms and Conditions (<http://www.millenniumhotels.com/utilities/guest-terms-and-conditions.html>) and any other agreement; or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of us, any Group member, our customers or others. 



### **Transfer and storage of your personal information**

Due to the global nature of our business, personal information we collect from you may be transferred, processed and stored overseas including (where applicable) outside the European Economic Area. Although the data protection laws of these other countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely, and in accordance with this Policy and any applicable laws.

By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storage and/or processing.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### **Third party websites**

Our Websites may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.  If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you provide any personal information using these websites.

### **Your rights**

We will take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of any personal information we hold about you. 

You can ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your information) if we intend to use, or disclose your information to any third party, for such purposes.

You may request access to, or the correction of, your personal information we hold, or to opt-out or change any specific marketing consents, by contacting us at dataprivacy@millenniumhotels.com. ** **

We note that additional privacy policies may also apply in certain circumstances, e.g. where you have agreed to our Guests Terms and Conditions, the MCLC Terms and Conditions, or where you have entered into another contract with us or any other Group member. Any additional consents you provide through other channels (e.g. guest registration cards at a Hotel) will apply.

To enable us to process your requests promptly, please provide full details of the particular information you seek and documentary evidence of your identity. Any access request may be subject to a fee to meet our reasonable costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

We only retain your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances to enable us to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Policy, subject to applicable law.
