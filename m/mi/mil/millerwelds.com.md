---|---  
  
We actively collect personal information from our Website visitors when they provide it to us directly in responding to specific questions or requests on the Website _(e.g._ , personal information provided through our Website submission form or careers page). Miller uses this information for the purposes of pursuing its ordinary course of business as described in more detail below. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us through our Website submission form, your personal information will be used to track and respond to your inquiry and provide you with the information and support requested. Similarly, if you provide your resume to Miller for purposes of obtaining employment, the resume will be used for activities related to your potential employment. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information on the Website.

From time to time, we may also use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies (such as changes to this Privacy Statement when required under applicable law). Because this information is important to your interaction with Miller, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.

To the extent non-personal information ( _e.g._ , log data, location data, or cookie data) is combined with personal information, we treat such combined information as personal information for purposes of this Privacy Statement. We use this combined information for the purposes described in the Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information section below, our [Cookie Notice](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy), and as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement.

**Compatibility**

In general, and as required under applicable law, we will use the personal information we collect from you only for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect your personal information. However, we may also use your personal information for other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes we have disclosed to you (such as archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes) if and where this is permitted by applicable data protection laws. In any event, we take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and, where necessary, kept up-to-date.

**Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information _(European Visitors Only)_**

If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, the legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Statement will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, the applicable legal basis for our processing of your personal information normally includes one of the following:

  * **Based on your consent**.In some cases, at the point at which you provide personal information, we may ask you for your consent to collect and process such information. If you choose to provide us with your consent, you may later withdraw your consent (or _opt-out_ ) by contacting us using the contact details provided under the How You Can Contact Miller section below. Please note that if you withdraw your consent it will not affect any processing of your personal information that has already occurred. Where we process your personal information based on consent, we will provide more detailed information to you at the time when we obtain your consent.
  * **Performance of a contract**.In specific circumstances, we may need to process your personal information to fulfill our obligations under a contract to which you are subject. Where we are processing your personal information to fulfill our obligations under a contract to which you are a party, you may not be able to object to such processing, or if you do choose to opt-out or object to such processing, it may impact our ability to perform a contractual obligation that you are owed.
  * **Compliance with applicable laws**.In specific circumstances, we may need to process your personal information to comply with an applicable law. Where we process your personal information to meet our legal obligations, you will likely not be permitted to object to such processing, but you will usually have the right to access or review the relevant personal information unless it would impede our legal obligations.
  * **Miller's legitimate interests**. We may process your personal information based on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party) to the extent such interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In such cases, you have the right to object to the relevant processing of your personal information by contacting us as described under the How You Can Contact Miller section below.



If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make such legitimate interests clear to you at the relevant time.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the How You Can Contact Miller section below.

**Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information**

  * **Location data**.Depending on your computer or device permissions, we may collect information about your device's approximate ( _e.g._ , country or zip code) or precise location (" **location data** "). Various technologies may be used to collect this location information, such as IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may provide information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers. _We will only collect your computer's or device's precise location with your consent_.


  * **Cookie data**.Our Website uses cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies (referred to as " **cookies and similar technologies** ") to collect and store certain non-personal information (such as log data and location data) when you visit or interact with our Website to help us secure our Website, as well as the information processed through our Website; monitor and enhance the performance of our Website; better understand Website visitor behavior; and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and Website features (information contained in or generated by the use of cookies and similar technologies is referred to in this Privacy Statement as " **cookie data** ").

In addition, when we aggregate or anonymize information (including personal information), such aggregated or anonymized data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Statement and may be used and shared by us for any legitimate business purpose.
