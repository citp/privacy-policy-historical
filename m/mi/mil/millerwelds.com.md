**1\. Information Miller Electric Collects From You**

**Active Information Collection** Like many other web sites, we actively collect information from our visitors both by asking specific questions on the Web Site and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via online forms and e-mail. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable and/or "personal information" under Canadian law. Such personally identifiable or personal information includes information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your name, business name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc. However, under Canadian law, "personal information" does not include your business address or other information used to contact you at your place of work. Contact information may be used to send information about our company to our customers and to learn about customer satisfaction with our services. We run contests on the Web Site in which we ask visitors for contact information. The contact information may be used to contact the visitor when necessary. Any credit card information you provide for the purchase of goods is handled in a secure manner and is used only for your intended purchase.

**Passive Information Collection** As you navigate through a web site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection. Like most web site operators, we track IP addresses during your visit and use session, persistent, and flash cookies and may use any other successor tracker technology. We use cookies to help identify you when you visit the Web Site and to keep track of your shopping list. You should be aware that we might use these cookies for other purposes now and in the future. Our system also automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on the Web Site and collects operational information about the technology you use, such as your browser, type of computer, operating systems, and Internet service providers.

We passively collect information to generate statistics and measure Web Site activity in order to understand what areas of the Web Site are most popular, which areas may require improvement and what technologies our visitors are using. This information helps us to update and improve the Web Site and enhance the usefulness of customer visits. We also use this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security breaches and to provide you with a safe online environment.

  **2\. How Miller Electric Uses Your Information**

Miller Electric uses your personal information to enhance the operation of the Web Site, allow you to use all of its features, and provide you with the services that you request. Miller Electric may contact you about new features or products in which it believes you may be interested.

Miller Electric may share your personal information with reputable vendors or affiliates that assist us in processing information, providing products or services that our customers order, or conducting market and segmentation research. These vendors are restricted from using the information for any other purpose. Miller Electric does not rent, sell, or otherwise share your information with third parties for purposes unrelated to the Web Site.

Miller Electric may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, online traffic patterns and related information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will not identify any individual or include any personally identifying information.

Miller Electric also will disclose any information that it is required to disclose by law or by an appropriate government authority. In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, or reorganization of Miller Electric or in connection with a transfer of the assets related to the Web Site, we may transfer all of the information we maintain on you to the applicable successor(s), but such transfer will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  **3\. Choices You Have About How Miller Electric Uses Your Information**

We strive to provide you with as many choices and as much control as possible regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

You may opt out of having your e-mail address used for promotional purposes by Miller Electric. This opt out does not apply to information provided to Miller Electric as a result of a product purchase, warranty registration, product service experience or other transactions. If you no longer wish to receive information or promotional materials from us by e-mail you may opt out of receiving these communications by using one of the following methods:

  **4\. How Miller Electric Protects Your Information**

We work hard to protect your personal information. The Web Site has both technical and procedural security measures in place to protect information under our control against the loss, misuse and alteration, including but not limited to SSL encryption for data transfer, firewalls, restricted access to data, employee training, and other methods. When you place orders, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server encrypts all sensitive information you input before it is transmitted to us. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed access.

The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Never share your password with anyone else and notify us promptly if you believe your password security has been breached.

When personally identifiable information is no longer required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, it will be destroyed, erased or made anonymous, provided there are no legal requirements for its continued retention. Our systematic practices for information and records retention and destruction apply to personally identifiable information.

The Web Site contains links to other web sites operated by third parties that may be of interest to you.
