3rd Party Advertisements - Google Adsense  
 Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and sometimes whether you have the Flash player installed or not.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

In the case of Google Adsense ads, this ad server uses the DoubleClick DART cookie. As per the Google website, it is explained as such:

• Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this website (www.MilitaryFactory.com).  
• Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.  
• Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.

3rd Party Advertisements - TribalFusion, BurstMedia  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Affiliate Partner - Quinstreet  
We are partnered with Quinstreet to deliver education-based results through their proprietary search engine. These ads appear across our site as interactive forms with user-initiated drop-down selected options or clearly marked banner advertising. Use of these forms is entirely at your discretion, though particularly useful to those seeking more information from institutions about programs currently offered or military benefits to enrollees. MilitaryFactory.com does NOT record any of the information you deliberately send to these schools requesting additional information.
