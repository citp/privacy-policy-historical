# MilitaryFactory.com Privacy Policy

UPDATED: 12/3/2009

Your privacy is important to us!

Stat Tracking

MilitaryFactory.com does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to our website. We have no interest in you as a person, only as an anonymous entity with observable behavioral patterns. As such we do collect standard traffic and user habit information that most every other website you visit collects. This information is used to gain a better understanding of user behavior and traffic patterns to which we can use to provide a better user experience on our website in the future. The statistical tracking allows up to see what technologies our users are viewing the site with and allows us to make changes to our site to accommodate this technology.

For your information, the following is the only information we collect during a typical visit to our website:

  


  * Browser Type and Resolution
  * Operating System
  * IP Address
  * Entry Page, Pages Visited in Order of Visit and Exit Page
  * Inbound Links from whence you came to our website (if coming from another website's link)



So rest assured that no personal information of yours is being collected, tracked and reviewed. We collect information that is completely anonymous and is information that is tracked by most any other website you visit on any given day. 

So, in short, we don't care if you're Jim-Bob from Po-Dunk, USA - but we do care about why anonymous user "34.546.77.45" came to our site for only 5 seconds before deciding to leave. So we'd research what page(s) that anonymous user visited, how he/she came to our site and why that user might have left so quickly, addressing the issue by perhaps providing more relevant content to our website pages for any future visits to our site by that visitor. 

For a real-time example of what is tracked and what isn't, you can always visit our publicly-displayed traffic stats information [here](http://extremetracking.com/open;unique?login=m1l1fact).
