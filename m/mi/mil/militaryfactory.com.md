# Military Factory Privacy Policy

## Because your privacy is important to us.

UPDATED: 12/17/2013

Your privacy is important to us!

Stat Tracking  
For your information, the following is the only information we collect during a typical visit to our website:

  
• Browser Type and Resolution  
• Operating System  
• IP Address  
• Entry Page, Pages Visited in Order of Visit and Exit Page  
• Inbound Links from whence you came to our website (if coming from another website's link) 

You can rest assured that no personal information of yours is being collected, tracked or reviewed. As most sites do, we collect information that is completely anonymous. So, in short, we don't care if you're Jim-Bob from Po-Dunk, USA - but we do care about why anonymous user "34.546.77.45" came to our site for only 5 seconds before deciding to leave. So we would research what page(s) that anonymous user visited, how he/she came to our site and why that user might have left so quickly, addressing the issue by perhaps providing more relevant content for any future visits to our site by that visitor or others like him/her.

For a real-time example of what is tracked and what isn't, you can always visit our publicly-displayed traffic stats information [here](http://extremetracking.com/open;unique?login=m1l1fact).

3rd Party Advertisements - Google Adsense  
 Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and sometimes whether you have the Flash player installed or not.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

In the case of Google Adsense ads, this ad server uses the DoubleClick DART cookie. As per the Google website, it is explained as such:

• Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this website (www.MilitaryFactory.com).  
• Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.  
• Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.

3rd Party Advertisements - TribalFusion, BurstMedia  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Affiliate Partner - Quinstreet  
We are partnered with Quinstreet to deliver education-based results through their proprietary search engine. These ads appear across our site as interactive forms with user-initiated drop-down selected options or clearly marked banner advertising. Use of these forms is entirely at your discretion, though particularly useful to those seeking more information from institutions about programs currently offered or military benefits to enrollees. MilitaryFactory.com does NOT record any of the information you deliberately send to these schools requesting additional information.
