## Automatic Information Collection And Tracking 

As you navigate through and interact with our Website, or when you download, access and use the App, we may use automatic data collection technologies. These technologies do not identify you as an individual, but do collect information regarding your internet service provider, computer, mobile device and connected tools. An example of such technology would be the use of browser cookies. 

The type of such automatically collected information includes: 

  * Usage Details. When you access and use the App, Website, or ONE-KEY™ Tools we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the Website, ONE-KEY™ Tools or App, including traffic data, location data, tool connection and performance data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on or through the App or Website.

If you do not want us to collect this information do not use the Website and do not download the App or delete it from your device. 

With respect to use of ONE-KEY™ Tools, the ONE-KEY™ Tools contain technology that identify the serial number and type of the tool (saw, drill, etc.) and broadcasts this information as a “Advertisement” that can be read by phones utilizing the App in the surrounding area. All Apps monitor for such Advertisements, even if the App is being used by another on another's device. The App will from time to time transmit the GPS location from the phone and Advertisement information received from the One Key Tool's whose Advertisements were detected by the App on the phone. While the GPS function of the phone will be used to identify the location of any ONE-KEY™ Tool (yours or others) whose Advertisements are detected by the App, no information identifying the owner of the ONE-KEY™ Tool whose Advertisement was detected by the App will be accessible or provided to the owner of the ONE-KEY™ App. Furthermore, no information regarding the App is provided to the ONE-KEY™ Tool. The owner of the ONE-KEY™ Tool can access the most recent location information Advertisement regarding their own ONE-KEY™ Tool by accessing their own App account to assist them in finding a lost tool. 

The detection and transmission of Advertisement data by the App may be disabled at any time by a feature on the App. When disabled, the App will not transmit the location of your phone. 

Additionally, a user of the ONE-KEY™ App or ONE-KEY™y program on the Website can manually identify that a ONE-KEY™ Tool is theirs and place that tool in the users “inventory” on the users ONE-KEY™ account (“User Inventoried ONE-KEY™ Tool”). Information concerning this User Inventoried ONE-KEY™ Tool (tool settings, tool location, serial number and other information) will be collected and stored by the ONE-KEY™ App and uploaded to the users account on the Website where it will be accessible to the user. The ONE-KEY™ App or ONE-KEY™ program on the Website can control the settings of the User Inventoried ONE-KEY™ Tool. Furthermore, a user can create a guest account (“Guest Account”) on the App or the Website. A user can allow or disallow a Guest account User using the ONE-KEY™ App or ONE-KEY™ program on the Website to: connect to a User Inventoried ONE-KEY™ Tool and change the tools settings; connect to a User Inventoried ONE-KEY™ Tool and lock or unlock the User Inventoried ONE-KEY™ Tool; access a listing of all the One Key Tools in a users inventory; add or edit ONE-KEY™ Tools to a user's inventory.
