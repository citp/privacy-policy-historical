  * **Routine Use(s)** : In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records may be disclosed outside the DoD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows: To authorized DoD military occupational specialty contractors for the purpose of responding to service member or family member need. To contractors and grantees for the purpose of supporting research studies concerned with the effectiveness of non-medical counseling interventions.

Any release of information contained in this system of records outside the DoD under a routine use will be compatible with the purpose(s) for which the information is collected and maintained. The DoD Blanket Routine Uses set forth at the beginning of the Office of the Secretary of Defense compilation of systems or records notices may apply to this system.
