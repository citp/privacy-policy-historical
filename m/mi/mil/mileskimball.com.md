We do not offer that kind of payment option. However, you may download a [printable order form](https://mk.ssb-media.com/images/docs/mk_orderform.pdf) from the website and mail it in with a check.

Sales and use taxes are imposed by state and local jurisdictions on goods purchased at retail by consumers.  Retailers subject to state law are required to collect the state’s sales and use taxes from their customers.  Miles Kimball collects the applicable sales tax on all orders shipped to Wisconsin.  As a result of a recent US Supreme Court decision, we are now required to collect sales and use taxes in many other states.  Each state and local jurisdiction has its own rules for what are “taxable goods” and what are exempt goods.  For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. **_Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet, by catalog or by other remote means._** Many states require purchasers to file a use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed by a retailer, and to pay tax on those purchases.

Effective January 1, 2019, we will collect for AL, CO, CT, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KY, LA, MD, ME, MA, MI, MN, MS, NE, NV, NJ, NC, ND, OK, PA, RI, SD, UT, VT, WA, WV, WI and DC.  We will start collecting sales tax effective February 1, 2019 for SC and WY and effective April 1, 2019 for CA.  We will update this disclosure as new states enact sales and use tax collection laws. 

**_For mail orders:_**   To ensure that your order is processed, you must add sales tax for the address to which the order will be shipped. Please see <https://www.vertexinc.com/resources/tax-rate-calculator> to look-up the correct rate.

**_If you live in Puerto Rico_** , please read this information about sales and use tax.  The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico requires Puerto Rico purchasers to report all purchases that were not taxed and pay tax on those purchases.  Sales and use taxes may be reported and paid by filing Form SC 2970A, Declaration of Use of Imported Goods and Services, and pay the corresponding tax.  Individuals must file the declaration with the payment through the electronic system known as Unified Internal Revenue System (SURI).  Circular Letter 17-08 issued by the Puerto Rico Treasury Department provides further information and instructions. 

Due to our already low prices, Clearance products are not eligible for additional discounts at the order level. A Clearance item can be recognized by its sale price, which will always end in a “2”.

a. Applicability. Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of these Terms (together, “Disputes”), will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis as described in these Terms (this “Arbitration Agreement”). But, in the event of any actual, alleged, or threatened violation of confidentiality or violation of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights, we may immediately resort to court proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in order to seek immediate injunctive relief without posting bond, proving damages, or meeting any similar requirement. Any institution of any action for injunctive relief will not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of either party to submit any claim seeking relief other than injunctive relief to arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you; us; our affiliates; Company’s and its affiliates’ respective directors, officers, owners, employees, contractors, consultants, agents, representatives, predecessors in interest, successors in interest, and assigns; authorized and unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Site; and any third-party beneficiaries.

_b. Arbitrator._  Arbitration proceedings will be administered by JAMS/Endispute (“ **JAMS** ”) before an arbitrator selected pursuant to the JAMS rules. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding. Any final award or judgment may be filed and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties will share equally in the costs assessed for the arbitration and each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. Any arbitration proceeding may not be consolidated or joined with any other proceeding and will not proceed as a class action.  **The parties understand that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate Disputes through a court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, and to participate in a class action or other proceeding involving multiple claimants, but they have instead chosen to have all Disputes decided through individual arbitration.**

_c. Place; Federal Arbitration Act._  The place of arbitration will be Winnebago County, Wisconsin, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties to the arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16, will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement.

_d. Confidentiality._  Any and all actions taken under this Arbitration Agreement, including all filings, orders, judgments, and awards made in any arbitration proceeding, are confidential and may not be disclosed to any third party.

_e. Time Limitation on Claims._  Arbitration proceedings must be initiated within one year after any Dispute arises; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred.

  * _Performance related._  These cookies assess the performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how visitors use and interact with the Site, for example, which pages on our websites users visit most often. These cookies also enable us to personalize content and remember your preferences (e.g., your choice of language, country, or region). These cookies help us improve the way our websites work and provide a better, personalized user experience. Some of our performance-related cookies are managed for us by third parties.

These services collect information about your visits to and interactions with the Site and other websites and will use that information to target advertisements for goods and services. The information collected may be associated with your personal information. These targeted advertisements may appear on the Site or on other websites. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of the Site and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider, the date and time of a visit to a website, and other interactions between you and a website. 

We use Google AdWords, an online advertising service provided by Google, to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on the Site. Google uses your Internet searches, cookies, and similar identifiers (e.g., pixel tags) to collect information about your visits to the Site and your interaction with our products and services to generate targeted advertisements to you on other websites that you visit across the Internet. To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google, to customize your ad preferences, or to limit Google’s collection or use this information, visit [Google’s Safety Center](https://www.google.com/safetycenter/tools) and [Google’s Ad Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) and follow [Google’s personalized ad opt-out instructions](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en&ref_topic=7048998). Opting out will not affect your use of the Site. 

**To change your preferences with respect to certain online ads and to obtain more information about third-party ad networks and online behavioral advertising, please visit the  **[ **National Advertising Initiative Consumer opt-out page**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) **  or the **[ **Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program**](http://www.aboutads.info/) **.**  Please remember that changing your settings with individual browsers or ad networks will not necessarily carry over to other browsers or ad networks. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads from time to time. 

**Single Sign-On.**  You may sign up for and log into your account using your Amazon.com account by providing your Amazon log-in information on the Site when prompted. If you choose to use this feature, Company may access, handle, and store information that you have provided through Amazon and make that information available on the Site. This feature may require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, and application protocol interfaces (APIs) provided by Amazon to facilitate those communications and features. We do not and cannot control any policies or terms of any third-party service, including those of Amazon. All information you have provided to Amazon is subject to the [Amazon Privacy Notice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010). ** **

**Social Media.**  The Site may allow you to connect to and share information with various social media platforms, for example, Facebook. These features may require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, and application protocol interfaces (APIs) provided by those social media platforms to facilitate those communications and features. We may share information that you provide us or that we may collect about your use of the Site with those platforms and that information will be subject to their privacy policies. We encourage you to review those platforms’ privacy policies: see [Facebook’s Data Policy](https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy). In addition, by choosing to use any third-party social media platform or choosing to share content or communications with any social media platform, you allow us to share information with the designated social media platform. We cannot control any policies or terms of such third party platform. As a result, we cannot be responsible for any use of your information or content by a third party platform, which you use at your own risk. 

The Site may also use the advertising services and networks offered by those social media platforms to deliver advertising content. Use of these services requires social media platforms to implement cookies or pixel tags to deliver ads to you while you are logged into the platform. 

If you do not wish a social media platform to collect information relating to you via the Site, we suggest that you: (a) hide social media platform plug-ins using an ad blocker; (b) always log off completely from the social media platform before visiting other websites and delete all related cookies; and, (c) where the option made available by the social media platform, disable the advertising services and networks operated by that platform. 

The Company is active on social media, including Facebook. You have the opportunity to comment on those social media platforms regarding Company and the products and services we offer. We reserve the right to post on our websites and social media pages any comments or content that you post on our social media pages. ** **

We may use aggregate data to understand Site users’ needs, to determine Site user demographics and usage patterns, to determine what kinds of products and services we can provide, and to improve and enrich our products, our services, and the Site. 

**Evaluation and Improvement of the Site.**  We may use Collected Information: to analyze, develop, and improve the content, materials, products, and services that we make available through the Site and the Site’s functionality; to inform marketing and communication plans and strategies; to evaluate user needs and customize Site content, promotional emails, and your browsing experience; and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes. 

**To Protect Company and Others.**  We may share your personal information with law enforcement, regulatory authorities, courts with competent jurisdictions, emergency services, and other necessary third parties for legal, protection, security, and safety purposes, including: (a) to comply with laws or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests and legal process; (b) to perform credit checks, report or collect debts owed; (c) to protect our rights and property, our agents and customers, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms and to protect our network and physical assets; and (d) to protect the safety of our employees, agents, and customers, and any other person. ** **

**With Your Consent.**  With your consent, we may share your personal information in ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy. 

**Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Information (EEA Only)** ** **

If you are an individual from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so; (b) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g., to deliver services you have requested); or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. 

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and will advise you whether or not the provision of your personal information is mandatory, as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information. Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our or a third party’s legitimate interests that are not already described in this Privacy Policy, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are. 

If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided further below provided below under “Contact Us.” 

**International Transfers of Your Personal Information**  

In operating the Site, your personal information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in countries other than the country in which you are resident. Those countries may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. Specifically, our Site servers and some of our service providers are located in the United States and our affiliated companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in other countries. We have, however, taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**Information Security  **

Company does not guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of Collected Information will not occur, but we take appropriate technical and organizational security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of Collected Information under our control. Specifically, on our shopping cart and payment pages, Secure Socket Layers technology is used to encrypt information passed between your browser and our systems. While we are focused on the security of your personal information and follow strict standards, processes and procedures that designed to protect your personal information, you must remember that the Internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses and intrusions from others and so we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that we will be able to protect your personal information at all times and in all circumstances. 

If you become aware of any breach of Site security or this Privacy Policy, please notify us at [privacy@mileskimball.com](mailto:privacy@mileskimball.com) immediately. If our security system is breached, we will notify you of the breach only if and to the extent required under applicable law. 

**How Long We Retain Your Personal Information**  

We will retain your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (e.g., tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if that is not possible (e.g., because your personal information has been stored in back-up archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 

For personal information that we process on behalf of our customers, we will retain that personal information in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them, subject to applicable law.

### About Us

Click on the question below to expand the answer

The Miles Kimball Company is a leader in the catalog business — offering cards, gifts, helpful household items, and unique food products. Operating from the shores of the Fox River in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the business consists of several distinct catalogs: Miles Kimball, Christmas Cards by Miles Kimball, and Mrs. Kimball’s Candy Shoppe. It started almost 80 years ago, when an ambitious young man named Miles went into business with a simple idea: to market a Christmas card in which the design spelled out the name of the sender. With a Minneapolis phone book and some borrowed cash, Miles printed and mailed a card personalized “Johnson” to every household with that name in the Twin Cities. The response was fantastic, and provided Miles Kimball with enough seed money to produce his first catalog. Decades later, Christmas cards — the idea that started it all — are still produced and personalized in Oshkosh. Specializing in exclusively designed ornaments, labels, children’s accessories, outdoor decor and gifts, the personal touch continues to be the Miles Kimball hallmark. As we continue to grow, we remain true to our founder’s vision: to provide you with the unique, the unusual and the unexpected. We hope you return to our site often to discover what we have in store.

### Transparency in Supply Chain

Click on the question below to expand the answer

Silver Star Brands strongly opposes slavery and human trafficking, and would never knowingly conduct business with suppliers of retail products who engage in such practices. With each wholesale order, our business partners are required to certify that all applicable laws are followed in regards to slavery and human trafficking. Our supply chain staff ensure the enforcement of this policy with purchase agreements that prominently state this requirement to our vendors.

Our purchase orders include a provision that requires our vendors to agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Silver Star Brands requires that no goods be manufactured in whole or in part with prison labor, forced labor, indentured labor or child labor.
