Who are we?

The Miles Kimball Company is a leader in the catalog business — offering cards, gifts, helpful household items, and unique food products. Operating from the shores of the Fox River in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the business consists of several distinct catalogs: Miles Kimball, Christmas Cards by Miles Kimball, and Mrs. Kimball’s Candy Shoppe.

It started almost 80 years ago, when an ambitious young man named Miles went into business with a simple idea: to market a Christmas card in which the design spelled out the name of the sender. With a Minneapolis phone book and some borrowed cash, Miles printed and mailed a card personalized “Johnson” to every household with that name in the Twin Cities. The response was fantastic, and provided Miles Kimball with enough seed money to produce his first catalog.

Decades later, Christmas cards — the idea that started it all — are still produced and personalized in Oshkosh. Specializing in exclusively designed ornaments, labels, children’s accessories, outdoor decor and gifts, the personal touch continues to be the Miles Kimball hallmark. As we continue to grow, we remain true to our founder’s vision: to provide you with the unique, the unusual and the unexpected. We hope you return to our site often to discover what we have in store.

What is the Miles Kimball Environmental Policy?

Did you know?

* Miles Kimball Company has invested $150,000 in lighting upgrades at the distribution center that has resulted in the annual electricity savings of 1,100,000 kilowatt hours. This is the equivalent of providing electricity to 100 homes or the energy of 1990 barrels of oil. The impact of this project is reducing our carbon footprint by 2,522,920lbs of CO2 annually. [Click here for more detail](https://web.archive.org/web/20140415094537id_/http%3A//www.mileskimball.com/mileskimball/images/docs/Copy%20of%20Environmental%20Emissions%20Equivalents.xls).  
* Miles Kimball Company uses corrugate shipping containers made from over 60% post consumer content.  
* Miles Kimball Company is committed to recycling. Annually, our distribution center recycles 600 tons of cardboard and 60 tons of office paper.  
* From 2005 to 2007 our use of lighter weight paper has reduced our total wood use by 1,472 tons, or 10,191 trees. The energy saved was 21,806 million BTU’s, enough to power 240 homes each year. Greenhouse gases were reduced the equivalent of 4,364,582 lbs CO2, or the emissions from 396 cars per year. Wastewater was reduced 10,219,474 gallons.

Do I have to pay sales tax?

Miles Kimball collects the applicable sales tax on all orders shipped to Wisconsin.

 **Colorado, Oklahoma and Kentucky Sales Tax**

We do not collect sales or use taxes in all states. For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. Details of how to file these returns may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities.

For Oklahoma purchasers, the tax may be reported and paid on the Oklahoma individual income tax return [Form 511] or by filing a consumer use tax return [Form 21-1]. The referenced forms and corresponding instructions are available on the Oklahoma Tax Commission website, www.tax.ok.gov.

We may be required by Colorado law to provide purchasers an end-of-year summary of Colorado purchases in order to assist purchasers in filing their tax returns. We also may be required by law to provide the Colorado Department of Revenue with a report of the total amount of all your purchases at the end of the year. We will not provide any transactional details to the Department other than the total amount of your purchases.

For Kentucky purchasers, we are not required to and do not collect Kentucky sales or use tax, the purchase may be subject to Kentucky use tax unless the purchase is exempt from taxation in Kentucky, the purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the internet, by catalog or by any other remote means. The Commonwealth of Kentucky requires Kentucky purchasers to report all purchases of tangible personal property or digital property that are not taxed by the retailer and pay use tax on those purchases unless exempt under Kentucky law. The tax may be reported and paid on the Kentucky individual income tax return or by filing a consumer use tax return with the Kentucky department of Revenue. These forms and corresponding instructions may be found on the Kentucky Department of Revenue’s internet web site.

Some customers have asked why these new requirements exist. We are required to provide the notice and the reports described above for Colorado purchases based on a Colorado law (HB 1193) enacted in February 2010. We are required to provide the notice (but not the reports) above for Oklahoma purchases based on an Oklahoma law (HB 2359) enacted in June 2010. We are required to provide the notice and the reports described above for Kentucky purchases based on a Kentucky law (HB 440) enacted in October 2013.

How does Installment Billing work?

Installment billing is available for credit card orders only and is subject to approval. (Debit cards may be used however charges will be preauthorized and funds will be reserved in your account prior to billing.) Merchandise total must exceed $75 after discounts, promotions, and gift certificates have been applied to your order. Your merchandise total will be divided into equal payments. The first payment will also include shipping & handling fees and sales tax and will be charged to your credit card on the date we ship your order. The balance due will be divided into equal monthly payments each commencing 30 days from the date of your previous payment. We will automatically charge your credit card until full payment is received. In the case of split shipments, drop shipments, or backorders your payments may be split based on when your items ship. There is no interest charged by The Miles Kimball Company for installment billing. Normal interest charges may be applied by your credit card company per your individual card agreement. If unable to obtain credit card authorization at the time of billing, you authorize The Miles Kimball Company to charge up to the full unpaid balance to another credit card we have on file. Installment Billing only available on select offers.

What is Auto Refill?

The Auto Refill program is an automatic delivery service which allows you to receive select products you use on a regular basis every 30, 60, 90 or 120 days depending on the item. No need to worry about reordering. Your shipping is FREE on subsequent orders so you save both time and money when you sign up. 

How do I lock in my initial order price using Auto Refill?

When you use Auto Refill, the price never goes up. By avoiding price increases online or in the catalog, you save money by getting the same price you paid in your initial order. Even when you receive a special promotion or sale price, the price stays the same on all your future Auto Refill orders. 

How much is shipping?

On your initial order you will pay the regular shipping and handling price as noted in our shipping and handling chart. On all subsequent refill orders your shipment is FREE.
