Installment Billing Details:  
Installment billing is available for credit card orders only and is subject to approval. (Debit cards may be used however charges will be preauthorized and funds will be reserved in your account prior to billing.) Merchandise total must exceed $60 after discounts, promotions, and gift certificates have been applied to your order.   
Your merchandise total will be divided into equal payments. The first payment will also include shipping & handling fees and sales tax and will be charged to your credit card on the date we ship your order. The balance due will be divided into equal monthly payments each commencing 30 days from the date of your previous payment. We will automatically charge your credit card until full payment is received. In the case of split shipments, drop shipments, or backorders your payments may be split based on when your items ship. There is no interest charged by The Miles Kimball Company for installment billing. Normal interest charges may be applied by your credit card company per your individual card agreement.   
If unable to obtain credit card authorization at the time of billing, you authorize The Miles Kimball Company to charge up to the full unpaid balance to another credit card we have on file.   
Installment Billing only available on select offers.
