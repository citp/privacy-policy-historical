	<h1><a href="/help">Help</a>: Privacy Policy</h1>
	

	
<p>
Updated: October 18, 2007
</p><p>
MileSplit, Inc. will always look after the best interests and the privacy of our visitors first.  
This Site is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the 
United States of America, its territories and possessions ("U.S."). If you are not yet 13 years old, 
or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if, for any reason, 
you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the features, activities and 
services that require you to provide your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy is legally binding 
on all users.
</p><p>
<b>What information do you collect about me? </b><br>
MileSplit collects personal identifying information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information 
to us on website and through email. When visiting our online sites, we collect volunteered information such as 
survey information and/or site registration. 
</p><p>
<b>What's in it for me? </b><br>
Plenty! The information we collect allows us to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each 
visitor. Plus, it enables us to notify you about updates to our Web site...contact you with special offers of 
interest...and customize your Web site experience. In addition, information is shared with reputable organizations 
who may contact you with special offers of possible interest. 
</p><p>
<b>What are "cookies" and what do they do for me? </b><br>
Cookies are a small file that your web browser stores in order for a web site to store a bit of information 
that it can retrieve later. A web site can only read cookie data that it wrote and not cookies that other 
web sites set. We use cookies to allow you to login, remember your preferences, and other such things. 
</p><p>
<b>With whom do you share information about me? </b><br>
We will not share your information with third parties unless you authorize it.  For example, you may choose 
to allow us to share your information with Rodale Inc., the publisher of Runner's World and Running Times 
Magazines.  The only other exception would be where we are legally required to do so or in order to protect 
public safety. We will never sell or otherwise provide your information to a third party without your permission. 
</p><p>
<b>Links </b><br>
Our site may, on occasion, contain links to other sites with information gathering practices different from 
our own. Visitors should consult privacy policies for all other sites as we have no control over information 
submitted to or collected by such third parties. 
</p><p>
Our site sometimes offers promotions sponsored or co-sponsored by third parties. These third parties may obtain 
personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes 
or promotion. We have no control over the third party sponsor's use of this information.  This site will notify 
you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third party sponsors will be provided access 
to such information. 
</p><p>
<b>What if I don't want e-mail from MileSplit? </b><br>
We do not send out an regular emails or bulk mails.  But if you want to be excluded from any communication
with us, please let us know by emailing admin@milesplit.com. 
</p><p>
<b>May I see the information you collect about me? </b><br>
Yes! Upon request, we provide our customers with access to personal account information and contact information. 
You may access the information by logging in to your account (if you created one) and change your information or 
settings at any time. Just login and then click on the "Profile" link at the top right of any page. From your 
profile there will be edit buttons that allow you to make changes to different areas. You will not be able to 
change your login name or email address. This is because both of these must be unique in our system and also 
because we require valid email addresses. 
</p><p>
<b>Changes... </b><br>
We may need to change this privacy policy from time to time in order to address new issues, evolving technologies, 
changes on our sites or business practices. We may change this policy without notice to you but we will post those 
changes so you will always know what information we gather and how we might use that information. Please refer back 
to this policy regularly. 
</p><p>
<b>Rules for Submissions and Messages </b><br>
Responsibility for what is posted in the discussion forums lies with each user--you alone are responsible for the 
content of your messages, and the consequences of any such messages. We cannot and do not review every submission 
a user may make. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy or propriety of any submission. We do, however, 
reserve the right but do not assume the obligation to restrict or prohibit your use of our sites if we believe
