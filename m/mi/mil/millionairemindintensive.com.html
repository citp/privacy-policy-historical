    	<p class="bcontent">We may disclose Participant and Visitor information to the following third parties, under the following circumstances:<br><br>


        <strong>Companies who work on our behalf</strong><br>
We may contract with other companies to perform business support functions on our behalf, which may involve limited access to your personal information. We require these companies to use the information only to provide the contracted services; they are prohibited from transferring the information to another party except as needed to provide those services. Some examples of these business support functions include order fulfillment, survey execution and information systems management. We also may make aggregate non-personal information available to select service providers.<br><br>
<strong>Subsidiaries and joint ventures</strong><br>
A subsidiary or a joint venture is an organization in which we own at least a 50% interest. If we share your information with a subsidiary or joint venture partner, we will require that they not transfer your information to another party for marketing purposes or use your information contrary to your expressed choices. If you have indicated that you do not want to receive any marketing information from us, we will not share your information with our subsidiary or joint venture partner for their marketing purposes.<br><br>
<strong>Referring Ambassadors</strong><br>
If you have been referred to us by an Ambassador, under the terms of our Ambassador Program, we may share information concerning your registration with your referring Ambassador.<br><br>
<strong>Business Transfers</strong><br>
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. If the business is sold or transferred, we will give you an opportunity to tell us not to transfer your personal information. In some cases, this may mean that the new organization will not be able to continue providing to you the services or products that we provided.<br><br>
<strong>Law Enforcement</strong><br>
We may disclose personal information to third parties without your consent for any of the following reasons: to comply with any law, regulation or court order, to cooperate with Government investigations, to help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights of our Company or its subsidiaries.<br><br>
<strong>With Your Consent</strong><br>
In all other cases, we will obtain your express consent before sharing your information with third parties. For example, we may conduct a joint offer or contest with a third party and you will be asked whether your personal information should be shared with that third party.

<p class="bcontent">
We may periodically conduct both business and individual surveys. We encourage participation in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of programs and services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our surveys is voluntary. Information about how to opt-out of surveys will be contained in survey communications.<br><br>

We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other Participants we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and programs. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.<br><br>
