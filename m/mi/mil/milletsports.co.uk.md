# Privacy and Security – Millet Sports

We take the safety and security of your details seriously at ActivInstinct, which is why whenever we collect any details from you we will always use a secure encrypted form to do so. When you submit your details to us they are encrypted into a secure code that only we have the key to decipher.

We keep all of your personal information on a secure server and treat all information you provide us with as confidential. For added security, we do not keep any card payment details on our database. Instead, we use a secure payment gateway to verify all transactions and guard against fraud, which only passes a secure code to us that does not contain any sensitive data once it has approved the transaction.

We only use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * Processing your order(s)

  * Administering your account (if you have one)

  * Communicating the status of your order to you

  * To administer this website

  * To serve website content to you

  * To notify you of special offers, products and services that you may be interested in provided you have consented for us to do so

  * To run any competitions that you have entered

  * To administer any promotional offers or discounts that you are entitled to




We may contact you using any of the information you have provided us, such as by email or telephone for the above purposes.

We may also collect data (user information) on your browsing habits whilst on our site (such as the URL or advert you came from, the geographical area of your computer, the pages you browsed and the search terms you entered whilst on our Website). This is common when shopping online and allows us to improve our Website, your user experience and our quality of service. We will collect this information as a matter of course for all users who access our Website whether they are registered with us or not.

We may disclose your personal information to reputable third parties (such as payment processing companies or couriers) who help to process and fulfil your order. We require that these companies treat your personal information as confidential and comply fully with current UK consumer and Data Protection legislation. Aside from this, we will not pass on your personal information to any third parties unless you give us your permission to do so.

If the police or any other regulatory or government authority requests your personal or user information in relation to an investigation into suspected illegal activities, then we may be obliged to provide it to them.

We may update our Privacy policy from time to time so please check back frequently to ensure you are aware of any changes. Any questions regarding our Privacy policy or if you would like to obtain details of the personal information we hold on you, then please write to the address below. Please note that there is currently a statutory fee of £10 that we will charge if you wish to access your information.
