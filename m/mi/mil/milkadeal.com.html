<h3 class="worklet-title">Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the MilkADeal website (collectively, the "website" is located at https://www.milkadeal.com).<br><br>
Your privacy is critically important to us. At MilkADeal we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We generally don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
<li>The following explains what information we collect from you (the "User" or the "End User") and how we use that information</li>
</ul>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, LEAVE THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS THE WEBSITE.</p>
<h4>What data we collect and why</h4>
<p>Our vision is to maximize the rewards for all of MilkADeal’s members and to provide as many member benefits as possible. The key way in which MilkADeal provides value is to share with members the commissions we receive from our affiliated stores. The information we collect (name, email address, and physical address) is used to track and send the cashback payments members earn.<br><br>
Additionally, we may use information on the stores you visit or the offers you view on MilkADeal.com to select special offers that will be relevant to you. Except at an aggregate level, however, we do not share that information with our store partners or other third parties.<br><br>
Finally, MilkADeal collects data on the devices that access or attempt to access our websites. This device data is used in conjunction with a third party security partner to identify and prevent fraudulent activity and does not include personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4>Who sees your personal information</h4>
<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy notice. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.<br><br>
Only a very limited number of our employees ever have access to your personal information. We may use third‐party contractors or vendors to help us provide some of our services. If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information will be kept confidential and used only to provide those services. In addition, our affiliates, subsidiaries, service providers, and other entities may collect personal information about your browsing habits over time and across different Web sites when you use our website.<br><br>
We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or to protect us and our members from losses.<br><br>
While browsers allow you to disable the usage of cookies, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the http header from your browser or mobile application.<br><br>
If we (or one of our affiliated companies) are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice this website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
</p><h4>How we keep your information secure</h4>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to MilkADeal. MilkADeal.com uses a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you access or transmit personal information.</p>
<h4>Your privacy with MilkADeal</h4>
<p>MilkADeal will never ask for your username, password or any other personal information in an unsolicited phone call, email or letter. Further, any contact with MilkADeal customer service in which personal information is exchanged with a customer service representative will be used only for the purpose of satisfying your request. Any personal information you provide will not be recorded or used for any reason beyond that of the stated request.<br><br>
If you choose to use our referral program to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one‐time email inviting him or her to visit the site. MilkADeal stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one‐time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at support@milkadeal.com to request that we remove this information from our database.<br><br>
If we change our privacy policy, we will post a change notice to this privacy statement and other appropriate places. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it regularly. If we make changes to this policy, we will notify you, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
<h4>Your privacy with our stores and advertisers</h4>
<p>MilkADeal does not record personal information passed from our members to affiliated stores. Order information, including order numbers and amounts, may be available to MilkADeal, the store, or third party affiliate program management companies for accurate tracking purposes, but his information will not be released by MilkADeal to other parties.<br><br>
MilkADeal contains links to various other sites. Each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of MilkADeal. If you wish to receive special offers directly from a store, neither this privacy policy nor our opt-out policy applies to those communications. Instead, please refer to the relevant store's privacy and opt-out policy.</p>
<h4>Our policies on email</h4>
<p>MilkADeal sends two types of email to members: customer service emails required to maintain the MilkADeal program (like cashback credits &amp; payment notifications); and promotional emails featuring especially good offers. You may choose not to receive promotional emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in an email. <br><br>
MilkADeal does not support spamming by our members and we explicitly prohibit it in our Terms &amp; Conditions. If you would like to report an incident of spamming using our refer‐a‐friend capability, please contact us. We will investigate and take suitable action.</p>
<h4>Cookies and how are they used</h4>
<p>Cookies are small text files that a web site can write to your computer. We may use cookies to identify you and allow you to log in once to MilkADeal and shop without having to log in again. Cookies are also used by many of our merchants to identify you as a MilkADeal member. <br><br>
MilkADeal requires its members to have cookies enabled in order to accumulate cashback rewards.</p>
<h4>Your choices and responsibilities</h4>
<p>Periodically we may send you emails on new features or special offers. On every one of these emails you will be given the choice to unsubscribe from MilkADeal’s promotional mailings. Simply follow the directions in any of our emails.<br><br>
It is the member's responsibility to update and maintain accurate contact information in their account. You can make changes by visiting your account page and entering corrections. Email and street addresses that are entered into a member's personal profile page are the addresses that will be used for all contact including for sending you cashback payments. MilkADeal is not responsible for payments sent to an incorrect addresses provided by you.<br><br>
We will post all changes to this Privacy Agreement here at our site. You are responsible for checking periodically on policy updates.<br><br>
Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or our information practices. You may contact us at support@milkadeal.com.</p>
<h4>Integrity</h4>
<p>MilkADeal knows that your word is who you are and integrity is the cornerstone of any enterprise whether public, private or personal. As such, you have our word that we will protect your privacy and safeguard your shopping at all times.</p>
<h4>Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on https://www.milkadeal.com. Other websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices.
