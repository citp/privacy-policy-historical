# Privacy Policy | Milled

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



Full Stack LLC ("Full Stack") operates Milled (the "Website"). It is Full Stack's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. 

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Full Stack collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Full Stack’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how the Website’s visitors use the website. From time to time, Full Stack may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

Full Stack also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Full Stack only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below. 

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with the Website in ways that require the Website to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that the Website gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, the Website collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the Website. Full Stack does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

### Aggregated Statistics

Full Stack may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Website. For instance, Full Stack may monitor the most popular brands on the Website. Full Stack may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, the Website does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Full Stack discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Full Stack’s behalf or to provide services available at the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Full Stack will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Full Stack discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Full Stack believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Full Stack, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Website and have supplied your email address, Full Stack may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with the Website and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Full Stack takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the Website each time the visitor returns. Full Stack uses cookies to help the Website identify and track visitors, their usage of the Website, and their website access preferences. Website visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Website, with the drawback that certain features of the Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies. 

### Business Transfers

If Full Stack, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Full Stack goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Full Stack may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. 

### Ads

Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Full Stack and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Full Stack may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Full Stack’s sole discretion. Full Stack encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
