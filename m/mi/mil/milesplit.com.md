## Mile Split Privacy Policy

COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY 

Thank you for visiting the Mile Split Network. We take your security and privacy concerns very seriously. 

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

INFORMATION MILE SPLIT GATHERS AND TRACKS 

The Mile Split Network gathers two types of information about users: 

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys. 
  * Traffic information from web server log files. This information is used for statistical analysis. It is not used on a user-specific basis but rather so that we know what parts of our network are most frequently visited by what browsers and by what general demographic. 



The Mile Split Network Gathers User Information In The Following Processes: 

Optional Voluntary Information 

Certain features on our web site require users to register to become a member. Members must provide a real name and contact information. Your contact information will never be divulged to a third party except to comply with an applicable law, valid legal process, or to protect the saftey of our users or the public. 

Usage tracking 

The Mile Split Network tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We do break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). 

Mile Split sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

Cookies 

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Mile Split uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above) and is also needed to allow members to login to the sites on our network. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, or any other area requiring you to login. 

USE OF INFORMATION 

The Mile Split Network uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. 

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Mile Split never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners. 

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters. 

The Mile Split Network creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. 

SHARING OF THE INFORMATION 

The Mile Split Network uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to making our network economically feasible. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. 

SECURITY 

The Mile Split Network operates secure data networks protected by industry standard Apache web servers and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. 

OPT-OUT POLICY 

We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include: 

  * Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters. 
  * Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
