### I. INTRODUCTION 

This Privacy Policy applies to your use of websites, interactive services, email programs and mobile device applications as well as any other products, features, materials or other services provided by Sightline Media Group LLC (collectively, the “Services”). Sightline respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.

Please take a few minutes to read them before using or registering for access to our Services.

###  II. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT THROUGH OUR SERVICES ?

This Privacy Policy describes Sightline’s collection, use and disclosure of the information you provide to us through your use of the Services, as well as the rights you have with respect to your personal data. If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy please contact us at [privacy@sightlinemg.com](mailto:privacy@sightlinemg.com).

  * **Information That You Provide To Us.**
    * We will collect personal data that you voluntarily provide us when you register for the Services or interact with other users of the Services. We may collect personal data when you sign up for marketing or editorial emails; download white papers, e-books, or webcasts; or sign up for events or other opportunities through Sightline. Personal data may include your first and last name, location, phone number, gender, title, email and mailing address and demographic information. We may also ask for information about your hobbies, interests, preferences and the like, but you're free to register for our Services without providing this additional information.
    * Billing and transactional information pursuant to your use of the Services, where appropriate to process a financial transaction you request.
    * If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply.
    * When you post content (such as text, images, messages or comments) in connection with your use of the Services, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.
    * When you participate in one of surveys, we may collect additional profile information.
    * We may also collect contact information regarding other individuals when you use the sharing and referral tools available within some of our Services to forward content or offers to your friends and associates. We use this information to facilitate the communications that you request. We rely on you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to facilitate the communications that you request. You or the third party may contact us at [privacy@sightlinemg.com](mailto:privacy@sightlinemg.com) to request the removal of this information from our database. 


  * **Information Collected Using Technology**. 
    1. **Information Collected By Our Servers.** To make our Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, internet protocol (IP) address, domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
    2. **Log Files.** Like most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include IP address, internet service provider (ISP), browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Services, gather demographic information regarding our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically collected data to personal data.
    3. **Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.** Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive user experience. This type of information is collected to make our Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. You will not be able to access certain areas of our websites if your computer does not accept cookies from us. We do not respond to browser-based “do not track” signals.
    4. **Pixel Tags.** Our websites may also use small pieces of code called "pixel tags" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. Pixel tags can recognize certain types of information, such as a user's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and description of the page where the pixel tag is placed. These pixel tags may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy above.
    5. **Flash LSOs.** When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, knows as Flash Cookies to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).
    6. **Advertising On Third-Party Websites and Ad Networks.** We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on the Services and third-party websites, which may include serving or tracking advertisements on or relating to the Services. We may use the following data, whether separately or combined:
      * Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers.
      * Subscriber or visitor-provided information.
      * Data from your use of the Services (g. hashed data, click stream information, browser type, geographic location, time and date, information about your interactions with advertisements and other content).
      * Information from advertising partners. Our advertising partners may place or recognize cookies, web beacons or other technology to track certain activities about our website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the Services. An advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.
      * Information inferred from the data described above.
If you do not want this information used by third parties for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if you are located in the European Union, [click here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) or if you are in Canada, [click here](http://youradchoices.ca/choices)). Following these processes will opt you out of receiving ads that are targeted to you. You may, however, continue to receive generic ads that are targeted to the general public.
    7. **We use analytics to help analyze how users utilize the Services.** Our analytics service providers may use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Services. We use this information only to improve our Services. The analytics service providers collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, rather than your name or other personal data. We do not combine the information generated through the use of analytics with your personal data. Although the analytics service provider places a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique visitor the next time you visit the Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but that particular analytics service provider. The ability of the analytics service providers, Google Analytics and Parse.ly, to use and share information collected about your use of the Services is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy. 
    8. **Location Information** **.** Some of our mobile applications may deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the app. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store location information.


    * You can access various social network posting and sharing tools through our Services that are operated by third parties, including a “share” button that allows you to post links to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others on your social network pages. When you visit a page that includes one of these sharing tools, the third-party company that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser, device and online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own separate privacy policy, which may differ from ours.


  * **Other Third Parties**
    * We may receive personal and/or anonymous data about you from companies that offer their products and/or services through our Services and/or companies that otherwise collect such information. These third-party companies may supply us with personal data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the Services in order to improve Services we provide to you.
