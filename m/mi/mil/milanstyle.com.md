This privacy statement (“Privacy Policy”) covers all the websites and services owned, affiliated or operated by MilanStyle. (collectively “MilanStyle”, “we”, “us”, “our”). MilanStyle knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the MilanStyle websites, submitting information or using any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy you should not use the websites and services, nor should you submit personal information.

**What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers MilanStyle’s treatment of personal information that MilanStyle gathers about you when you are on the MilanStyle websites and when you use MilanStyle services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers MilanStyle’s treatment of any personal information about you that MilanStyle’s business partners share with MilanStyle. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that MilanStyle does not own or control, or to individuals that MilanStyle does not employ or manage.

**Purposes of Collecting Personal Information About Users.** Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to:

  * personalise and improve the service we provide to you;
  * respond to any emailed requests you make to us; and
  * customise advertising content and communicate with you (including, without limitation, provide you with email alerts).



We collect the following types of information from our users:

A. Information You Provide to Us:

  * We may receive and store any information you enter on our websites or provide to us in any other way, such as your nickname, name, email address, and other information you provide. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, such as posting comments to our websites, creating a user profile or receiving email alerts.
  * In order for you to use certain parts of our websites or take advantage of certain MilanStyle services, you may be required to complete a registration form and provide the requested information about you. Required information for all sites includes a nickname, email address and password. MilanStyle users also need to provide additional identifying information about their websites/blogs including URL and a description of the site.
  * When you use our websites, you may, among other things, set up your profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, create wish lists, comment and transmit information through various channels. In most cases, we retain your information so that you can return to view saved lists or sent messages. When you update your information, we usually keep a back-up copy of the prior version.
  * You post information at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on the website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your information may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your information.



B. Automatic Information:

  * We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. MilanStyle may automatically receive and record certain “traffic data” on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, MilanStyle cookie information, the page you requested, and your communications and interaction with our other website registrants. MilanStyle uses this traffic data to, among other things, help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer our websites.
  * Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites and its components. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of our websites, so we can make our websites appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our websites. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our websites, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal Web experience. We also collect and use information for internal purposes. For example, if you are a registered user of the MilanStyle email and/or subscription based services, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users online behaviour, and any reported violation of our Terms of Use that you or someone on your account may have committed.
  * Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While MilanStyle is not able to provide you with a personalised experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.



C. Email Communications:

  * We may receive confirmation via HTML code when you open an email from MilanStyle. We may also send out emails with news or promotions. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please close your MilanStyle account.



D. Information from Other Sources:

  * For purposes such as improving personalisation of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information, including details of the purchases (and any associated returns) you make at retailers where you were referred by us (excluding any credit card information).



**What about Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. MilanStyle cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
  * The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of MilanStyle’s most attractive features.
  * Some of our business partners may use cookies on our websites (for example, advertisers). These cookies allow the server to recognize your computer, for example, each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows advertising networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by our business partners or advertisers.
