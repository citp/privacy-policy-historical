**Privacy Policy**

* * *

Because we at MilePoint respect our members and understand that you are concerned about privacy, we have instituted policies and procedures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We also post this privacy policy so that our members know what kind of information we collect, how it is handled and with whom it may be shared. 

The purpose MilePoint gathers member information is to verify each member's Sponsor account information, including Sponsor mile and/or point balances, to improve the content on our Web site, to enhance your online shopping experience, and for marketing and promotional purposes. At this point, such information includes member information gathered in the course of the registration of each MilePoint member. Some of the information gathered may be shared in the aggregate with corporate affiliates of MilePoint, as well as other responsible organizations that offer products or services that we believe may enhance the experience of our MilePoint members. 

MilePoint does not sell individual member names or other private profile information to third parties and have no intention of doing so in the future. MilePoint may share general member information with our partners only for specific and pertinent promotional use but only if our members have opted to receive such information. 

As we continue to develop our Web site and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, this policy likely will change. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. For additional information about protecting your privacy, please see the Frequently Asked Questions section. 

**Information Collection and Use**  
MilePoint is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. As we have stated we will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. MilePoint collects information from our members at the registration page of our Web site. 

**Registration**  
In order to use the benefits of this Web site, a member must first complete the on-line registration form. During registration a member is required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address and Sponsor account information). This information is used to allow the member to use the services on our site. Members may provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and other unique identifiers (such as social security number), however this information will only be used to enhance the member's experience at our site. 

**Links**  
This Web site is designed to contain links to numerous other sites. Please be aware that we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our members to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by MilePoint. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**  
If a member's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a member no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that member's personal data provided to us. This can be done at the member registration page or by e-mailing our Customer Support.
