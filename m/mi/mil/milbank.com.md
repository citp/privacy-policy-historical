** ** **Where we store and transfer your personal information**

This website is hosted in the United States.  If you are located in another country, any personal information that we collect about you through this website will be transferred to, and stored in, the United States.

Some of the service providers we use to store personal information are located in the United States or other countries that are not recognized under European Union data protection law as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data.  In order to comply with European Union data protection law, we put in place agreements with these service providers based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.  You can obtain a copy of these clauses from us – please see the **Contact us** section, below, for further details about how to contact us.

We may also transfer your personal information internationally in order to meet our legal or regulatory obligations, where this is necessary for the exercise, establishment or defence of legal claims, or in other circumstances permitted by applicable data protection law.

**How we protect your personal information**

In order to protect personal information, we maintain an Information Security Policy which includes various policies and standards related to passwords, remote access, access control, encryption, change management, electronic communications, business continuity, incident management, third party access, vendor management, physical security and acceptable use.  We are ISO27001:2013 certified.

We employ multiple technology and security solutions to safeguard our networks and data.  These include dual layer firewalls, web and email content inspection, scanning and filtering, antivirus software, malware protection, host intrusion detection and prevention, zero day threat prevention and application control software.  We support transport layer security (TLS) encryption for secure email communications.  We also encrypt all firm-managed laptop, desktops and USB device hard drives.  In some cases data leak prevention is used to prevent data exfiltration.

We maintain a security patching process where patches are periodically applied based on regular maintenance schedules or immediately, as needed, based on threat and vulnerability exploitation levels to ensure that personal data is protected adequately.

We have a cyber security incident response plan that addresses how to handle actual or potential cyber security breaches throughout their lifecycle.  This includes internal and client communications plans and third party breach notifications based on regulatory requirements and the nature and scope of each incident. 

**How long we keep your personal information**          

We retain personal information in accordance with applicable law and regulation and our records retention policy based on these laws and regulations.  The period for which we keep your personal information is determined by a number of criteria, including our legal and regulatory obligations, the purposes for which we are using the information, the amount and sensitivity of the information, and the potential risk from any unauthorised use or disclosure of the information.
