  |   | Please note that the provision of some information will be necessary in order for us to take action regarding an order for products or services that you have purchased. For example, we need your address to be able to send you the product you ordered. Our online forms clearly identify which fields are required in order for us to complete the transaction.

For profiling purposes, we use data that we receive from you as part of our business relationship. This includes personal data like your purchasing behaviour and browsing behaviour.
