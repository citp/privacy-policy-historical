We can be contacted using the form &gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="../form/email-milesfaster.htm">here</a><br>

At milesfaster.co.uk we take your privacy as seriously as you would 
yourself. Below we explain the types of information we collect, why we collect 
	it and at 
what stage this information is gathered.<br>
<br>
For each visitor to our Website, our 
Web server (the computer on which our website is served from) automatically 
recognises your IP addresses (known as internet protocol), 
your browser type, referring/exit pages (often blocked on the client 
side by your security software) and operating system. The information is 
coated and stored in server log files and this is normal 
practice for standard websites (just about every commercial website on the 
internet). These logs are stored for one month and then securely 
deleted. <br>
This information is not linked to personally identifiable information or data.<br>
The data we gather in this way is used for internal review only to help improve 
the website experience and the information is then securely electronically 
deleted after one month.<br>
<br>
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via 
e-mail to more efficiently deal with that current and any further correspondence 
from that client. We do not sell, rent or trade that information to any 
other 
party.<br>
<br>
For any personal information supplied to us electronically or other by 
other means, you will only receive communication in connection with, and 
relevant to, that original correspondence.<br>
<br>
If you make a hotel booking through this website you will be asked for 
the following information: Name, home or work telephone number, fax 
number, email address, credit card number and its expiration date, and 
your credit card billing address.<br>
If you make a reservation for other people you will be asked for 
identifiable information for these other parties. You should obtain 
permission from these individuals to provide their information. <br>
The information is necessary in order to process your reservation and 
confirm back to you that this has been successfully completed. The 
information is then used to identify you should you wish to query and/or 
change details of your reservation. <br>
<br>
Cookies (text files placed on your hard drive): These are used to record 
session information only at the point you choose to click through a 
booking/quote request page. This website does not use cookies until the client 
has chosen to click through a rates check page.<br>
The information stored is used to speed up 
the user experience by means such as auto filling requested dates and 
logins.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server 
companies. <br>
<br>
Upon request we provide site visitors with access to communications that 
the consumer/visitor has directed to our site (e.g., e-mails, customer 
inquiries).<br>
<br>
Upon request we offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies 
corrected in contact information.<br>
<br>
Security: When sensitive information is requested such as credit card 
numbers SSL secure encrypted transmission is used. This is signified by 
the prefix https in your browser address bar and a padlock/security logo 
in your browser window.<br>
<br>
External links: At various points of our website we link out to external 
websites. Normally these are for information purposes. Our privacy 
policy covers our website only and for external websites you should 
check their individual privacy policy.</div><br>
