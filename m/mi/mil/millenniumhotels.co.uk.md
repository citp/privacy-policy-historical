# Privacy Policy | Millennium & Copthorne Hotels | Privacy Policy

**The Millennium Hotels Privacy Policy and Disclosure Policy**

Millennium Hotels and Resorts ("Millennium"), as it is permitted by law to do, directly, or through its third-party vendors, collects on or from this website certain information provided by its customers so that it can provide its hotel services and products, including the ability to make and accept reservations for its worldwide portfolio of Hotels (the "MHR Hotels") on-line.

The Millennium Websites (as defined below) also allow customers to communicate with Millennium on issues of customer service and to provide feedback on services. Millennium sometimes uses this customer information to analyse customers' interests so that it can tailor programs and special offers to better address its customers' needs.

A list of website names ("URLs") to which this Policy applies is set forth below.  These websites shall be referred to collectively as the "Millennium Websites":

•    www.millenniumhotels.com  
•    www.millenniumhotels.co.uk  
•    www.millenniumhotels.com.sg  
•    www.millenniumhotels.co.nz  
•    www.millenniumhotels.ae  
•    www.millenniumhotels.com.cn

**Categories of Information Millennium Collects**

**Reservations  
**To process a reservation for a MHR Hotel, Millennium will ask for the customer's name, mailing address, billing address, electronic-mail information, telephone number, credit-card information, arrival and departure dates, and airline frequent-flier information or information on similar customer-loyalty programs. Millennium also asks for the customer's room preferences and any special requests or needs.

**Customer Service  
**When Millennium customers make customer-service requests, Millennium will ask for the customer's name, mailing address or electronic-mail information, telephone number and other information that will allow Millennium to respond to the request or to resolve any problems at our MHR Hotels.

**Electronic Surveys  
**Millennium conducts online surveys, from time to time, to evaluate its services. Participation in such surveys is voluntary, but customer information is collected during such online surveys for verification purposes, such as name, mailing address, and electronic mail address.

**Contests  
**MHR Hotels sometimes offer special promotions, contests, or sweepstakes through which customers can win prizes. Each of these promotions, contests and sweepstakes will have a set of terms and conditions that apply to that event. In some cases, the customer is automatically entered in the contest simply by using the Millennium Websites or meeting some other condition for that contest. In entering such a promotion, contest, or sweepstake, the customer's name, electronic-mail address, or other personal information will be collected to identify the customer and for notification purposes.

**Cookies  
**Millennium takes your privacy very seriously and has in place a policy for the responsible use of cookie technology, which is used to remember customer preferences and enhance the user experience.  


"Cookies" are bits of electronic information (strings of text) that a computer user's browser and operating system store on the user's computer hard drive. For example, cookies can store a user's electronic personal identification and password, identify which parts of a website the user visits, and keep track of purchases or selections the user made on visits to the Millennium Websites. The use of cookies is quite common.

Millennium may issue and use cookies to enhance the customer's visit and the services offered on the sites. Websites often consist of many pages of content. Cookies allow the customer to find the information and offers of interest quickly and easily. The use of cookie technology may help Millennium to achieve that objective.

Millennium may issue and use cookies to keep track of the areas of the Millennium Websites that interest customers. In doing so, Millennium can determine aspects of its websites that are most popular. Improvements and updates to the Millennium Websites are often based on such data. This information can be tracked best with cookies.

Customers who visit the Millennium Websites may be presented with targeted advertising and special offers both directly through the website and from electronic mail based on preferences collected by cookies.

Customers who register under the Millennium Websites and allow their computers to accept cookies provide information by which Millennium can both align the customer with his or her personal preferences and provide faster and easier access to the Millennium Websites' benefits.

Customers who submit electronic-mail addresses may receive targeted messages that Millennium believes may be of interest to these customers. Any customer may, at any time, request to be removed from such electronic lists and Millennium will comply with the request.

Customers can choose to accept or reject cookies by modification to their computer browser. These options are generally set forth in files or menus listing "Internet Options".

**Millennium & Copthorne Loyalty Club  
**Enrolment on the Millennium & Copthorne Loyalty Club ("MCLC") is voluntary, and subject to a customer meeting the MCLC eligibility criteria. The information provided by a customer to MCLC for the purpose of registration may be accessed, reviewed and updated any time upon the successful application for membership. This can be done via the MCLC website (by logging in with the customer's confirmed membership number and password) and clicking on "Update my Profile".

**Use of Information Collected  
**Millennium may share the customer information it collects with its personnel and with the owners and operators of the MHR Hotels. Millennium may also share the customer information with selected third parties who offer goods or services that may be of interest to the MHR customers. Millennium may also share such information with other companies with whom it has entered into cooperative or co-sponsored promotions for products or services. When customers use credit cards to purchase goods or services, Millennium may share information provided by customers with the relevant credit card company.

**Legal Requirements  
**Millennium will also disclose customer information, without first seeking or obtaining the customer's permission, if Millennium believes, in good faith, that such disclosures are required by any applicable law or pursuant to any court order or if such disclosures are necessary to investigate activities that may be harmful or injurious to the Millennium Websites, to MHR Hotel guests, employees, or agents, or to any MHR Hotel.

**Service Providers  
**Millennium relies on third parties to provide services both through the Millennium Websites and in other communications. While Millennium requires such providers to conform to these privacy policies and guidelines, Millennium cannot control and shall not be responsible for their conduct if they fail to abide by these policies and guidelines.

**Third Party Websites  
**Millennium cannot control and is not responsible for the collection of personal information by third-party websites, including websites owned or controlled by hotel room sellers, travel companies, or other distributors or any websites not controlled or authorised by Millennium.

Customers may be able to access third-party websites through links on the Millennium Websites. Such third-party websites have their own separate privacy practices and policies. Millennium has no control over and no responsibility or liability for the practices and policies implemented by such third parties on their websites. Certain third-party websites may have received permission from Millennium to use certain trademarks owned by Millennium, but may not provide a link to this Privacy Policy nor are these third party websites authorised by Millennium to make disclosure of any customer information. Customers should communicate directly with such third party websites to get information about their privacy practices and policies.

This Policy and Disclosure does not cover customers who enter the Millennium Websites through links from non-Millennium or non-MHR sites, such as those of advertisers or other content providers.

**Privacy Policy Changes  
**Millennium reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy and Disclosure Policy. Millennium will post such revisions by a link on the Millennium Websites.

**Effective Date  
**This Privacy Policy and Disclosure became effective as of July 1, 2004.
