If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your personal information and, if so, provide you with a copy of that personal information (along with certain other details). If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.

### 14.2  Your right to rectification.

If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to have it rectified. If we have shared your personal information with others, we will let them know about the rectification where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we have shared your personal information so that you can contact them directly.

### 14.3  Your right to erasure.

You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information in some circumstances, such as where we no longer need it, if you withdraw your consent (where applicable), or where you close your My Millennium loyalty programme or Millennium for Business account (as applicable).  However, note that we may retain some of your personal information for a reasonable period of time, even after you withdraw a consent or close your My Millennium loyalty programme or Millennium for Business account (as applicable), for legal or compliance purposes. If we have shared your personal information with others, we will let them know about the erasure where possible. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we will also tell you with whom we have shared your personal information so that you can contact them directly.

### 14.4  Your right to restrict processing.

You can ask us to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of that personal information or you object to us processing it. It would not stop us from storing your personal information, though. We will tell you before we lift any restriction. If we have shared your personal information with others, we will let them know about the restriction where it is possible for us to do so. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we will also tell you with whom we have shared your personal information so that you can contact them directly.

### 14.5  Your right to data portability.

You have the right, in certain circumstances, to obtain personal information you have provided to us (in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format) and to reuse it elsewhere or to ask us to transfer this to a third party of your choice.

### 14.6  Your right to object.

You can ask us to stop processing your personal information, and we will do so, if we are:

  * _relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interests to process your personal_ _information, except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing; or_
  * _processing your_ _personal information for direct marketing._



### 14.7  Your rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.

You have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automatic processing, including profiling, if it produces a legal effect or similarly significantly affects you.  However, we may conduct automated decision-making and/or profiling where it is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us. 

Examples of automated decision-making and/or profiling include if we use software to automatically scan employment applications and match candidates to job vacancies, or if we were to utilise an aptitude test with algorithms or automated criteria for decision-making in our recruitment process.

### 14.8  Your right to withdraw consent.

If we rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.

### 14.9  Your right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.

If you have a concern about any aspect of our privacy practices, including the way we have handled your personal information, you can report it to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). You can find details about how to do this on the ICO website at <https://ico.org.uk/concerns/> or by calling their helpline on 0303 123 1113.
