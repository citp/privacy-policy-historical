					<p style="line-height: 150%">This policy is effective as 

					of June 17, 2013.</p>

					<p style="line-height: 150%">Welcome to the Microworkers 

					Service, a web service utility that connects employers and 

					workers on a micro level. The Microworkers service is 

					operated by Weblabcentercom, Inc. and its subsidiaries and 

					affiliates ("us," "we", &nbsp;"Microworkers", “site” or 

					“Microworkers.com”). By using or accessing the Microworkers 

					Service, you agree that you have read, understand and are 

					bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). We reserve the right, 

					at our sole discretion, to change or delete portions of 

					these Terms at any time without further notice. Your 

					continued use of the Microworkers Service after any such 

					changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
