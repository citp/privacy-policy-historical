**List Exchange Policy**

Long-term support from our individual members is critical to fulfilling Michigan Public Media's mission of service to the community. Maintaining and preserving a strong, trusting relationship with our members is key to this vital source of support.

Finding more individuals to join in supporting our services is also vital to the long-term success of our organization. Individuals who have contributed to organizations similar to ours are among the most likely to also be loyal supporters of Michigan Public Media. Access to lists of donors to these community organizations is also a vital element of our efforts to raise the money needed to provide our services.

Balancing the needs and desires of our contributors along with meeting the need for efficient and effective fundraising practices are the principles that serve as the underpinning of our list exchange policy. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that we conduct our fundraising in compliance with nationally established guidelines while ensuring that our member's trust and faith in us is well placed and deserved.

Michigan Public Media will, on occasion, rent membership lists from other well-established charitable, cultural non-profit, or other organizations. We will not rent member's names from any candidate for public office, committees or organizations supporting a candidate, political parties, or organizations that solicit funds for use in political campaigns for any purpose. We believe that the opportunities for increased financial support and the cost reductions resulting from list exchanges conducted within the guidelines of this policy will help us deliver more and higher quality mission-related services to the public.

In acquiring lists, the following principles will always apply:

  * We will maintain complete and accurate records of the origins of membership and potential donor lists for at least such time as required by law.
  * We may enter into agreements with outside companies in fulfillment of member premiums or an "affinity" program, such as the Membercard. We will only enter into an "affinity" program which would offer our members a quality product at or below market price.

We will not rent lists from any organization if we believe doing so may endanger the trust between Michigan Public Media and its members. 

We will comply with the laws and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, the State of Michigan, the University of Michigan, the United States Postal Service, and the certification requirements of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 

If you have questions regarding this policy, please contact us: [info@michiganpublicmedia.org](mailto:info@michiganpublicmedia.org) or write us at 535 W William St., Ann Arbor, MI 48103.
