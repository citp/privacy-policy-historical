Session cookies allow you to move through many pages of a website quickly and easily without having to authenticate or reprocess each new area you visit.  Session cookies are destroyed after successful completion of a transaction, after a few minutes of inactivity, or when the browser is closed.

If you choose to do so, you can configure your browser to notify you when a new cookie is received.  You can also view and delete existing cookies, prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, and disable cookies altogether.  If you disable cookies, you can still use Michigan.gov, but your ability to use some areas or functions of the website may be limited.

**Sharing information**

We will only share personal information about you with others if: 

  * We have your consent to share the information, or
  * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested, or
