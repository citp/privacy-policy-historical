                    <p>Michael Page International Ltd and our related companies worldwide ("Michael Page International") are committed to protecting the privacy of our candidates, clients and other users of our websites and services.</p>
<p>Where you provide us with your personal data, in person, by email, through this website or through any of our other international websites or offices, we will endeavour to ensure that such information remains private and is only used in accordance with this policy. By providing us with your personal data, you also consent for us to collect, hold, use and disclose your personal&nbsp;data in accordance with this policy.

<p>(h)<span>&nbsp;to different parts of the Michael Page International Group worldwide to enable the development and marketing of other products and services and to improve our customer service and to make our services more valuable to you, including tailoring our website when you log on to make it relevant to you personally;</span></p>
<p>(i)<span>&nbsp;to trusted third parties where we have retained them to provide services that you have requested, such as psychometric evaluations or skills tests, and who also provide services to us, such as professional advisers, IT consultants, mailing houses and function co-ordinators. These third parties must comply with similar undertakings of privacy and confidentiality as Michael Page International;</span></p>

We only use such data in aggregate form (that is, the information does not identify any one individual). This information helps us determine the most beneficial parts of our websites and ways in which we can continually improve our online services to create a better overall experience for our users. We also publish some of this aggregate (non-identifiable) information on the Michael Page International websites worldwide.</p>
<p>(d) Cookies</p>
<p>A cookie is a small data file which is sent from our web server to your individual web browser when your browser visits our server's website. You can find out more about the use of cookies on <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/"><span>http://www.allaboutcookies.org</span></a>. Cookies are used on Michael Page International websites to remember your login details, to track web traffic on an aggregate basis and to keep session information in cache to assist your use of our website, such as your last search (however, this information is disposed of every time you close your web browser). Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies (see the help menu on your browser), however, switching off cookies will restrict your use of our websites.</p>
<p><strong>4. Access to Personal Data<br></strong>You may request access to or updating of your personal&nbsp;data held at Michael Page International by contacting the Michael Page International privacy officer as set out below. We may ask to verify your identity and for more information about your request. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request and give you reasons for doing so. Where you request your personal&nbsp;data to be updated and there is a dispute about the facts, we will make a note on your personal&nbsp;data of such dispute. You may also request that Michael Page International stops using your information and contacting you and we will comply with your request. However, if this involves a request for deletion of your file, please be aware that we may not be required or able to do so, particularly where your file also holds information about our clients. Where permitted to do so, we&nbsp;may charge an administrative fee for access and updating requests.</p>
<p><strong>5. Security<br></strong>Michael Page International takes reasonable steps to keep personal&nbsp;data secure, accurate and up to date. The Internet is not always a secure method of transmitting information. Accordingly, while we seek to protect your personal&nbsp;data by implementing digital security systems in various parts of our website, Michael Page International cannot accept responsibility for the security of information you send to or receive from us over the Internet or for any unauthorised access or use of that information. Where we have links to websites outside the Michael Page International Group, we cannot ensure that your privacy will be protected in accordance with this policy. You should consult these other websites' privacy policies as we have no control over them and are not responsible for any information that is submitted to or collected by these third parties.</p>
