		<div class="widget">			<div class="textwidget">Important Note:  You can make money online.  Thousands of people are doing it every single day.  However, it's important to understand that making money online from home doesn't happen over night.

As in everything we do, even with a blueprint,  you must work at it and put in the time to learn.  There is risk involved in everything including making money from home.  Not everyone who tries this will make as much money as I do and in fact it possible you won't make anything at all.

The more time and practice you put in the more chance of success you have.  Get rich schemes do not exist and anything I talk about is not claimed to be one.  If you're looking to get rich over night you're on the wrong site.  If you're looking to build a long lasting affiliate marketing business and understand the last couple of paragraphs you're in the right place.</div>

<strong>3. POLICY IS  PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE.</strong><br>
Our privacy policy is part of, and subject to, our website’s terms and conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions on our website.</p>

<strong>4. THE TYPE  OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU.</strong><br>
Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic information such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website, your computer’s operating system, and the type of web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records this basic information about you.<br>
And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this means information that our website’s server transfers to your computer. This information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies may also be used to customize our website content for you as an individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.<br>

You may choose to provide personal information to website visitors or other third parties who are not our suppliers. Please use caution when doing so. The privacy policies and customs of these third parties determine what is done with your information.</p>
<p><strong>9. AUTORESPONDERS.</strong><br>
