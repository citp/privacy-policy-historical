        <div class="pst freeform"><h3>Microsoft Press Store privacy statement</h3>
<p><strong>Last updated: April 2014</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies 
to the data collected by Microsoft through the Microsoft Press Store site (the "Site" 
or "Website") hosted for Microsoft by Pearson. This privacy statement does not apply 
to other online or offline Microsoft sites, stores, products, or services. Similarly, 
this privacy statement does not apply to the products or services that you may 
purchase through the Website, unless those products and services specifically 
reference this privacy statement.</p>

<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>Collection of your information</strong></h3>
<p>We will ask you when we need information that allows us to contact you. The 
personal information we collect may include your name, email address, phone number, 
and postal address. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP or 
postal code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make 
a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional 
information, such as your credit card number and billing address which is used to 
create a billing account. If you choose to participate in these activities, we may 
also collect information from you that you provide in response to surveys or that you 
provide in connection with a contest.</p> 

<p>We may collect information about your visit to the Website. For example, we may use 
Web site analytics tools to retrieve information from your browser, including the site 
you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our Website, the pages you view within the Website, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends 
to every Web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, 
access times and referring Web site addresses. We may use information from your 
browser, such as language choice, to improve your customer experience, for example by making our Website accessible to you in your preferred language where possible.</p>

<p>In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Microsoft, information collected through one Microsoft service may 
be combined with information obtained through other Microsoft services. We may also 
supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies.
For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a 
general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain 
services to your geographic area.</p>

<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>Use of your information</strong></h3>
<p>The information collected on the Website will be used to operate the Website and to 
provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or 
authorized, to include sending you a reminder if you have items in your shopping cart. 
We may also use this information to provide customer support, to facilitate returns 
and exchanges, to respond to questions or complaints, to conduct customer surveys, to 
detect and prevent fraud and for other purposes described in this privacy 
statement.</p><p>In support of these uses, Microsoft may use your information to provide you with 
more effective customer service, improve the Website and any related Microsoft 
products or services, perform statistical analysis, and make the Website easier to use 
by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by 
customizing the Website to your particular preferences or interests.</p>

<p>We may use your information to provide you with important information about the 
product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about Microsoft Press 
Store products, services, events and promotions, as well as the same information for 
other Microsoft products and services. Also with your permission, we may share your 
personal information with Microsoft partners so they may send you information about 
their products and services.</p>

<p>Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our 
behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing, surveys and delivering prizes, 
answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information 
about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those 
companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required 
to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that 
information for any other purpose.</p>

<p>We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your 
communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or 
legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, 
including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the 
services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is 
necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers or the 
public. We may also disclose personal information as otherwise permitted by law and as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.</p>

<p>Information that is collected on the Website may be stored and processed in the 
United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, 
or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor 
framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, 
use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>

<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>Control of your personal information</strong></h3>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this statement or with your permission, personal 
information you provide to Microsoft on the Website will not be shared outside of 
Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>

<p>You can stop the delivery of future promotional email from Microsoft sites and 
services by following the specific instructions in the email you receive. </p>

<p>Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Website will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Microsoft in the context of other, separately operated, Microsoft websites, products or 
services.</p>

<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>Access to your personal information</strong></h3> 
<p>You can review and edit the personal information you provided at the Website by 
signing into the Microsoft Press Store website. In order to help prevent your personal 
information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign in with your 
credentials (email address and password).</p>


<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>Security of your information</strong></h3>
At Microsoft, we take the security of your personal information very seriously. We use 
a variety of security technologies and procedures on our Websites to help protect your 
personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, for 
our Website, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with 
limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, if we transmit 
sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we 
protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
protocol.<p></p>

<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>Cookies &amp; similar technologies</strong></h3>
<p>Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your 
hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in 
the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of 
numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other 
information as well. Here is an example of the text stored in a cookie that Microsoft 
might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: 
E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801</p>

<p>We may use cookies for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storing your Preferences and Settings.</strong> If you enter your city or 
postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store 
that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local 
information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the 
need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site. </li>

<li><strong>Sign-in and Authentication.</strong> When you sign in to a site or service 
using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed 
in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page 
to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, 
these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the 
sign-in experience. For example, your email address may be stored in a cookie that 
will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your email address 
to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time 
you sign in. In addition, we use cookies to store items in your Shopping Cart between 
visits. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be 
stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this 
cookie will not be used.</li>
<li class="m-b-3"><strong>Site Analytics.</strong> We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.<br><br>
Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is 
not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. 
If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:</li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr><td><strong>Cookie name</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>MUID</td><td>Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for 
advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ANON</td><td>Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify 
which ads a user may like. It is also used to preserve a user’s choice to opt out of 
behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the 
opt-out with his or her Windows Live ID.</td></tr>
<tr><td>CC</td><td>Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address 
lookup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Windows Live ID authentication</td><td>Authentication cookies (e.g., PSTAuth, 
MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Windows Live ID.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NAP</td><td>Contains an encrypted version of the user’s country, ZIP code, 
age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user's Windows Live 
profile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MH</td><td>Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an 
advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>ACH01</td><td>Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TOptOut</td><td>Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want 
to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p <li="" class="m-t-2">In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties' web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read 
their own cookies on your hard drive.</p>
 
<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>How to control cookies</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser Controls to Block Cookies.</strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block 
cookies.<br><br>
For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps:<br>
<ol>
<li>Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"</li>
<li>Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window</li>
<li>Move the slider up or down to select the types of cookies you wish to block</li>
</ol>
Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_new">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.<br><br>
Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you will not be able to add items 
to your shopping cart, proceed to checkout, or sign in or use other interactive 
features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising 
preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.</li>
<li><strong>Browser Controls to Delete Cookies.</strong> If you accept cookies, you 
can delete them later.<br><br>
For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following 
steps:<br>
<ol>
<li>Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"</li>
<li>On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button</li>
<li>On the pop-up, select the box next to "Cookies"</li>
<li>Click the "Delete" button</li>
</ol>
Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_new">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.<br><br>
Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences 
controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and 
may need to be recreated.</li>
<li><strong>Browser Controls for "Do Not Track" and Tracking Protection.</strong> Some newer browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites' privacy practices.<br><br>
Internet Explorer 9 has a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the 
web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party 
content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will 
block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site 
to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the 
information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a 
Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or 
preference to the web sites you visit. For more information about Tracking Protection 
Lists and how to find them, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or 
Internet Explorer Help.</li>
<li class="m-b-1"><strong>Advertising Opt-Out Controls.</strong> Because cookies may be used for 
many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to 
accept cookies but opt out from that particular use. Companies in the online 
advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users' 
privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from 
receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies 
(including Microsoft). These pages include:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_new">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></li>
<li>Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_new">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a></li>
</ol>
Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus 
more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft's advertising preference 
and opt-out controls are available at <a href="http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/">http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/</a>. Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from being collected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>Our use of web beacons</strong></h3>
<p>Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons–sometimes called single-pixel gifs–that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>

<p>Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us 
compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations. These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. We prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information. Nevertheless, you may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies by clicking the links for each of the following analytics providers:</p>

</ul>

<h3 class="font-plus-2"><strong>Other similar technologies</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other 
technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be done to 
maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files 
locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier 
for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. These technologies 
include Local Shared Objects (or "Flash cookies") and Silverlight Application 
Storage.</p>
<ul>
