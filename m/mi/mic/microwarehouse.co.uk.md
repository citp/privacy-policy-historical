## What information we collect and how

The information we collect via this website may include:

  1. Any personal details you type in and submit, such as name, address, email address, etc.
  2. Data which allows us to recognise how you use this website. (see cookies below)

## What we do with your information

  2. To carry out security checks (this may involve passing your details to a credit reference agency, who will check details we give them against public and private databases and may keep a record of that check to use in future security checks - this helps to protect you and us from fraudulent transactions).

We may use third parties to carry out certain activities, such as processing and sorting of data, monitoring how customers use our site and issuing our emails for us.

## Other Websites

This privacy policy only covers this website. Any other websites which may be linked to our website are subject to their own policy, which may differ from ours.

## Cookies

We can enhance the service if we learn about what you like and don't like. Microwarehouse assigns a number to each user to help us personalise the service for you. This number is saved on your computer and is called a 'cookie'. It is not possible to identify a particular user by means of a Cookie alone. You can be assured of anonymity. We will not know who you are, even if we issue a Cookie.

Of course if you want, you may choose not to accept or to delete the cookie that is held on your computer. The cookie is also used for anonymously recording what parts of the service you use. Overall, aggregated usage information from all our customers helps us improve Macwarehouse by showing us how different areas of the site are being used. 

Usage information may also be used to target advertising so you view ads, which have the most relevance for you. We also collect certain information you enter for the purpose of creating statistics. We will not link your name or address with the data we collect for statistical purposes.
