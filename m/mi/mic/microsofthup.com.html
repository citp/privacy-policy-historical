For example, certain pages of this      Online Store contain Privacy Notices providing details about the personal      information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and      choices you may have about the ways we use that information.  Our Privacy      Notices apply only to the Digital River Online Store on which they appear.</span></p>    <p>&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;  color:black">Country-Specific Notices</span></b></p>    <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;  color:black">Privacy requirements vary from country to country.

Your      use of this Online Store following any such change constitutes your agreement      that all personal information collected from or about you through this Online      Store after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms      of the revised Privacy Policy. </span></p>    <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;  color:black">To alert you to these changes, we will update the effective date      of this Privacy Policy.

The information we receive depends on the settings on your web      browser.

We use this non-personal information      primarily to create statistics that help us improve the Digital River Online      Stores and make them more compatible with the technology used by our      visitors.   However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits      to this Online Store (for example, by making a purchase), we may link the      information provided by your browser to information that identifies you      personally and use it for the purposes described below.  In addition, we may      review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into      our network.  If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs      -- which contain visitors’ IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative      authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals. </span></p>    <p class="MsoBodyText3"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;">Information Provided by Third      Parties</span></i><span style="font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;">.

A “cookie” is a small text file that is transferred to your      computer by our web server.  We may use two types of cookies -- “session cookies”      and “persistent cookies”. </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:  &quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;"> </span></p>    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;color:#333333">Session      Cookies</span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;  color:#333333">.  A “session cookie” is a temporary cookie that expires when      you close your browser.  A session cookie assigns a randomly-generated, unique      identification number to your computer when you access one of our Sites.       Assigning your computer a number facilitates the proper functioning of the      features of our Online Stores, by permitting us to maintain a persistent      “state” for your session, such as, maintaining the contents of your shopping      basket during checkout.  We also use session cookies to collect information      about the ways visitors use this Online Store – which pages they visit, which      links they use, and how long they stay on each page.  We analyse this      information (known as “click-stream information”) to better understand our      visitors’ interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of      this Online Store. </span></p>    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;color:#333333">Sessions      cookies do not contain your personal information.  If, however,</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;"> you have created a      user identity on one of your visits to this Online Store, we may link the      session cookie identification number to information that identifies you      personally.</span></p>    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;color:#333333">Persistent      Cookies.</span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;  color:#333333"> When you visit one of our Online Stores, we may place one or      more “persistent cookies” on your computer.  Unlike a “session cookie,” a      persistent cookie does not expire when you close your browser.  It stays on      your computer until it expires (for example, at the end of the calendar year)      or until you delete it. </span></p>    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;color:#333333">Some      persistent cookies simply “tag” your computer so that the next time you visit      (or someone using your computer visits), our server will recognise you, not by      name, but by the “tag” on your computer.  This will enable us to provide you      with a personalised experience even if we do not know who you are.  It will also      allow us to collect more accurate information about the ways people use this      Online Store, for example, how people use this Online Store on their first      visit and how often they return.  If, at some point, you create a user      identity, </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;">we      may link the information collected by these persistent cookies to information      in our database that identifies you personally.  We may also transfer this      information to a cookie and place it on your computer’s hard drive so that our      web server can read this information each time you visit this Online Store.  In      either case, using persistent cookies permits us to provide you with a more      personalised shopping experience and, in some cases, may save you the trouble      of re-entering information already in our database. </span></p>    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;">If you do not wish      to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you      when a cookie is placed on your computer.  You may also delete our cookies as      soon as you leave our Online Store.  Although you are not required to accept      our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to      use all of the features and functionality of this Online Store.  For example,      you will not be able to purchase products and services on this Online Store.</span></p>    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;;color:#333333">Web      Beacons</span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;">.

However, if you have created a user      identity on one of your visits to this Online Store, for example, by making a      purchase, we may link the information we collect using Web beacons to the      information that identifies you personally and use it in the same ways as we      use the information we collect using cookies. </span></p>    <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="line-height:normal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;">How Do We Use Your      Personal Information?</span></b></p>    <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;">Digital</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;"> River</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;"> uses the      personal information we collect on this Online Store: </span></p>    <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
