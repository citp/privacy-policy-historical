# Privacy Policy | Luxury Sarasota Homes for Sale - Michael Saunders & Company®

_Last Modified: December 13, 2016_

MichaelSaunders.com (our “Website”) is operated by Michael Saunders & Company, a Florida corporation ("MSC"). MSC wants to make your online experience pleasant, convenient and safe. Your privacy is very important to us. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the information we collect about you and how we use this information.

## What Kind of Information Does MSC Collect?

Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a positive experience while you use our Website, to hear your comments, to respond to your inquiries, and to provide you with access to our services. MSC may collect both personal information (“Personal Information”) and information about your use of the Website (“Non-personal Information”). Personal Information may include your name, street address, email address and telephone number. Non-personal Information may include both: 1) technical information, such as the type of Internet browser you use, the date and time you access the website, and your Internet protocol address; and, 2) service usage information, such as your site visits and page views, records and history about transactions and preferences, such as property listings you have searched, and the demographic, geographic, and psychographic information, and other feedback you supply to us. Also, when you register or create an online account/profile with us, contact customer service, participate in our surveys, or send us testimonials, feedback or submissions, you are providing us with your personal information.

## Cookies

We also utilize cookies. Cookies are small files that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser to enable us to recognize you when you return to our website. Cookies let us identify you to provide you a personalized experience on our website. We use cookie and web beacon technology to track which pages on our sites our visitors view. Most Internet browsers permit you to erase or block cookies. If you configure your browser to remove or reject cookies, though, you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Website.

## How Does MSC Use My Information?

When we collect information from you, such information may be used for one or more of the following reasons:

  * Process and complete your profile and any Website transactions
  * identify your service and property listing preferences so that we can notify you of new or additional services and property listings that might be of interest to you
  * improve service offerings and customer service
  * notify you about new services, features, promotions and special offers that MSC or its affiliates thinks you will find valuable
  * provide to you newsletters
  * respond to your inquiries
  * measure the advertising effectiveness of our online and other advertisements and offers
  * customize the advertising, property listings and services you see
  * conduct research
  * help us understand Website activity and improve your use of our Website
  * collect aggregated site-visitation statistics
  * help us prevent fraud and minimize credit risk.



In order for us to maintain the accuracy of your Personal Information and improve our communication with you, we may also combine the information we collect with other public demographic information. On rare occasions we may also be required to disclose your information as is required by law pursuant to lawful requests such as subpoenas, court or agency orders, or as we may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to avert harm to persons or property, or to enforce this Privacy Policy.

## Does MSC Share My Information With Third Parties?

We may share certain Personal Information we collect about you with third parties who perform services for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example: we may use third parties to host our Website, operate certain features, send e-mails, print or mailings, authorize and process your payments, and analyze data and our advertising effectiveness. These third-party service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your Personal Information for their own or any others’ marketing purposes.

We may share Non-personal Information with select third parties on an anonymous basis (that is, in a way that does not connect your Non-personal Information to your Personal Information or disclose your Personal Information in any fashion).

If MSC, or substantially all of our assets, are sold, or MSC reorganizes or merges into another company, then customer information, including Personal Information, will likely be one of the transferred assets.

On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and as necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. Or we may need to do so to protect our customer’s rights.

## Is My Information Secure With MSC?

MSC uses security measures to protect the privacy of your Personal Information. However, transmissions over the Internet are not completely secure, and any information you send to or through our Website may be accessible by others. MSC cannot guarantee our security measures.

## How Does MSC Protect Kids' Privacy?

We are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet and will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. Users of our Website must be at least 18 years old. If you are under 18 years old, you should not provide information to us without the involvement of a parent or guardian. If a child has provided us with personal information, that child’s parent or guardian should contact us (see below) to delete such information from our records.

## Sensitive Information

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health or medical condition or criminal background) on or through the Website or otherwise to us.

## Notification of Changes

MSC may make periodic changes to this privacy policy, and we will post the changes on the Website. Please take a look at the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. We may also notify you by e-mail if there is a material change in our privacy practices or policies. Your continued use of our Website will constitute your acceptance of any such amendment.

## How You Can Access, Change or Suppress Your Personal Information?

To review, correct, update, suppress, delete, or otherwise limit our use of your Personal Information that you previously provided us, please email, call, or write us using the contact information listed below in the “Contact Us” section and clearly describe your request.

In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from our database, or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
