# MicroStrategy - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

At MicroStrategy, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit MicroStrategy on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and contact information. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.

If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with personalized information services, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. You can send your request along with your exact name, address and email address to [ info@microstrategy.com](mailto:info@microstrategy.com). We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it. We do not sell any contact data, web traffic data or web traffic analysis.

We have implemented these practices for the MicroStrategy web site - we are also instructing our employees around the world to include information on privacy practices everywhere information is collected on the MicroStrategy web, tailored to what that portion of the site does and reflecting the practices outlined here. 

The MicroStrategy site contains links to other web sites. MicroStrategy is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

We do use "cookie" technology - this is used to provide you with tailored information from our web site. A cookie is a small text-only file that is stored on your system. By definition, it cannot execute any malicious code or cause any damage to your system. Some pages on our web site use cookies so that we can better serve you when you return to our site - for example, it can "remember" your email address to save you having to enter it manually upon your return.

You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. For more information, please see [ "How to work with Cookies"](https://web.archive.org/cookies.asp).
