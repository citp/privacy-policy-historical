**Microsite Masters - Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Microsite Masters collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the http://www.micrositemasters.com website ("Site").

**Personal Information**

We may collect personal information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources that we make available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, their name, email address, phone number, address, payment information, and other information that we may deem desirable to collect for the purposes of delivering or enhancing our Site or services. Users may, however, visit our Site without providing this information. We will collect personal information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personal information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities, and they will be unable to enroll in the service that we provide.

We may use the information we collect for internal reporting services, to create reports about rankings with all identifying information and keywords removed, and to help us help you. Namely, our service is designed to help you understand where you stand with your marketing efforts and to help us know how we can better serve you. Thus, we aggregate certain personal and non personally identifiable information, in an anonymized form, to help us develop new products, services, enhance existing ones, and create reports.

**Non-personal information**

We may collect non-personal information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal information may include the browser name, the type of computer, IP address, operating system, Internet Service Provider, and other technical information about Users' means of visiting our Site.

**Web Browser Cookies**

Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance Users' experiences. Users' web browsers place cookies on their hard drives in order to allow us to distinguish user accounts for security and privacy reasons, and to conduct marketing campaigns that we think may interest certain Users. For these reasons, enabling cookies is mandatory for full functionality of our Site and service.
