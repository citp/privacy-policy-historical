<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>This Privacy Policy applies to all Web sites owned and 
              operated by Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Micron"), 
              other than Micron's Crucial Technology division whose Privacy Policy 
              may be viewed <a href="http://www.crucial.com/store/privacy.asp">here</a>.</strong></p>
            <p> Micron is committed to protecting your right to privacy when visiting 
              our Web sites. We recognize that when you share your personal information 
              with us, you expect us to treat that information in a serious and 
              responsible manner. This Privacy Policy discloses what information 
              we gather, how we use that information, and how you can correct 
              or change that information.</p>
            <p> <strong>Security</strong><br>
              Micron's sites have security measures in place to protect against 
              the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, 
              including without limitation protecting information behind a firewall 
              within a perimeter network and encrypting your ordering information 
              during transmission.</p>
            <p> <strong>Registration and Order Forms</strong><br>
              If you choose to register with Micron or to place an order with 
              us, we may ask that you provide us with contact information (first 
              and last name, email address and telephone number), financial information 
              (account or credit card numbers), demographic information (address, 
              age, or income level), and unique identifiers (tax ID number), information 
              about where you learned of our products and information about your 
              intended use of our products. We may use your contact information 
              to send you information about us and to contact you when necessary. 
              If you do not want to receive any mailings from us, please see the 
              choice/opt-out section below. Financial information is used only 
              to bill you for products. Demographic information may be used to 
              tailor your experience at our sites, showing you information that 
              we think you might be interested in, and presenting information 
              according to your preferences. We may use demographic information 
              to develop summary - but not individual - reports for our advertisers 
              so that they may determine how effective their advertising investments 
              are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked 
              on their advertisements, unless you have specifically told us that 
              this is acceptable. In addition, our sales and marketing departments 
              may also use demographic information, information about where you 
              learned of our products and information about your intended use 
              of our products to improve our advertising and marketing efforts 
              and to measure interest in our products. We may use unique identifiers 
              to verify our resellers and customers and to allow customers to 
              identify themselves to us.</p>
            <p> <strong>Surveys and Contests</strong><br>
              Micron may invite you to participate in online surveys or contests. 
              Participation is never required. If you choose to participate, you 
              may be asked to disclose contact and demographic information as 
              well as additional information about you and/or your company. We 
              may use this information to send you information about our company, 
              contact you when necessary, tailor your experience at our site, 
              display information according to your preferences and improve our 
              Web sites, products and advertising. If you do not want to receive 
              any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out section below. 
              This information may be shared with our advertisers on a summary, 
              not individual, basis. </p>
            <p> <strong>Public Forums</strong><br>
              Micron's sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or 
              news groups available to you. Because any information that is disclosed 
              in these areas becomes public information, you should exercise caution 
              when deciding whether to disclose your personal information.</p>
            <p> <strong>Information Requests</strong><br>
              You may be able to request information on our sites regarding our 
              products and services, including technical support and customer 
              service, by using online forms. We ask that you provide certain 
              contact information to allow us to fulfill your request and to send 
              you information about Micron's products and services. If you do 
              not want to receive any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out 
              section below.</p>
            <p> <strong>Children's Guidelines</strong><br>
              Micron's sites are not geared towards children. Micron does maintain 
              a few Web pages designed to provide young people educational and 
              charitable information. On all Micron sites, Micron attempts to 
              protect children. Micron must, however, rely on the information 
              provided to us by visitors to our sites. As a result, it is impossible 
              for us to guarantee with absolute certainty that the information 
              collected and utilized by Micron is or is not derived from a child. 
              The following sets forth Micron's policy with respect to the collection 
              and/or use of children's information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For purposes of this Policy, a “child” is an individual age 
                12 or younger.</li>
              <li>We do not collect children's contact information without prior 
              parental consent, which will include an opportunity for the parent 
              to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. 
              Without prior parental consent, online information will only be 
              used to respond directly to the child's request and for no other 
              purpose. </li>
              <li>We do not collect children's personally identifiable offline contact 
              information without prior parental consent. </li>
              <li>We do not distribute children's personal information to any third 
              party without prior parental consent. </li>
              <li>We do not provide the ability to publicly post or otherwise transmit 
              information that could be used to identify a child without prior 
              parental consent. </li>
              <li>We do not entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize 
              or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to 
              participate in the activity.</li></ul>
            <p> <strong>IP Addresses</strong> <br>
              We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, 
              administer our sites, and gather broad demographic information to 
              measure general interest in our products and to share with our advertisers 
              on a summary, not individual, basis. </p>
            <p> <strong>Cookies </strong><br>
              Our Web servers may place small bits of text or "cookies" 
              onto your computer's hard drive and memory. Cookies enable us to 
              identify you so you do not have to re-enter certain information 
              each time you visit our sites and allow us to keep track of your 
              shopping choices.</p>
            <p>Often we use third-party services to help us measure the effectiveness 
              of our Web site. Specifically, we use WebSideStory. This company 
              may place third-party cookies on your hard drive to help us analyze 
              the traffic on our Web site and better meet our customers' needs. 
              This does not give Micron or any other company access to your personal 
              information or other information on your computer. We do not track 
              or store any personally identifiable information. If you are concerned, 
              you can set your browser to decline third-party cookies, or you 
              can delete these cookies from your hard drive. To learn more about 
              our partnership and their privacy policies, or to opt out of receiving 
              cookies from them, go to <a href="/leaving.aspx?go=websidestory">http://websidestory.com/privacy</a></p>
            <p><strong>Agents</strong><br>
              We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions 
              on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, 
              sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information 
              from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, 
              providing search results and links (including paid listings and 
              links), and providing customer service. </p>
            <p> <strong>Supplemental Information</strong><br>
              We may supplement the information that you provide with information 
              that is received from third parties. For example, Micron may use 
              information that we purchase from a database marketing information 
              firm to enhance our understanding of the information that you provide.</p>
            <p> <strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
              Micron's sites contain links to other sites. Micron is not responsible 
              for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>
            <p> <strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong><br>
              Our sites provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving 
              communications from us at any point where we request information. 
              If you do not want to receive future communications from us, please 
              either go back to the site from which you no longer wish to receive 
              such communications or contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@micron.com">privacy@micron.com</a>. 
            </p>
            <p> <strong>Correct/Update</strong><br>
              If you want to change or modify information you have previously 
              provided to us, please either go back to the site where you provided 
              such information or contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@micron.com">privacy@micron.com</a>.</p>
            <p> <strong>Contacting the Web Site</strong><br>
              If you have any questions about Micron's Privacy Policy or the privacy 
              practices of our sites, please contact us by sending an email to

            <p><strong>Updates/Effective Date</strong><br>
              Micron reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time 
              to time. Changes to the Policy will apply to information we have 
              already received and information we receive after the revised Policy
