# Privacy Policy - Michael Page International

**Data Protection and Privacy Policy**

Michael Page International's online service is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe and secure user experience.  We will ensure that the information you submit to us via our website at [www.michaelpage.ae](http://www.michaelpage.ae/) ("The Michael Page International Site") remains private, and is only used for the purposes set out in this policy. 

**The Information We Collect and How We Use It**

Your personal details, including your name, e-mail address and CV, are held and used by us for the following purposes:

  1. For matching your coded details with job vacancies, to assist us in finding you the position that most suits you; 
  2. For keeping you informed of Michael Page services, news and wider developments in your chosen field; 
  3. For tailoring the version of our website you see when you log on to make it relevant to you; and/or 
  4. For compiling salary and other surveys of our candidates.



 **Disclosures of your information**

We will share your information within the Michael Page International group of companies where necessary in order to provide you with our recruitment services. 

It is possible that Michael Page International could merge or be acquired by another business. If this happens, we may share the information that relates to you with the new owners of the business and their advisers. You will be sent notice of such an event.

Your CV and related information will be sent to prospective employers but only where you give your consent. Such employers may be located both inside and outside the United Arab Emirates.

We may also release information relating to you to regulatory or law enforcement authorities, if required to do so. We also reserve the right to disclose the information we have collected about you to our professional advisors and to other persons to the extent that Michael Page International contracts out any aspect of the operation of its recruitment agency services.  These third parties will be acting under similar undertakings of confidentiality as Michael Page International.

 **Job Alerts**

To subscribe to job alerts emails, you will be required to provide your e-mail address, which will be used for the purpose of keeping you informed, by e-mail, of the latest jobs in your nominated industry and/or industry news via job alerts.

 **Should you decide that you no longer wish to receive this information, unsubscribe links are provided in every job alert email that you receive.**

 **Curriculum vitae ("CV")**

We give you the option of submitting your CV via this website. You can do this either to apply for a specific advertised job or for consideration by our recruitment consultants for positions as they come up.  Although your CV will be stored online, it will only be accessible by Michael Page International group recruitment consultants, working both inside and outside the United Arab Emirates. Your CV will also be e-mailed directly to our recruitment consultants who review your details and enter them onto our central in-house database. This database, including the information relating to you, can be accessed by any of our recruitment consultants working in other offices of the Michael Page International group, both inside and outside the United Arab Emirates.

You can update your CV at any time, simply by following the same procedure to submit a new CV. Your old CV will automatically be replaced.

We gather information and statistics collectively about all visitors to this website and all of the Michael Page websites worldwide, for example, which area users access most frequently and which services users access the most.
