            <p><span class="headline_red">How do we use cookies and technology in our website?</span><br>
              Micro Center  Online sets a cookie on your computer to record certain information during your  online visit (session). No personally identifiable information is stored within  this cookie. The benefit to you is the ability to save items added to your  shopping bag and store them on our server for future reference (up to 30 days).  These cookies do not gather sensitive information like your name, address,  credit card number, etc., if you do not specifically give that information to  us voluntarily. If you have given us that information, cookies enable us to  recall it (and save you the trouble of entering it all over again) each time  you visit our site.</p>
            <p>Our web server collects the addresses of the web sites that  visitors came from before visiting our site, which browser was used to view our  site and search terms entered on our site. Without making use of any personally  identifiable information, we may track the pages visited to help us understand  how customers use our site. This helps us make decisions on how to create a  better experience for you in the future.</p>
            <p>At your option, if you delete our cookies, you will limit  our ability to personalize the site for your next visit. However, deleting a  cookie will not prevent you from visiting our site and making purchases.</p>

              Micro   Center retail stores and Micro  Center Online may provide your name, address and email address to reputable  organizations that help us to fulfill services to you on our behalf.

We may provide these marketing partners personally  identifiable information obtained from you, and this information may be  combined with other personally identifiable information, such as demographic  information, available from our records and other sources.

                      Authentic Sites like microcenter.com use a VeriSign Secure
                      Server Digital ID to offer proof of identity, to enable secure
                      communications and to encrypt translations with site visitors
                      through their web browser connections. The only way to be
                      sure of a web site's authenticity is to view the site's Digital
                      ID. Viewing a site's ID assures that you are not being "spoofed" (i.e. the site is real and not an imposter) since it contains:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The name of the company which owns the web site (e.g.
                        Micro Electronics, Inc.) </li>
                    <li>The site's registered Internet address (e.g. www.microcenter.com) </li>
                    <li>The name of the Secure Server Certification Authority
                      under which VeriSign issued the Digital ID (RSA Data Security
                      or VeriSign)</li>
