                    Authentic Sites like microcenter.com use a VeriSign Secure 
                    Server Digital ID to offer proof of identity, to enable secure 
                    communications and to encrypt translations with site visitors 
                    through their web browser connections. The only way to be 
                    sure of a web site's authenticity is to view the site's Digital 
                    ID. Viewing a site's ID assures that you are not being "spoofed" 
                    (i.e. the site is real and not an imposter) since it contains:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The name of the company which owns the web site (e.g. 
                      Micro Electronics, Inc.) </li>
                    <li>The site's registered Internet address (e.g. www.microcenter.com) 
                    </li>
                    <li>The name of the Secure Server Certification Authority 
                      under which VeriSign issued the Digital ID (RSA Data Security 
                      or VeriSign)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>To view Micro Electronics, Inc.'s Digital ID when you enter 
                    the checkout page, follow these steps for your browser:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and later: Click on the 
                      gold padlock to bring up the details of this site's Digital 
                      ID. </li>

                    address, phone number, type of business and other miscellaneous

                    to request this. If you choose not to receive mailings from 
                    us, we will not send you advertisements relating to either 
                    our online store or our local Micro Center stores. Please allow 10 business days for us to make the requested 
                    change for any email subscription. Removal from our print advertising list may take up to 2-3 months, as these lists are updated quarterly.

                  <p>If you agree that we may provide your e-mail address to our

                    that you have provided to us and the information about your

                    (such as demographic and past purchase information) available 
                    from our records and other sources and shared with marketing

                  <p>Please go to our <a href="mailing_lists.phtml">Mailing List</a>

                    described above) with marketing partners, simply LEAVE the

                    personally identifiable information (as described above) with 
                    marketing partners, you have to affirmatively act and select 
                    the YES button in answer to that question. If you choose YES 
                    to permit us to share your personally identifiable information 
                    with marketing partners and at some later point change your 
                    mind, at that time select the NO button to request that we 
                    stop sharing your personally identifiable information with 
                    third parties. (Of course, you will have to tell any third 
                    parties who are sending you marketing information at that 
                    time to stop sending you their marketing information if that 
                    is your desire.) You may also, if you prefer, write to us

                    in order to request that we stop sharing your personally identifiable

                  <p>If you agree to receive e-mail from our marketing partners, 
                    we will share with them your e-mail address and the information
