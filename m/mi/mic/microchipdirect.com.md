How is Customer Information Obtained by Microchip and How is it Used?

We receive and store information you give us. Most of the information you give us is collected when you buy products on-line, request literature/ information, participate in a contest, fill out a questionnaire/survey, participate in an on-line discussion, or complete your Customer Profile. You may give us information such as your name, address, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, financial information, employment information, application information, ideas for new projects or applications, and your buying interests. The information that you provide us is used to respond to your requests, notify you of products being shipped to you, customize your interactions with us, improve our offerings, provide materials or offers to you, allow you to participate in contests, and communicate with you. It is your choice whether or not to provide us with certain information. However, you may be unable to take advantage of many of our offers and features if we do not receive your customer information.

We also receive and store certain types of information through use of “cookies.” Some examples of information gathered this way are the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, log-in, e-mail address, password, computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, platform, and the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) used to, through, and from our Sites. We use the information gathered by “cookies” to manage and customize your on-line shopping experience and to improve our offerings.

You may also submit technical information to Microchip such as designs, ideas or data, that you transmit to or post on any of our Sites (the "Submission") for purposes not limited to contest participation. The Submission is considered and treated by Microchip as nonconfidential and nonproprietary. By providing the Submission, you grant Microchip a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable right to disseminate, display, use, modify, copy, adapt, and translate the Submission for any purpose whatsoever, whether commercial or noncommercial, throughout the world in any media. You also grant us the right to use the name you submit in connection with your Submission, if we choose. You represent and warrant in making the Submission that you own or control all rights to the Submission, and that use of your Submission will not cause injury to any person or entity including Microchip. You will indemnify Microchip for all claims resulting from your Submission.

How can I manage the information Microchip has about me?

If you want to add/update your information or preferences, please modify your Account Profile. When you update your information, we may keep a copy of your earlier information for our records.
