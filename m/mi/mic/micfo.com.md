STORED CUSTOMER DATA

1.  Every client who subscribes to Micfo's hosting services has to provide the following information, which is kept on record as the official contact details.

\- Complete postal address

\- Current telephone number

\- Individual email address

The above information is used to establish communications with the client once their sign-up is received. Micfo follows a very strict verification process as part of the credit card and PayPal fraud-detection process which involves telephoning every client, to verify the contact details provided during signup, the payment mode and the exact amount tendered to Micfo.

The above contact details are also listed while registering a domain name for the client, and for any domain transfer request placed by the client. All the domain names under the client's account will show the contact details as submitted by the client, unless stated otherwise. It is required that all clients give a valid postal address for domain registration.  
 

2.  Customers' email address will be the primary mode of contact and communication at all times. All information related to the account verification, support tickets, invoices, account mails and any other communication, including without limitation newsletter, promotional emails, Micfo related updates and/or announcements would be done through emails. Any account related or service request would have to be sent through the primary email address only as it is also used as a mode of user authentication.

The primary email address of the user will also be used as the registered administrator's contact email address whenever a domain is registered or transferred.  
 

3.  Micfo uses web cookies to store client's general Internet preference. These cookies are packets of text sent by the server to a web browser, and then recalled by the browser every time it is accessed by the server. Other purposes of collecting web data through cookies include maintaining user specific information, helping authenticate and track their sessions, to help learn about their browser choice, website preferences and general Internet browsing. However, all these would be of no use what-so-ever in the event of a client changing their browser settings.
