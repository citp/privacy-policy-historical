# The Michael J. Fox Foundation Privacy Policy

The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This statement explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way the information you provide us is collected and used. For easy and direct access, we provide a link to this statement from our home page and all other pages of the site.

The Foundation is the sole owner of and the only organization that uses the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others under any circumstances.

**"Cookies"**  
Other than the specific instances outlined in this policy, the Foundation does not collect personal information about users or how they use the site. The Foundation also does not use the information-tracking devices made possible through "cookies," small pieces of data that may be sent to your Web browser from a server and stored on your computer's hard drive.

**Online Donations**  
The Foundation collects the following information through our secure online financial-transaction pages: name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card information. This personally identifiable information is used to acknowledge receipt of your donation for tax purposes and to include you on the Foundation's mailing list if you choose to join it.

When you send a donation in honor or in memory of someone and request that an acknowledgement be sent to another individual or a family, we will use the name and address of that individual or family for acknowledgement purposes only.

**Security**  
We care about the security of your transactions and apply industry-standard practices and technologies to safeguard your credit card information. We use high-grade encryption and the secure https protocol to communicate with your browser software, which guards against interception of the credit card information you give us. We also employ several different security techniques to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the organization. The Web servers for the Foundation are located in a locked, secure environment, and computer systems are maintained in accordance with industry standards to secure information.You should be aware, however, that “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet, and third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

**Mailing List**  
The Foundation provides a separate online form to join our mailing list. The information we collect includes: name, address, e-mail address, and phone number. This information is securely stored internally and accessed only when we correspond with our mailing list periodically during the year, either via e-mail or regular mail.

Please contact us directly by regular mail if at any time you wish to be removed from the mailing list or if you would like to correct or change the personal information you have previously provided. To protect your privacy and security, we will take certain steps to verify your identity before granting access to your information or making corrections. Callers will be asked specific questions, including full name, address, phone number, and, if applicable, credit card numbers and/or expiration date, in order to verify their identity and protect the privacy of the Foundation's donors and members of its mailing list.

**Links to Other Web Sites**  
The Foundation's site includes links, some temporary and some permanent, to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy and security practices of any other Web site or the nature of the content contained therein.

**Children's Privacy**  
None of the content and information in the Foundation's Web site is targeted toward children under 13 years of age. We make every effort possible to ensure that we do not collect or maintain information on our Web site from those we know to be younger than 16 unless parental consent has been obtained in writing.

**Changes to This Policy**  
In the event that the Foundation decides to alter its privacy policy, the changes will be added directly to this statement. We will, however, always use information in accordance with the version of the privacy policy under which it was originally collected.
