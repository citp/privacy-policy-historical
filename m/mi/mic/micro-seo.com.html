        <p align="justify" class="legal"><strong>PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE STILL COVERED</strong><br>
          In the event that a person excluded from this website because of the Terms of Use or from denial of service by the website, who nonetheless unlawfully views this site, that person remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the <a href="terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="legal"><strong>PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE<br>
        </strong>This website is not lawfully accessible to persons under the age of 18 or who are otherwise covered by the provisions of the Child Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA).

        <p align="justify" class="legal"><strong>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION <br>
          IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY<br>
        </strong>Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the consideration required for your right to visit the website. If you do not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this website and you are fraudulently using this website.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="legal"><strong>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED<br>
        </strong>This website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers. This information is obtained in various ways, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="legal"><strong align="justify">VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'<br>
            </strong>Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this website. This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.<br>
            <br>
            Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing.  This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li class="legal"><strong> ONLINE ORDERING<br>
            </strong>Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers. In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVS (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.  You should consider all this information available to the website.  This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li class="legal"><strong> VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES<br>

While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website's general solicitation database.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li class="legal"><strong> CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS<br>
            </strong>If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your communication and by communicating with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit.<br>
            <br>
            Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes. <br>
            <br>
