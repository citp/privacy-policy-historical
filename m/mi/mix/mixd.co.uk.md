You should make sure that you know when you have left our web site and, if the web site you visit collects personal information, that you have read that site's privacy policy.

We may provide the information collected as stated herein to our business partners, which are under nondisclosure agreements with us not to disclose the information to anyone else, in order to assist us in growing our business with respect to similar products and services. If you do not want your information shared in this manner you will have a chance to opt out prior to collection.

We will provide the information collected in the event we are required to provide such information by a court, administrative or governmental order or subpoena or other legal process.
