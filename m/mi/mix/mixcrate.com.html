                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Please remember that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we don't own or control or to people that we don't employ or manage. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information about you.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>2.	COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br>
                    We collect Your Information at various points when you use the Site. We use the data that we collect to tailor your experience on the Site, show content that we think you might be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. 
                    </p>

                    <li>"Share" Features. If you use our optional "Share" features on the Site, we will collect the email address that you provide, in order for us to send that person an email.

                    <li>IP (Internet Protocol) Addresses. An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you requests pages from the Site, our servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. This means that your session will be logged, but you as the user remain anonymous to us. The site will identify the date, time and IP address from which you access the site when you register as a user and if you choose to opt-out of receiving emails or other communications from us.
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Log Data. Log data consists of IP addresses and information generated by cookies, and other details about a visit to our Site, such as the time of the visit and the type of Web browser used.

                    <strong>3.	SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
                    <ol class="mc-olist alpha" type="a">
                    <li>At Your Instruction. One purpose of the Site is for our users to share information with others. We allow you to choose the information you provide to other users of the Site. Please note that once you share information, copies of that information may remain viewable in cached or archived pages, or it may be saved locally by others, even if you subsequently delete that information or change the privacy setting. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Completion of Business Transactions. If you order a product from the Site, we may share your name, address, and email address with the vendor of that product, so that the vendor can deliver the product to you. If you pay for the product with a credit card or through your bank account, we may share Your Information with third party service providers in order to complete your purchase, but we will only share Your Information with these third parties as much as is necessary to do so.  
                    </li>
                    <li>Third Party Offers. We may allow other companies to offer you products and services, including offers through our Site, co-branded pages hosted by the third party or via email. Whether or not you decide to participate in such an offer is up to you. If you purchase a product or service on a co-branded page, or via a third party offer on our Site, that requires you to submit financial and personal information, you are also consenting to our delivery of this information to that party. The offer will notify you if any financial or personally identifiable information will be shared. Such third party will be authorized to use this information in keeping with our contractual relationship with them and in accordance with their own privacy policy and information practices. We do not control these third parties and you agree that we are not liable for their acts, or any failure to act on their part.
                    </li>
                    <li>Third Party Advertising. We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our membership and to establish advertising and other business relationships with third parties.

                    <li>Third Party Ad Servers. We may allow third party ad servers or ad networks to display advertisements on the Site. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as JavaScript and web beacons. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, and we have no control over these parties' privacy policies or information collection practices (if any).
                    </li>
                    <li>Service Providers. We may sometimes use a third party to provide specific services on our behalf, including sending e-mails to our members, conducting member surveys, processing transactions or performing statistical analysis of our services. In these cases, we may provide certain personal information, such as your name and e-mail address and other financial information necessary for the service to be provided. However, these third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information and are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using this information for any other purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Internet Service Providers.

                    </li>

Members will be notified of any such business transition via e-mail or prominent notice on the Site.
                    </li>
                    <li>Legal Disclosure. We may disclose Your Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable law, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on us or the Site, protect and defend our rights or property, or investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use.
                    </li>
                    </ol>

                    <strong>7.	IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CHILDREN</strong><br>
                    While we take seriously the privacy of all our visitors, we are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children under the age of 16 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age. We have installed screening mechanisms to identify the age of all visitors to any area of the Site that requires the collection of personally identifiable information. A Site visitor indicating they are under 16 years old that attempts to submit personally identifiable information will receive an error message stating that he or she must be 16 years of age or older to be a Site member. We believe our policy is in the best interests of children. We hope you understand our position concerning children’s privacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Any personal information that is unknowingly collected from a child under the age of 16 years old will be deleted upon written request from the child’s parent or legal guardian.  Deletion requests should be sent to info@mixcrate.com.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>8.	CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
                    We may update this policy from time to time as our information practices are modified or changed. Material changes will take effect within 30 days of posting on the Site; all other changes are effective immediately upon posting. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through notice on our home page. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
                    </p>
