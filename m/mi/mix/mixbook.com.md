## WedPics Website and Mobile Application (“WedPics”)

Name and Profile Picture. Our mobile application WedPics and its associated website are designed to make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For this reason, your name and profile picture do not have privacy settings. If you are uncomfortable with sharing your profile picture, you should delete it (or not add one).

Contact Information. Your contact information settings control who can contact you on WedPics, and who can see your contact information such as your media. Remember that none of this information is required except for your email address, and you do not have to share your email address with anyone.

User Content. When uploading a photo, you can control exactly who can see it by selecting the event in which it will be stored. The specified event will determine who will be able to see your media.

Other. Here are some other things to remember:

  * Some of the content you share and the actions you take will be displayed on WedPics and be visible to your contacts or other WedPics users and third-party partners.
  * Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.
  * You understand that information might be reshared or copied by other users and displayed by third-party partners of the Website.
  * If you use an external source to publish information to WedPics (such as a mobile application or another website), you should check the privacy setting for that post, as it is set by that external source.



## Mixbook Affiliates

Mixbook may share your information with and receive information from affiliates of Mixbook for marketing purposes, and such use and disclosure is subject to this Privacy Policy.

## Service Providers

We provide collected information to Service providers to perform services on our behalf, such as to host the Service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Mixbook or the Service, to process payments for products or Services, to print the projects that you order, or to provide search results, personalized advertising or links. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our Service providers may have access to your Personal Information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any Personal Information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to Mixbook-specified purposes. If we provide any of the information collected from you with a third party, their use of that information will be governed by their privacy policy.

For example: when you place an order for a printed copy of a project through the Service, your billing information is transmitted to a third-party credit card processor and your shipping information is transmitted to a third-party printer to be printed, bound, and shipped to you. In addition, if you elect to permit your credit card or other billing information to be saved, that information will be transmitted to a third-party credit card processor and stored by such third-party credit card processor for the purpose of completing purchases you make in connection with the Service.

## Marketing

We share data with third parties in connection with advertising, retargeting and analytics on behalf of Mixbook. Under no circumstances do we rent, trade or share your address or e-mail address with any other company for their marketing purposes without your consent.

## Legally Required

We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas, law enforcement investigations, or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We also may release information to protect our rights, property, or other interests, including those of our customers or other third parties or to prevent illegal activities or violations of the Mixbook Terms of Service. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents, or government agencies.

## Business Transfers

If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Mixbook business, or individual business units owned by Interactive Memories, Inc., were to change, information may be transferred to the new owner so the Service can continue operations. We may also transfer information if we partner with, acquire or merge with another company. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data as set out in this privacy policy.

## Links

The Service may contain links to web sites not operated or controlled by Mixbook. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Service to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected via the Service.

Mixbook is headquartered in the United States. We have operations and service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions (including the United States) that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. By providing your Personal Information to the Service, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.

Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. If the provider is not EU-US Privacy Shield certified, we may use the EU Model Clauses. We are applying for certification with the U.S. Department of Commerce under the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

Some of our external third-party providers are based outside of the EEA, so their processing of data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they stop being customers for tax purposes.

We also make a promise to you that you can come back at any time in the future and re-order products you have ordered from us in the past or utilize photos and other content you have uploaded to the service to create and order additional products. So, unless you actively delete this information, we keep it, so we can keep our promise to you. 

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data; see Your Rights and Choices below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Mixbook is not intended to be used by children, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 (16 in the EU). The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) defines personal information as "individually identifiable information," including things like a first and last name, a street address, an email address, or a telephone number. COPPA places requirements on websites that collect such information from children.

You must be at least 13 years or older (16 in the EU) to register and use the Service. If you are under the age of 13 (16 in the EU), you must use an account created by a parent or guardian, and you must have the explicit permission of a parent or guardian to use the Service.

In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 (16 in the EU), we will take appropriate steps to delete that information. If you become aware or believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us as provided in the Contact Us section.

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 (16 in the EU) ask their parents before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the internet.

Mixbook takes precautions to protect our users’ Personal Information: your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall, and we utilize other physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the information we have collected and to prevent the unauthorized access to or disclosure of your information.

However, no precautions are 100% effective. As a result, Mixbook does not guarantee that Personal Information you provide to us will remain secure. In the event we become aware that the security of the sites has been compromised or users' personal information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with data protection and law enforcement authorities.

Email and instant messaging including chat are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging Services. If you have any questions about the security of the Mixbook Web Site, please contact us at privacy@mixbook.com.

## Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information  
(European Economic Area)

If you are from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We collect and use your information for a variety of business purposes that are in our legitimate interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, or to comply with our legal obligations.

If you wish to learn more about specific legal grounds we rely on to process your information for any particular purpose (including any legitimate interests we have to process this information), please contact us as provided under the Contact Us section. For example, we rely on our legitimate interests to process information for direct marketing purposes and for fraud prevention and detection, provided these interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

## Your Data Protection Right  
(European Economic Area)

In some regions, such as the EEA, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal information, including the right to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information. We takes reasonable steps to ensure that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and up to date. You also can manage your profile and settings within your account settings. However, if you are not a user of our Services and you want to contact us directly about accessing, correcting, updating, or deleting your personal information, or altering your data or marketing preferences, you can do so at any time by contacting as provided in the Your Rights and Choices section. We will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.

You can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us as provided in the Your Rights and Choices section.

You can complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA and Switzerland are available here.

Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We may ask you to verify your identity in order to help us respond efficiently to your request.

We will post any updates and/or changes to our Privacy Policy by posting any changes on the Site with all changes taking effect immediately upon their posting on the Site. If we make changes, we will indicate at the top of the page the policy effective date. If we materially change the treatment of your personal data, we will work to provide you reasonable notice of such changes through our Service, by email or other communication.

We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Your use of the Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
