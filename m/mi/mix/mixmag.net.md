# Mixmag Cookie Policy - Mixmag

We use a number of different cookies on our site. If you do not know what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we recommend you visit [About Cookies](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) for detailed guidance. The list below describe the cookies we use on this site and what we use them for. Currently we operate an 'implied consent' policy which means that we assume you are happy with this usage. If you are not happy, then you should either not use this site, or you should delete the cookies having visited the site, or you should browse the site using your browser's anonymous usage setting (called "Incognito" in Chrome, "InPrivate" for Internet Explorer, "Private Browsing" in Firefox and Safari etc.)

 **FIRST PARTY COOKIES**  
These are cookies that are set by this website directly.

Google Analytics and Quantcast: We use Google Analytics and Quantcast to collect information about visitor behaviour on our website. They store information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. This Analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site and is not tied to personally identifiable information. We therefore do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. You can find out more about Google's position on privacy as regards its analytics service [here](http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/privacyoverview.html) and [Quantcast](http://www.quantcast.com/how-we-do-it/consumer-choice/).

Drupal: Our websites runs the popular Drupal Content Management System and cookies are used to store basic data on your interactions with Drupal, and whether you have logged into Drupal. We use a session cookie to remember your log-in for you if you are a registered user and we deem these as being strictly necessary to the working of the website. If these are disabled then various functionality on the site will be broken. More information on session cookies and what they are used for can be found [here](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/session-cookies-used-for.html).

 **THIRD PARTY COOKIES  
** Most of the advertisements you see on the website are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own cookies (or web beacons) to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once. These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of the website).

You can visit the trade body representing advertising companies for more information on how to opt out of these cookies [here](http://youronlinechoices.com/).
