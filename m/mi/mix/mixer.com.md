# Myxer - Privacy Policy

Myxer understands the importance of privacy and is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how Myxer collects and uses your personal information. 

## WHY DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Myxer collects personal information to improve the manner by which we operate and offer our products and services. We use the personal information to communicate with you about those products and services, and provide effective, timely customer support when needed. We will never rent or sell any of the personal information we collect from you to anyone, and will not share your personal information with anyone without your consent except as described in this Privacy Policy. 

## WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

The information we gather is different based upon the services that you use. 

  * The information may include your mobile phone number, name, email address, and information such as your birth year and zip code.
  * If you decide to purchase content from us, we may also ask for your billing information including your billing address.
  * We automatically receive information on our server logs from your browser, including your computer configuration (such as operating system, connection speed, and peripherals); mobile phone device information and network carrier information and the Internet IP address and URL of the website that sent you to the Myxer registration page.
  * We also collect other optional profile data including but not limited to a display image.
  * We collect the types of peripherals used by Myxer products on your computer.
  * We collect demographic information provided by you (such as language, gender and age, and, if applicable, content preferences and personalization information).
  * We collect your musical usage patterns and types of music you listen to and whether you logged into or out of a Myxer service, or changed your password or billing information.



We will not sell, rent or otherwise distribute your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as set forth below. 

## HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp).

Google is one of the third-pary advertising companies used to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visits to this site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

## HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Myxer uses your mobile phone number and mobile phone device information to deliver to you mobile phone content such as ringtones, full-track music downloads, pictures, and videos.

Myxer uses your other personal information to deliver to you and bill you for Myxer products and services, and communicate with you concerning your account and customer service issues. This may include: 

  * verifying authorization of credit card usage before any purchase of premium content or services; 
  * updating you on important changes to your account such as the receipt of payments and thanks for inviting your friends.
  * determining if you meet the minimum system requirements to use our products, and providing information concerning compatibility and interoperability to you;
  * asking you to participate in surveys about products, services, news and events; 
  * offering you product upgrades, content and services for you to purchase; 
  * providing you with content, services, instructions, and a more personalized experience based on personal information, such as zip/postal code and any content or other preferences you provide; 
  * in the case of the Myxer Desktop Agent or any other downloaded Myxer software, auto-updating that downloaded Myxer software; 
  * providing you with news, free newsletters, updates, targeted advertising, promotions, and special offers that give you a better understanding of how our products are used. 



The information that makes up your "public profile" including the display name you choose to associate with your account, and an optional image you may have chosen to use to represent you, are public information that may be shared with others. In addition, information about what band "fanlists" you have joined, and what content you have recently contributed to or downloaded from Myxer are public by default. You may choose to hide this last bit of information by choosing the appropriate selections from the account preferences pages. 

## HOW DO WE HANDLE CHILDREN’S PRIVACY CONCERNS?

Myxer does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on any Myxer website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our websites is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Myxer websites or services at any time or in any manner. If Myxer learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Myxer websites without verified parental consent, then Myxer will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. 

## WHEN AND HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?

Myxer does not sell, rent, or share your personal information to anyone unless you consent to provide such information. Myxer may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for Myxer, and to better serve our customers. Myxer's contractors are bound by strict contractual requirements to keep all personal information they process strictly confidential and to use such information solely on behalf of Myxer. Also, Myxer may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

(a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Myxer;  
(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Myxer and its products; or   
(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Myxer products or the public at large.

The Myxer websites and products may contain links to other websites and products. Myxer is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or products. Please visit the privacy policies of these sites in order to understand their privacy policies and data collection practices. 

## CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We frequently revise this Privacy Policy to keep it up to date with Myxer products, services and web pages. 

## NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE

We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. Myxer does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. Myxer shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States. 

If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our products or services or would like to make a complaint, please contact: [support@myxer.com](mailto:support@myxer.com)
