We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

#### Technical and regulatory information

##### Logging practices

MIPI Alliance automatically records the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of visitors. The IP address is a unique number assigned to every computer on the internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, the IP address that we collect may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because, with some broadband connections, your IP address doesn’t change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer.

As well as recording the IP addresses of users, MIPI Alliance may also keep track of sites that users visited immediately prior to visiting MIPI Alliance’s website and the search terms they used to find it. We keep track of the pages visited on MIPI Alliance’s website, the amount of time spent on those pages and the types of searches done on them. Your searches remain confidential and anonymous. MIPI Alliance uses this information only for statistical purposes to find out which pages users find most useful and to improve the website.

MIPI Alliance also captures and stores information that you transmit. This may include:

  * Browser/device type/version
  * Operating system used
  * Media access control (MAC) address
  * Date and time of the server request
  * Volume of data transferred



##### External links behavior

Some of MIPI Alliance’s websites link to other sites created and maintained by other public- and/or private sector organizations. MIPI Alliance provides these links solely for your information and convenience.

When you transfer to an outside website, you are leaving the MIPI Alliance domain, and MIPI Alliance’s information management policies no longer apply. MIPI Alliance encourages you to read the privacy statement of each external website that you visit before you provide any personal data.

##### Cookies and web beacons

Cookies and web beacons are electronic placeholders that are placed on your device by websites to track your individual movements on that website over time. MIPI Alliance uses both session-based cookies (which last only for the duration of the user’s session) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device and provides information about the session you are in and waits for the next time you use that site again).

These cookies and web beacons provide useful information to MIPI Alliance, enabling us to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user’s access to and use of our sites, allows us to track usage behavior, and to balance the usage of our websites on all MIPI Alliance web servers.

Tracking cookies, third-party cookies, and other technologies such as web beacons may be used to process additional information, enable non-core functionalities on the MIPI Alliance website and enable third-party functions (such as a social media “share” link). We may also include web beacons and other similar technology in promotional email messages to determine whether the messages have been opened.

##### Do Not Track (DNT)

The online advertising industry has self-regulatory initiatives designed to provide consumers a choice in the types of ads they may see online and to conveniently opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all of the companies participating in these programs. Our websites do not respond to DNT consumer browser settings.

##### Collaboration with authorities

MIPI Alliance has appointed its Managing Director to serve as its data protection officer to represent regulatory authorities inside the MIPI Alliance organization, and in return represent the MIPI Alliance organization to regulatory authorities.

The MIPI Alliance data protection officer will ensure proper communication with the relevant regulatory authority for privacy. The data protection officer will also lead investigative action, complaint handling and data breach notification. The data protection officer will also monitor regulatory changes and consult the regulatory authority where implementation of a regulatory or technological change leads to doubt.

##### Responses to legal requests

MIPI Alliance reserves the right to share your information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law.

In the event of bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.

##### Your European Union privacy rights

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation EU 2016/679) (also known as GDPR), if you are an individual protected by the GDPR you may have certain rights as a data subject. To request information about or avail yourself of those rights, please send an email to [admin@team.mipi.org](mailto:admin@team.mipi.org) with "GDPR Request" in the subject line. In the email please describe, with specificity, the GDPR right you are requesting assistance with. Please note additional information may be requested prior to initiation of a request and that MIPI Alliance reserves the right to charge a fee with respect to certain requests. Upon MIPI Alliance’s completion of its review you will be notified if your request has been granted, denied, or exemptions apply.
