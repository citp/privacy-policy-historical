  * **Third-party Analytics Tools.** We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, Crashlytics, and others that use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends. These services may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.

We may share the information we collect from or about you with:

  * Our affiliates;



  * Our service providers performing services on our behalf (e.g., Site hosting providers and other parties who assist us in operating our Site, conducting our business, or serving our customers); 



  * Business partners, such as developers who provide Houndify-Enabled Products. If you are using a Houndify-Enabled Product, we may share certain usage and limited voice and audio information with the developer of that application to help them provide or improve their product; 



  * Third parties, such as law enforcement entities or parties involved in a corporate transaction if (i) we are required to do so by law or in response to legal process, (ii) to enforce our site policies, or (iii) protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety or (iv) in the event we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy or liquidation where the business will not continue as a going concern, receivership, sale of assets, or transition of our Services to another provider, then any information we collect may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract;



  * Third parties, such as our vendors, suppliers, advertisers, and analytics companies to improve our Services and the relevance of the content provided by those third parties. This information is shared in aggregate form, except for certain interactions you make with advertising content (for example, when you click on an ad to upgrade an App). 




We do not share information about our own cookies with third parties; third parties can access cookie information only from their own cookies. We utilize third-party analytics, including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, to understand our users better so that we can improve our Services to you. We may also share anonymous demographic and age data with our advertising partners;

  * Third parties, with whom you can share data through the functionality provided by the Services for sharing or exporting your search results.




**Cross Border Data Transfers**

We may transfer information from or about you or your devices to countries other than the country where you are located (including the United States), which may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. By providing us with your information, you agree to such transfers.

**Individuals Located in the EEA or Switzerland**

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we will comply with applicable legal requirements for the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland. In particular, SoundHound has filed its certification of adherence to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce and the European Commission, and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, respectively, with respect to the processing of certain personal information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland to SoundHound. Our Privacy Shield Policy is available [here](https://web.archive.org/en/privacy-shield). SoundHound's Privacy Shield certification is currently pending with the Department of Commerce; this statement will be updated once that certification is complete.

As explained in this Privacy Policy, we sometimes provide your information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party's access, use, and disclosure of the personal data must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We may be required to disclose personal information that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In addition, we enter into Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission with our business partners where appropriate. 

We may also rely on various legal grounds to collect, use, and otherwise process your information, including when:

  * You have consented to the processing of your information;

  * We need your information to provide you with services and products requested by you, or to respond to your inquiries; 

  * We have a legal obligation to process your information;

  * We or a third party have a legitimate interest in using your information. In particular, we have a legitimate interest in using your information to ensure and improve the security and performance of our Service, to anonymize your information, to carry out data analyses, and to protect us or our business partners against fraud.




**Your Rights and Choices**

You may limit some of the information we collect as follows:

  * **Location Information.**  You may stop our collection of location information in one of our Apps by managing your App settings or turning off location services for your device, if your device allows you to do so. Please refer to your device’s settings or user manual for instructions on how to turn off location services.

  * **Contacts.** You may enable or disable the sharing of contacts information to improve voice recognition in Hound via the “Contacts” switch in the settings page.

  * **Personalized Advertising.**  You may opt-out of the processing by advertising service providers who may collect certain information from you when you use our Services and may use that or other information to serve you with advertisements that may be of greater interest to you. Some of these service providers are members of the [ _Network Advertising Initiative_](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/)  or the [ _Digital Advertising Alliance_](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/). If you do not wish to receive personalized ads in our Services, please visit the opt-out pages for those organizations to learn about how you may opt out of receiving personalized ads from member companies.

  * **Advertising Identifiers.**  You may opt out of our use of your mobile device’s advertising identifier to serve personalized advertising in our Apps by enabling the global interest-based advertising opt-out option appropriate to your device. Please note that opting out via this setting will not affect our use or sharing of any information we have already collected. For more information regarding these advertising identifiers and their options, please visit [ _https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3405269  _](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3405269)for Android devices or [ _https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074  _](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074)for iOS devices.

  * **Marketing Communications.**  Any marketing emails we send you will contain instructions for how to unsubscribe from receiving future marketing communications. Please note, however, that you may still receive administrative announcements, such as service disruptions, via email even if you unsubscribe from marketing communications.

  * **Do Not Track.** Some browsers provide you with a way to signal that you do not want your browsing activity to be tracked. The Services may not currently respond to a Do Not Track ("DNT") or similar signal, as we are awaiting consensus from the Internet policy and legal community on the meaning of DNT and the best way to respond to these signals.




If you choose not to provide us with information we collect, some features of the Services may not work as intended without access to these sorts of information. For example, navigation features in our Apps need access to your location to work properly and responses to voice queries that involve contacts’ information will not work as well without knowing the spelling of your contacts.

In some countries, and in particular if you are located in the EEA or Switzerland, you may have the right to:

  * Request access to and receive information about the information we maintain about you, to update and correct inaccuracies in your information, to restrict or to object to the processing of your information, to have the information anonymized or deleted, as appropriate, or to exercise your right to data portability to easily transfer your information to another company. In addition, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your country of residence, place of work or where an incident took place. 

  * Withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding the processing of your information, at any time and free of charge. We will apply your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal.




Those rights may be limited in some circumstances by local law requirements. You may exercise your rights by contacting us as specified below. We will respond to any complaints as soon as possible and within thirty (30) days, but we may first need to request additional information from you to confirm.

If you reside in an applicable jurisdiction and would like to exercise your rights in relation to information from or about you, you may contact us at [privacy@soundhound.com](mailto:privacy@soundhound.com) or write to us at Attn: Privacy Group, 5400 Betsy Ross Drive, Santa Clara, CA, 95054, U.S.A. 

In your request, please make clear which information your request relates to and provide your name, address, email address, and telephone number so that we can attempt to find your information and contact you regarding your request. We may also need to verify your identity before implementing your request.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping or legal compliance purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion.

**Security and Data Retention**

SoundHound maintains an information security program designed to safeguard the systems that collect, process, and store the information we collect from or about you or your devices, including against threats of compromise, theft, or destruction. Unfortunately, no information storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant against all forms of attack or compromise caused by unintentional errors, omissions, or malicious actors.

By using our Services, you expressly consent to the storage of the information we collect, including your registration information, location information, and recordings of your voice, in a form associated with your device identifiers. 

We retain information from or about you or your devices for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. When the information is no longer necessary for these purposes, we delete it or keep it in a form that does not identify you, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrolment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.

**Children 13 and Under**

Unfortunately, our Sites and Apps are not meant for children under age 13. By using the Sites or Apps, you represent that you are 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13, do not use the Sites or Apps or send any information about yourself to us. 

We do not knowingly request or collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [ _privacy@soundhound.com_](mailto:privacy@soundhound.com). We will delete such information within a reasonable period of time.

**Third Party Apps and Links to Third Party Websites**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to links you follow from the Services (including the practices of a Houndify-Enabled Product other than those expressly disclosed above) to other sites, services, applications, or online stores. For example, if you use sharing features to send a tweet or to post on a social network, the information you send will be visible to others.

To understand how other sites, services, applications, and online stores handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies.

**Changes to this Policy**

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, without prior notice. When we do, we will post the changed policy on our Sites and in the Apps, and we will revise the Effective Date listed below. At our discretion, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes, by email to any address you may have provided to us, through a pop-up window on the Sites or in the Apps, or other similar mechanism as appropriate under the circumstances. By continuing to use the Sites or Apps after we post the revised Privacy Policy to them, you signify your acceptance of the revised policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy so you know how we are collecting, using, and sharing your information.
