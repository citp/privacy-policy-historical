# MidwayUSA's Privacy Policy

MidwayUSA has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. Your privacy is very important to us.

### Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Secure communications on the web require attention to authentication, encryption and data integrity. All three are addressed by industry-standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. We use SSL to communicate with secure browsers such as AOL, Netscape and Internet Explorer. This means that your name, address, credit card numbers and any other information you provide through SSL are encrypted in a way that makes it extremely difficult for others to decode. We use technology provided by Veri-Sign to make your online visit as secure as possible. All payment information is collected in a secure environment that can be confirmed through Veri-Sign, Inc. You can tell if your computer is using SSL when you see a lock at the bottom of your screen or by checking the URL to ensure it is pointing to "https."

Our security measures do not end once you have completed your online order. For example, the moment you press "submit" to send your order, the encrypted order is sent directly to our order processing system.

### The Information We Collect

Midwayusa.com collects information on:

  * Referring URLs for new advertising avenues
  * Browser types and versions for site functionality
  * Operating Systems for site functionality
  * Domain names of email addresses (when possible) of visitors to our website
  * General information on which pages consumers visit
  * Information submitted by the consumer, including email information, survey information, requests for information and/or site registrations



We also may request personally identifiable information from you in order to handle your order, question or catalog request.

### How We Use Information

The information we collect is used to process orders and information requests, to improve the content of our website, to notify consumers about product and website updates or problems with requests or orders.

We occasionally exchange our customer postal address list with other reputable companies, however, you may opt-out or otherwise prohibit such uses by checking the "Do not share my information" box on the [Your Account](https://www.midwayusa.com/Account/YourAccount?function=ShowAccount) page (don't forget to save the change) or by calling Customer Service at 1-800-243-3220.

### Cookies & How We Use Them

Our shopping cart functionality is based on "cookies" or customized pieces of information our site stores on your hard drive. Because cookies only contain text, they cannot transmit a virus or damage your system. They cannot gather information about you or your computer. The sole purpose of storing cookies is to remember information about your MidwayUSA account and make online shopping easier. If you prefer not to accept cookies, it may be necessary to call 1-800-243-3220 to place your order.

### About Children

Midwayusa.com does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are under 18 years of age, do not submit any information without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian.

### Links to Other Sites

We provide links to many of the manufacturers of our products and other sites we think you may enjoy. These sites operate independently of MidwayUSA and have established their own privacy and security policies. Please review these policies at any site you visit.
