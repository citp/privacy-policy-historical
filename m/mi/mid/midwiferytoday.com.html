<h2 class="inlineheading">General Information</h2>
<p>When you visit our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes only the domain name of your Internet service provider, and not your e-mail address. However, we do collect your e-mail address if you communicate with us via e-mail.</p>
<p>We also collect aggregate information on what pages people access or visit. This means we know how many people visited a specific page, but not who they are.</p>
<p>We may also collect information that you voluntarily give us through online surveys, advertiser entries in the Birth Market, on-site registrations, or other forms.</p>
<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content and organization of our Web site, and for internal review. We may also use this information to contact you for various purposes.</p>

<h2 class="inlineheading">Our Use of E-mail Addresses</h2>
<p>If you subscribe to <cite class="mtpub">Midwifery Today E-News</cite> or to other Midwifery Today e-mail publications and/or e-mail discussion lists, your e-mail address will be used only for that purpose, or to contact you personally in case a problem arises. Your e-mail address will not be sold, rented or otherwise given out to third parties.</p>
<p>Occasionally, subscribers to Midwifery Today e-mail newsletters may receive special editions with information about a birth-related product or service that Midwifery Today believes would be of interest to you.</p>

<h2 class="inlineheading">Our Use of Other Contact Information</h2>

If you give us your postal address online or by e-mail, phone, fax or postal mail, this information will be entered into the Midwifery Today customer database.

If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by contacting us by e-mail, phone or letter, using the contact information provided above.</p>
<p>Your postal mailing address may be rented to companies that Midwifery Today believes offer a product or service of interest to you. If you do not want your postal address sold to third parties, please let us know at the time you place your order. Otherwise, you may request to have your name put on our do-not-share list by contacting us by e-mail, phone or letter. We will remove your name from the list we share with other organizations.</p>
<p><b>Phone Number</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
We may use your phone number to contact you about orders you have placed. We also may phone you to let you know about a new product or service we are offering, to let you know about special offers, or to remind you that it's time to renew. If you do not wish to receive such phone calls, please let us know by contacting us by e-mail, phone or letter.  Please provide us with your name and phone number.
