Why?                   Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                       consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell
                       you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice
                       carefully to understand what we do.
What?                  The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product(s) or
