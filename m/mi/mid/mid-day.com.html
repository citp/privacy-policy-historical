    <p>Mid-Day is committed to protecting your privacy and developing  technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience.  This Statement of Privacy applies to the Mid-Day Web site and governs  data collection and usage. By using the Mid-Day website, you consent to  the data practices described in this statement.</p>
    <p><strong>Collection of your Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>Mid-Day  collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail  address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Mid-Day also  collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you,  such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and  favorites.</p>
    <p>There is also information about your computer hardware  and software that is automatically collected by Mid-Day. This  information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names,  access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used  by Mid-Day for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the  service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Mid-Day  Web site.</p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose  personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data  through Mid-Day public message boards, this information may be  collected and used by others. Note: Mid-Day does not read any of your  private online communications.</p>
    <p>Mid-Day encourages you to review  the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Mid-Day  so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share  your information. Mid-Day is not responsible for the privacy statements  or other content on Web sites outside of the Mid-Day and Mid-Day family  of Web sites.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of your Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>Mid-Day  collects and uses your personal information to operate the Mid-Day Web  site and deliver the services you have requested. Mid-Day also uses  your personally identifiable information to inform you of other  products or services available from Mid-Day and its affiliates. Mid-Day  may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion  of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
    <p>Mid-Day  does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.  Mid-Day may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external  business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest  to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information  (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the  third party. In addition, Mid-Day may share data with trusted partners  to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail,  provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third  parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to  provide these services to Mid-Day, and they are required to maintain  the confidentiality of your information.</p>
    <p>Mid-Day does not use or  disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or  political affiliations, without your explicit consent.</p>
    <p>Mid-Day  keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within  Mid-Day, in order to determine what Mid-Day services are the most  popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and  advertising within Mid-Day to customers whose behavior indicates that  they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
    <p>Mid-Day Web  sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if  required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action  is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with  legal process served on Mid-Day or the site; (b) protect and defend the  rights or property of Mid-Day; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances  to protect the personal safety of users of Mid-Day, or the public.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>The  Mid-Day Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online  experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by  a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver  viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can  only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to  you.</p>
    <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a  convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to  tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For  example, if you personalize Mid-Day pages, or register with Mid-Day  site or services, a cookie helps Mid-Day to recall your specific  information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of  recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,  shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Mid-Day Web  site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you  can easily use the Mid-Day features that you customized.</p>
    <p>You have  the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser  setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline  cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive  features of the Mid-Day services or Web sites you visit.</p>
    <p><strong>Security of your Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>Mid-Day  secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or  disclosure. Mid-Day secures the personally identifiable information you  provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment,  protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal  information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web  sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
    <p><strong>Changes to this Statement</strong></p>
    <p>Mid-Day  will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company  and customer feedback. Mid-Day encourages you to periodically review  this Statement to be informed of how Mid-Day is protecting your  information.</p>
    <p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>
    <p>Mid-Day  welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you  believe that Mid-Day has not adhered to this Statement, please contact  Mid-Day at <a href="mailto:cs@mid-day.com">cs@mid-day.com</a>. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.</p>
