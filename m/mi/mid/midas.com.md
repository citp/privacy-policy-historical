** Midas Canada Inc. (the “Company”) is in the business of granting franchises for the operation of Midas Shops for the retail sale and installation of exhaust, brake and suspension systems services, wheel alignment, oil and lubrication, battery and tire installation, starting and charging, heating and air conditioning, and general and scheduled maintenance (filters, belts wiper blades, hoses). Currently, there are no company-owned Midas Shops operating in Canada. The Company is committed to ensuring the privacy of those who use its products and services and those who visit its website. This Privacy Policy describes how the Company is committed to safeguarding your personal information.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what personal information we collect about you, how we use it, whether we disclose it to anybody else, how long we keep it, and how you can request access to your personal information or obtain more information about the Company’s privacy policies and procedures.

 **What Personal Information Does the Company Collect and Why?  
** The Company, through its network of franchised Midas Shops, collects personal information of its customers in the normal course of doing business. “Personal information” is any information that could be used to identify you and, depending on the nature of your interaction with us, may include the following (“Personal Information”):

  * Name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers; 
  * E-mail address; 
  * Year, make, model, mileage, VIN and License Plate Number of your vehicle(s); and 
  * Parts and services provided to you at the Midas Shops and related dates of service. 



Providing your Personal Information, either in person, by telephone, or on-line, constitutes your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such Personal Information by the Company for the purpose of providing the relevant services. We only collect information by lawful means and do not collect any information in a manner that is unreasonably intrusive. (For more information on our Website Privacy Policy, please visit [www.midas.com](http://www.midas.com/).)

If you choose to withhold Personal Information, you may not be able to avail yourself to certain services or programs offered by the Company or the Midas Shops.

The Company may use your Personal Information to provide you with products, services and information. For example, the Company may:

  * Provide you with reminders that your vehicle requires servicing; 
  * Administer and maintain the Midas warranty program and provide you with warranty coverage thereunder; 
  * Provide you with information and updates regarding products and services that the Midas Shops have to offer and which the Company and the Midas Shops think will interest you, including marketing and promotional information;

  * Improve the Company’s and the Midas Shops’ services and products to better understand and meet your automotive needs. 



**Does the Company Disclose Personal Information?  
** The Company does not sell your Personal Information to third parties. However, the Company may, on occasion, share some or all of your Personal Information with third parties for the purposes set out above. For example, Personal information may be shared:

  * With other Midas Dealers or entities affiliated with the Company for the purposes of fulfilling warranty obligations and to administer marketing promotions; and 
  * With third parties that provide the Company with services, such as processing and marketing. 



These third parties may be located in the United States. Therefore, your information may be processed and stored in the United States and, as a result, the United States government, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the United States.

Additionally, the Company may disclose your Personal Information where and when required or permitted by law to do so. Please note that your Personal Information will, upon any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, be transferred to a purchaser agreeing to use your Personal Information for the same purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

** The Company has implemented appropriate safeguards and security measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. Security measures adopted by the Company include limiting the number of individuals with access to your Personal Information. All affiliates, suppliers, agents, employees and other parties performing services on our behalf who handle Personal Information are bound to maintain the confidentiality of all Personal Information and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose.

 **Accuracy and Access  
** We are committed to ensuring that the Personal Information we hold for each customer is accurate, up-to-date and complete. You have the right to access your Personal Information in our files and to update or remove that information as necessary, subject to any legal restrictions that would prohibit such action. To access your Personal Information, please contact our Privacy Officer by telephone, e-mail or post at the numbers and address provided below. Please be sure to specify what information requires updating or removal. Corrections will be made at no cost to Midas customers. For other requests, a small fee may be charged to cover the associated costs. We will endeavor to keep these fees as reasonable as possible and will alert you to the charge and amount prior to executing your request. In these instances, you will be given the opportunity to withdraw your request.

 **Changes to this Privacy Policy
