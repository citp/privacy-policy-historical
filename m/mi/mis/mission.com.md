# Privacy Policy — Mission Athletecare

**Privacy Policy**

At Mission Product Holdings, Inc. ("MISSION"), we know how our customers and visitors like you value your privacy, and we have created this privacy policy to ensure that you understand our policies and procedures, what personal information you must provide if you wish to use this website (the "Site") and, ultimately, just how we use such personal information.

**Information Collected By MISSION**

MISSION collects two types of information from users of the Site: personal information described below; and non-personal information such as information about traffic patterns on MISSION (for example, how many users log on to MISSION on a daily basis).

**Personal Information**

Some personal data, including, for example, name, age, postal address, email address, and credit card information are collected during your registration process and/or when you use this Site. For example, when you order a product or service through the Site, we may ask you for your name, address and email address or other personal information or credit card information in order to process your request.

There may be other occasions when we ask for your personal information. For instance, when you enter or respond to a contest, survey, sweepstakes or other promotional feature, we may ask you for your name, address and email address or other personal information.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

MISSION uses the information collected, including personal information, for a variety of purposes. For example, we use your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better products and services. We may use your information to communicate back to you, to update you on products, services and benefits, to personalize the Site for you, to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information, newsletters, or other information we think would be of particular interest. We will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such materials.

We may also share your personal information with our affiliates, technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our site available, enhance its functionality or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in processing your orders and/or delivering content, samples, products, services and gifts and prizes. Please note that we reserve the right to transfer your personal information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers of Site assets.

In addition, MISSION may share your personal information with certain third parties with whom we do business (including, for example, our suppliers), so that such third parties can contact you regarding products, services, offers, or other information we think you will find valuable. These third parties may also use the information to generate reports, databases and market research or for other purposes. If you would rather not have us share this information with such third parties, just notify us at cs@missionproduct.com. Make sure you notify us for each account or e-mail address you have left with us.

Information obtained through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.

**Discussions and Community Tools**

MISSION may, from time to time, make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups and other community tools available to our users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for MISSION to use. Please be considerate and respectful of others while using the community to share your opinion.

You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just MISSION - may use publicly posted information.

**Non-Personal Data**

In some cases, we may collect non-personal information. Examples of this type of information include the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system application software, and peripherals you are using and the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our Site, and your usage patterns on this site. We use your non-personal information on an aggregated basis to do such things as operate our site, enhance our site and sell and deliver advertising. We may freely share non-personal information with third parties for advertising, promotional and other purposes.

**Cookies**

We reserve the right to utilize cookie technology. A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain various types of information, including a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. We may use cookies to enhance your experience on this Site, to determine user traffic patterns and for other purposes.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent or you can flush your browser of cookies from time to time. (Note: you may need to consult the help area of your browser application for instructions.) If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, however, you may not be able to access or properly use parts of the Site.

At times, some of the advertisers on our Site and other parties we authorize (and their respective service providers) set cookies when you click their advertising banners or take other actions on the Site. While we use cookies in other parts of the Site (as discussed above), information from cookies set by advertisers and other third parties is collected by those parties and their service providers, and we may not have access to that information. The applicable company's privacy policy and/or that of its service provider will govern the use of this information and MISSION is not responsible for the privacy practices of such companies.

**Clickstream**

As you use the internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of aggregate information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Site and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not intentionally contain any personal information.

**Opt Out Procedures**

You have the option to opt out of receiving information from MISSION. This opt out messaging will generally appear at the bottom of every email that is sent out. MISSION also gives you the option to remove your information from its active database, subject to any applicable laws requiring retention. If you no longer wish to take advantage of this Site or to receive any form of direct contact from MISSION, whether it is email, discounts, newsletters, or other promotional offers or materials, or wish us to delete your personal information from our data records, contact us at cs@missionproduct.com or call us at 212-4481300 to cancel your account. MISSION is not responsible for removing information from third-party lists or databases of any kind.

Please note that we reserve the right to keep any personal or non-personal information submitted or collected until you delete or modify it or until we choose, for business reasons such as obsolescence, to delete it.

**Reviewing or changing your information**

In order to ensure that the information we maintain is accurate, MISSION gives users the option to change or modify their information previously provided. If you would like to change your information currently in our database, please contact us at cs@missionproduct.com. MISSION is not responsible for updating information contained in third-party lists or databases.

**Security**

We work to protect the security of your information. All information is stored on our (or our hosting vendor's) servers in a secure location. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. If your password is compromised, notify us at once at cs@missionproduct.com.

**Protection for Children**

This Site is not intended for users under the age of 18. Furthermore, we have no intention of collecting personally identifiable information from children (i.e., individuals under the age of 13). Where appropriate, we take reasonable measures to inform children not to submit such information to our site or in response to advertisements. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, that child's parent or guardian should contact us at cs@missionproduct.com or send us a letter marked "Privacy - Urgent" at the address below if they would like the information submitted by the child deleted from our database. We will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

**Privacy Precaution Warning**

Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit via our online services.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose personal information and non-personal information we gather as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which MISSION deems improper.

**Your Consent**

You may have certain rights under the Communications Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and other state and federal statutes that may apply, and by accepting these terms and using this Site, you are waiving all of these rights with respect to (i.e., your are consenting to) collection, use, disclosure and storage of your personally identifiable and non-personal information as described above. You recognize that we are able to offer our service to you at our rates based upon these terms which are an integral part of our contract for the provision of products and services.

By using the Site, you also authorize the export of personal information to the USA and its storage and use as specified above when you provide such information to us. Our headquarters is in the USA in New York, New York. This policy and our legal obligations are subject to the laws of New York and the USA, regardless of the location of any user. Any claims or complaints must be filed in the USA in the State of New York.

We may amend our privacy policy, but if we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

By providing your email address to MISSION, you expressly consent to receive emails from us. We may use email to communicate with you, to send information that you have requested or to send information about other products or services developed or provided by us or other parties.

Any communication or material you transmit to us by email or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions, or the like is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and nonproprietary. Except to the extent expressly covered by this policy, anything you transmit or post may be used by us for any purpose, including but not limited to, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast and posting. Furthermore, you expressly agree that we are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you send to us without compensation and for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services using such information.
