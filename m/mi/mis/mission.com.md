# Privacy Policy | Mission

Welcome to mission.com (the " **Site** ").  Mission Product Holdings, Inc. (" **Mission** ") knows that you value your privacy, and we want you to know that it is important to us too. We created this Privacy Notice (" **Privacy Notice** ") to explain the types of information collected through the Service (as defined below), how we will use, disclose and protect this information once it is collected, and how you can opt-out of some of our uses and disclosures of your information. 

BY ACCESSING THE SITE OR USING THE INFORMATION, TOOLS, FEATURES, AND FUNCTIONALITY LOCATED ON THE SITE (COLLECTIVELY WITH THE SITE, THE " **SERVICE** "), YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS PRIVACY NOTICE. 

We reserve the right to modify, alter or update this Privacy Notice at any time, without prior notice, by posting any such modified, altered or updated version of this Privacy Notice on the Site.  All such modifications, alterations and updates will become effective immediately upon posting.  We encourage you to check this page each time you visit the Site. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER ANY MODIFICATIONS, ALTERATIONS OR UPDATES ARE MADE CONSTITUTES YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SUCH CHANGES. 

## 1\. TERMS OF USE

Please review our [Terms of Use](https://www.mission.com/pages/terms-of-use), which also governs your use of the Service, to understand the terms and conditions under which Mission provides products and services to you.

## 2\. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MISSION

Whenever you access the Site, make a purchase, or otherwise interact with the Service, Personal Information, Aggregate Information, and/or Service Usage Information may be collected about you or your visit.

## A. PERSONAL INFORMATION

"Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you. We may collect Personal Information such as your name, age, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card and other payment information, and demographic information in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:

  * You will be asked to submit Personal Information when you sign up for our e-mail newsletters, register for an account with us, create account recovery credentials, make purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys, contribute reviews and other User Content (as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://www.mission.com/pages/terms-of-use)), engage with a social forum through the Service, or send a comment or question (including through the "Contact Us" feature of the Service).
  * When you make a purchase through or from the Service, we may ask you to provide Personal Information needed to process your purchase or provide the services you request. We also collect information about your purchase, such as the items you bought, the price of the items, the payment method you used and if the product was on sale.  In addition, we may ask you to complete a customer satisfaction survey.  If you choose to do so, you may have the ability to provide (at your option) Personal Information in addition to your comments.
  * If you call us for information about products or your purchase, we may ask you to provide Personal Information so that we can properly respond to your requests and/or process your transactions. 



## B. AGGREGATE INFORMATION

Aggregate Information is information about groups of users or our users as a whole that does not specifically identify any single user, such as, without limitation, age, gender, types of products purchased, frequency of Service visits, Service pages accessed most frequently, search terms entered on the Service, types of Submissions (as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://www.mission.com/pages/terms-of-use)), and the frequency of Submissions.  As an example, the number of people who shopped on the Service during a specific time period is Aggregate Information.  We and our third party service providers may collect Aggregate Information as permitted by applicable law.

## C. SERVICE USAGE INFORMATION<

As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," along with your IP address, can be collected and stored by a web site's server.  Clickstream data includes, for example and without limitation, which operating system and Web browser software you use to access the Service and their settings, the referring page that linked you to the Service, the pages you visit on the Service, the items you click on during your visit, your purchase information, the next website you visit when you leave the Service, any search terms you have entered on the Service or a referral site, and the type of computer or mobile device you use to access the Service (collectively with your IP address, " **Clickstream Information** ").

In addition, we and our third party service providers acting on our behalf may deploy cookies, local shared objects, tracking pixels and other tracking technologies on the Service to collect additional information about your visits (collectively with the Clickstream Information, " **Service Usage Information** ").

  * **Cookies.** We may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your computer or device from a Web server. Cookies track where you travel on our Service and what you look at and purchase. They may store your Service viewing preferences, the information in your shopping cart, your account username, and/or your logged-in status. Cookies may also enable us to relate your use of the Service over time to other information about you, including your Personal Information, and to customize the Service for you. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, inhibit or preclude your use of the Service or its features.  You may need to consult the help area of your browser application for instructions on disabling cookies.
  * **Tracking Pixels.** Certain third parties who provide services to Mission, or with which the Service integrates, may use tracking pixels. Tracking pixels may be used to help verify your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. Tracking pixels may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information. 



The Site code owned and deployed by Mission recognizes "do not track" signals, which may be adjusted in your Internet browser settings; however, certain third party services with which the Service integrates may or may not recognize "do not track" signals.

**By using the Service, you agree to the use of these tracking technologies.   **

## 10\. SECURITY

We have and will maintain security measures we deem reasonable and appropriate to secure your Personal Information against inadvertent or illegal loss, destruction, disclosure or access.  ALThough WE will use various technologies and tools to protect your PERSONAL INFORMATION against loss, destruction, disclosure or access, no method of securing data is foolproof or completely effective, and third parties may unlawfully access or intercept data transmissions, communications or stored data, and may unlawfully use the data.

If we believe that the security of your Personal Information may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.

If we have your e-mail address, you may be notified by e-mail. **You consent to the use of e-mail as a means of such notification.
