# Privacy Policy - MissesDressy.com

  


### Information Sharing: MissesDressy hates spam as much as you do!

Information collected from our customers and visitors will never be sold or transferred to others for any purpose. The information you enter in forms on our website will be used to complete your order, and send you occasional newsletters about our new products and promotions.

To complete your order, we'll need your name, address, and payment information. Your credit card information will never be stored on our computers. The credit card authorization process is instantaneous and your sensitive credit card information is immediately discarded in accordance with recently implemented e-commerce regulations. We ship items ourselves, so we won't share your shipping address won't be given to anyone. 

  


### Statistical Information gathering: Totally anonymous!

Knowing where our web traffic comes from helps us learn our customers' demographics and preference better, so we can deliver more relevant content and merchandise. We use website tracking tools by Google that allow us to perform statistical analysis of our visitors. The information used for this purposes is not related to what you enter in forms on our site. The types of information collected by Google Analytics are, for example, browser version and internet connection speed. We do not share statistical information gathered by Google with anyone.

  


### System Security: Military grade!

Our system uses real-time self-updating technology to thwart attacks by the most sophisticated of hackers. We've invested much effort to ensure that our systems are virtually impenetrable. Regardless, we do not store payment information on our servers. Once a credit card has been authorized or otherwise disapproved by our processor, we discard the credit card information.

The connection between your computer and our systems for the purpose of filling our forms (such as checkout- name, address, payment) is always encrypted through industrial-strength SSL algorithms. When you enter secure portions of our site, you'll see the http:// turn into http **s** :// in the URL, and depending on your browser, you may see other enhanced security markings (such as a golden lock in Firefox and IE).

  


### Our Facility: A fortress!

Our facility is off-limits to everyone except authorized employees. We have 24x7 camera surveillance, as well as central station alarm which is always armed when we're closed. Our employees are reminded regularly of proper confidentiality policies, such as paper shredding. You can rest assured that we've covered all bases.
