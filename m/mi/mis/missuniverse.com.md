Do Not Track

You can enable a 'Do Not Track' feature in your browser�s settings, if your browser supports that feature. When Do Not Track is turned on, your browser will send a Do Not Track request to the sites you visit. The Do Not Track request lets these sites know that you prefer not to have your browsing activity tracked. You can take similar steps in mobile.

To submit a Do Not Track request on mobile using an iOS device:

  * launch the Settings app on your iPhone -> Privacy -> Advertising. 
  * toggle ON the switch next to Limit Ad Tracking.
  * now that you have opted out of receiving ads targeted to your interests, based on your Apple ID on that device, you will be removed from the list of users receiving targeted ads.



To submit a Do Not Track request on mobile using an Android device

  * open Google Settings,
  * select AdsPrivacy.and toggle ON the switch next to Do Not Track to opt out of Ads Personalization. Do Not Track is now enabled on your Android device.
  * Apps are then instructed not to use your advertising ID to build profiles or show you personalized ads.



Some devices may require a different procedure, so please check your instructions.
