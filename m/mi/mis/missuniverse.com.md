# Miss Universe®: Corporate Info

**The Miss Universe Organization takes your electronic privacy seriously.  
We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with anyone unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information.**

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Miss Universe Organization privacy coordinator by email at [privacy@MISSUSA.com](mailto:privacy@MISSUSA.com)

**Kinds of Information**  
There are two kinds of information Web sites can obtain about you: 

  
Aggregate Information: Aggregate Information is anonymous data that Web sites use to diagnose problems on the sites' servers, administer the sites, and to help improve the quality of the Web pages. It may be your domain name (i.e. "XYZ.com") or your IP address. 

  
Personally Identifiable Information: Personally Identifiable Information is any information that personally identifies you. It can be your first and last name, your email address, your home address, or your telephone number. Sometimes this personal information is needed when you order products online, sign up with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or subscribe to an email newsletter. Other times, Web sites collect this information to help target advertising and marketing. 

  
We at The Miss Universe Organization collect certain Aggregate Information-such as your IP address (a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web), browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), and domain (e.g., "XYZ.com"). We do this in the background so it does not interrupt your cruising speed. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our site, and to gather broad demographic information. None of this information is connected with Personally Identifiable Information. So, when you enter our site, you are anonymous and will remain that way unless you choose otherwise. 

  
**Cookies**  
The Miss Universe Organization may uses cookies on this site to remember your zip code so that you can maintain a customized view of MISSUSA.com showing your city's The Miss Universe Organization-TV affiliate Web site. We may also use cookies when we conduct polls, surveys, and contests to limit multiple responses and registrations.

  
The Miss Universe Organization will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent by us to you in a cookie. The Miss Universe Organization does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes.

  
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers and our vendors. The Miss Universe Organization does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the Miss Universe Organization privacy policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

  
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the polls, surveys, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. 

  
**Surveys**  
Sometimes The Miss Universe Organization posts optional surveys in which we ask for Personally Identifiable Information. Here are some ways we might use that information: 

  
- To send you information about The Miss Universe Organization and this Web site  
- To give to our content partners, who may send you promotional material  
- To give to our advertisers, who may send you information about their products and services

The choice is yours - you do not have to answer surveys. If you choose to answer the survey, we will always tell you on the survey form how we will use the Personally Identifiable Information. If we are asking for optional information, we will mark it with an asterisk (*) so you know you can skip it if you want. And on that same page we will give you a way to "opt out" of being contacted by the Miss Universe Organization and any third parties. 

  
**Contests and Sweepstakes**  
From time to time The Miss Universe Organization runs contests and sweepstakes in which we ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, email address or telephone number. That's so we can let you know if you win. Sometimes we request additional Personally Identifiable Information such as your age, gender, and income level. And once in a while - though not often - we require this additional information in exchange for allowing you to enter the contest. Here are some of the ways we might use the information that we collect: 

  
- To notify you if you are a winner  
- To send you information about The Miss Universe Organization and this Web site  
- To give to content partners, who may send you promotional email  
- To give to advertisers, who may send you emails about their products and services

  
We may share Aggregate Information with our partners and advertisers. We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with any third party unless we tell you otherwise when asking for it. We will give you a way to "opt out" of being contacted by The Miss Universe Organization and any third parties.

  
If you win one of our contests or sweepstakes, we will not publish your name, hometown, or other Personally Identifiable Information on the site unless you give us your permission.

  
**Opt Out**  
We've mentioned this phrase - opt out - several times already. Here is how it works at The Miss Universe Organization: 

  
We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with anyone unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information. It's that simple.

  
If we ask you for Personally Identifiable Information, we will tell you if we intend to share it with others. We will provide you with a way to tell us that you don't want us to share the information or if you don't want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, services, and offerings from The Miss Universe Organization and/or any third parties. Let us know and we will use your name and address only to tell you if you win a contest. 

  
**The Miss Universe Organization and NBC TV Affiliates**

  
The Miss Universe Organization has a unique relationship with some of the NBC Television affiliates. If you are interested in local information, we will give you the option to choose a local affiliate or enter a zip code. We asked for this information so that your view of the site could be "branded" to your local NBC Television affiliate, or to any other NBC Television affiliate you choose. You'll see their logo at the top of your screen.   


Some of our affiliates provide their own content, such as local news stories. This content may be mixed with the content The Miss Universe Organization produces in New York. And some affiliates sell ads or run contests that will appear on their branded sites only.  


The Miss Universe Organization is not responsible for content or contest by our affiliates, nor for the use of any information that our affiliate may collect. 

  
We use reasonable efforts to require that all content on our site conforms to our privacy policy. But we do not control, and we are not responsible for, the content or privacy policies of our affiliates.

**Links To Other Sites  
**  
When you visit the Miss Universe Organization's Websites, you may be directed to other sites outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, you will leave The Miss Universe Organization's websites. This includes links to sites operated by advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Miss Universe Organization's logo as part of an agreement with the Miss Universe Organization. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. These other sites are not subject to the Miss Universe Organization privacy policy and the Miss Universe Organization is not responsible for the privacy policies for these other sites, nor for the use of any information that these sites may collect.

**The Miss Universe Organization Store  
**  
The Miss Universe Organization Store uses an online, faxable order form for users to buy The Miss Universe Organization products. Names, street addresses, and financial information are required to complete these orders, and may also be used to contact customers about their orders when necessary. However, neither the Miss Universe Organization nor the The Miss Universe Organization Store shares this information with third parties. 

**Deleting or Modifying Your Information**

If you've given us Personally Identifiable Information in the past and then have second thoughts or want to update it, here are your choices:

Email to [privacy@MISSUSA.com](mailto:privacy@MISSUSA.com).  
Regular mail to:

**Privacy Coordinator  
The Miss Universe Organization   
1370 Avenue of the Americas  
16th Floor New York, New York 10019**

Although it is not always possible to remove or modify information in the databases, we will make reasonable efforts to do so. If you've given us information for one of those third parties we mentioned above [remember, we tell you that when we ask the questions] and we've already passed it on, we cannot delete or change the information.

**Security of Private Information**  
We would like to tell you that your information is as safe with us as it is in your head, but, as hackers have proved worldwide, no computer security system is entirely foolproof. The most any Web site can do is make reasonable efforts, which is what we do at the Miss Universe Organization, to protect your information from theft, misuse and alteration.  


Any personal information you give us is kept in secure files. Access is limited to the few employees who have a need to know.
