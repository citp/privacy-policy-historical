**PR Disclosure Policy**

_The FCC requires that bloggers disclose their review policy if reviews will be written._

My blog is extremely PR friendly!  I would love to **review**  your products, services, venues, etc for promotion on my blog and my other social media outlets listed below. I’m the mother of 4 awesome kids…2 girls (ages 22 and 24) and 2 rowdy boys (ages 8 and 12) in addition to my entourage of fur-babies, my adorable Chihuahua, and Cats. I LOVE to travel and stay at fun and interesting destinations as well…Pitch me!

**POLICIES**

One of the least expensive ways to promote your product/service is by being featured a blog, social media outlets or word of mouth.  If requested, I will review your product/service and an individual blog post will be dedicated to your review and organization. The post may contain photos and/or images. In order to review a product, a 

_full-size_

 sample should be provided to me so that I may give an accurate review after use. If for some reason I feel that a positive review should not be given, you will be contacted before the posting and given the choice of publication.

**Sponsored blog post** : I would love to write a blog post regarding your company or service. This may be in your words or mine, using any specified links, keywords or images. Fees are negotiable.

**Advertising opportunities**  in the form of banners, text and guest posts are available and rates are negotiable.
