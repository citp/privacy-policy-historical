Pixel tags, also called web beacons are clear image (i.e. non-visible) files that may be placed on a website or in an e-mail, and request information from your device such as your browser type (also referred to as **“Cookies”** ).

We may permit third parties to collect user Personal Information over time or across third-party websites, and we may permit third parties to gather Personal Information passively on our websites for behavioral advertising purposes.

You can control many tracking tools, including cookies, from your browser. In particular, you may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our websites.

Additionally, some Internet browsers have a ‘do not track’ feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are currently not set up to respond to such signals.

TYPES OF COOKIES

We use session Cookies that expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) and persistent Cookies which remain on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire. How long a persistent Cookie remains on your browser depends on how long the visited website has programmed the Cookie to last or they can be stored for longer.

We use Cookies for different purposes, which can be categorized as follows:

  * **Functional Cookies:** These Cookies are required for the website to function and for you to use our services. They include, for example, Cookies that enable you to log in, use a wish list or store products in a shopping cart. They may also enable us to recognize you when you return to our site and store information about your preferences, so they allow us to customize our site according to your individual preferences (such as the language chosen by you).
  * **Analytical Cookies:** These Cookies analyze how users navigate around the website (pages visited, links used etc.) or how they use e-mails we’ve sent to them. They enable us to better understand interests of users and to improve our website and services.

**Google Analytics:** This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc.(“Google”). The information generated by the cookie is usually sent to a Google server in the USA. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website and to compile reports on website activities.
