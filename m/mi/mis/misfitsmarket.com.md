The NAI Opt–Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.

**Do Not Track**

Some browsers support a “Do Not Track” (or, DNT) feature, a privacy preference that Users can set in certain web browsers, which is intended to be a signal to websites and services that you do not wish to be tracked across different websites or online services you visit.  Our Website does not currently recognize or respond to DNT signals, so DNT settings do not change the way the Website operates.

Please note that we cannot control how third party websites or online services you visit through our Website respond to Do Not Track signals.  Check the privacy policies of those third parties for information on their privacy practices.
