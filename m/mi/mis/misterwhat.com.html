<h3>8. Rights of public content</h3>

8.1 If the client or user publishes contents or files in publicly accessible areas, he gives MISTERWHAT the right to use these contents (in whole or in part) on a global level, to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish them, if this is done only for the sole purpose of presentation, distribution and promotion of the content in question.

<br><br>

<br><br>
8.4 For current and future services to meet more precisely his requirements, the client accepts that a pseudonym may be requested and be used when he applies for services. The authenticated pseudonymous data, in accordance with the law, will not be merged with the data of the pseudonym holder.

<br><br>
<h3>11. Severability</h3>

11.1 If some provisions of these Terms, in whole or in part, are no longer valid, or will lose their legal effect later, the validity of the Terms will not be affected more than that. Instead of the inefficient regulations the legal provisions will come in force automatically. The same applies in case of any possible omissions in the terms.
