Protecting your private information is our priority. This Privacy Policy applies to the miansai.com and various web pages (“Site”) operated by Miansai, Inc. and any of Miansai’s affiliates, including but not limited to Miansai Retail LLC and Miansai LA Retail LLC (collectively referred to as “Miansai”). This Privacy Policy governs data collection and usage and describes the types of personal information we collect about our customers, how we use the information, with whom we share it and various other information. By using the Miansai Site, you consent to the Policy described below.

**Collection of your Personal Information**  
Miansai may collect personally identifiable information, such as your email address and Miansai account password. If you purchase Miansai’s products and services, Miansai will also collect your name, address, telephone number, billing and credit card information. This information is used to complete the purchase transaction. Miansai may also collect demographic information, such as your zip code, gender, and age. In addition, Miansai may collect product reviews and questions or other information you provide when you contact us. Miansai may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future.

Miansai collects other information from you passively. If you use the Miansai website, we may collect information about the browser you are using. Miansai uses tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons to collection information from you. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Miansai. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. In addition, our third party vendors and other social media platforms may also give us information about you.

Miansai encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Miansai so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Miansai is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Miansai website.

**Use of your Personal Information**  
Miansai collects and uses your personal information to operate its Site, deliver the goods and services you have requested and for other business purposes. Miansai may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Miansai and its affiliates. Miansai may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current goods and services or of potential new goods and services that may be offered.

Miansai does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Miansai may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is transferred to the third party. Miansai may share data with trusted third party vendors who perform services on Miansai’s behalf. Third party vendors may also help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, arrange for deliveries and provide a host of other services for Miansai and its customers.

Miansai may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Miansai, in order to determine what Miansai products or services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in particular content.

Miansai may also disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Miansai or the site; (b) law enforcement authorities or other government officials; (c) protect and defend the rights or property of Miansai; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Miansai, or the public. Miansai also reserves the right to transfer personal information it has about you in the event Miansai sells or transfers all or a portion of its business or assets (including in the event of reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).

**Use of Cookies**  
The Miansai Site may use third-party analytics services, such as those of Google Analytics, Adobe Omniture and Sizmek. Miansai, through these third parties may use cookies, web server logs and web beacons to analyze your use of the Site. Cookies help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Miansai pages, or register with Miansai Site or services, a cookie helps Miansai to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Miansai website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Miansai features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Miansai services or websites you visit.

**Internet-Based Advertising**  
Miansai may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. Miansai also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served. You may see certain ads on other websites because we engage third-party ad buying networks (such as Facebook and Twitter). Through such buying networks, we can target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. We can track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs, pixels and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Miansai advertisements, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in these ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

By using the Miansai website and submitting any Personal Information, you consent to the transfer of Personal Information to other countries, which may provide a different level of data security than your country of residence provides.

**Online Tracking and How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals**  
When you use the Site, both Miansai and certain third parties (such as our advertising networks, digital advertising partners and social media platforms) may collect personal information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites. Certain web browsers allow you to instruct your browser to send Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals to websites you visit, informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be tracked. At this time, the Miansai Site is not designed to respond to all types of DNT signals or similar mechanisms from browsers. Therefore, information about your online activities may continue to be tracked on the Miansai Site and used to maintain our website’s functionality and for our own analytics purposes described in this Privacy Notice even if your browser sends us a DNT signal. You do have certain options to opt-out of communications and collection of information as further detailed below.
