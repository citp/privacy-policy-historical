        visitors and users.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What this Privacy Statement Covers</strong><br>
        • This privacy statement covers ForuMedia's treatment of personally 
        identifiable information collected by ForuMedia through a website owned 
        and operated by ForuMedia.<br>
        <br>
        • This privacy statement does not apply to the practices of companies 
        that ForuMedia does not own or control, or of persons that ForuMedia does 
        not employ or manage, including any third-party content contributors bound 
        by contract and any third-party websites to which ForuMedia's websites 
        link.<br>
        <br>
