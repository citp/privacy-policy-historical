**Data Collection-IP Addresses**

Miami Dolphins Ltd. collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

When guests request pages from Miami Dolphins Ltd., our servers log their IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. By using this site, you signify your assent to the Miami Dolphins Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of Miami Dolphins Ltd. following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
