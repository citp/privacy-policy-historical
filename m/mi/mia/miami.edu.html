<p align="justify"><b>Non-Discrimination Policy</b><br>
It is the policy of the University of Miami that no person within the jurisdiction thereof shall, on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination or harassment (including all forms of sexual harassment and sexual violence) under any program or activity of the University, regardless of whether such program or activity occurs on-campus or off-campus. The University does not intend by this commitment to require compliance with this policy by governmental or external organizations that associate with but are not controlled by the University, except as required by law. The Executive Director of Equality Administration is responsible for coordinating the University’s effort to implement the nondiscrimination policy and Affirmative Action Programs for employees and students. The Director may be contacted at the following address or telephone number: Equality Administration Office, 1320 South Dixie Highway, Gables One Tower, Suite 100R, Coral Gables, FL 33146; Phone: (305) 284-3064.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>International Students</b><br>
The University of Miami is authorized under Federal law to enroll non-immigrant alien students.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Reserved Rights</b><br>The University reserves the right to change any provision or requirement, including, but not limited to fees and tuition, at any time without notice. Degrees, courses, programs, activities, and like academic or non-academic offerings of the University may also be changed from time to time without notice. The University further reserves the right to require a student to withdraw at any time under University policies, as may be promulgated from time to time. Further, admission of a student to the University of Miami for any semester does not imply that such student will be enrolled in any succeeding academic semesters. It also reserves the right to impose sanctions on any student whose conduct is unsatisfactory. Any admission on the basis of false statements or documents is void when the misconduct is discovered, and the student is not entitled to any credit for work which the student may have done at the University prior to any discipline that may be taken as a result of such misconduct. When a student is dismissed or suspended from the University for cause, there will be no refund of tuition or fees paid. If a dismissed student has paid only a part of his tuition and fees, the balance due the University will be considered a receivable and will be collected.</p>

<p align="justify">There will be no refund of tuition, fees, charges or any other payments made to the University in the event the operation of the University is suspended at any time as a result of any act of God, strike, riot, disruption, or for any other reason beyond the control of the University.</p>

<p align="justify"><b><font size="4"><a name="we_collect"></a>Information We Collect<br></font></b>When visiting our websites, some information is collected electronically or by technology. For example, when accessing the Internet, each computer is assigned a unique identifier called an IP address that identifies where information is coming from or where information should be sent. Along with your IP address, we collect information regarding which pages you visit on our site, from which page you came to our site, and the software you use to visit our site and its configuration. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. When you use any shopping cart functions that may be included on our websites, your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. None of that information is associated with you as an individual.</p>
<p align="justify">Our websites also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. A cookie is a collection of information stored on your computer that usually includes a username and the current date and time or other user specific information that helps us tailor our websites to your interests. Your web browser (Netscape, Explorer, etc) allows you to be warned when cookies are being placed on your computer or to refuse all cookies.

Contact information from these forms is used to respond to requests for information, send orders to you, or to contact you when necessary or requested. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Choice/Opt-out section below). Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for products and services you have requested. Unique identifiers (such as Social Security numbers) are collected from Web site visitors to verify your identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.</p>
