<p>I. Policy Statement Overview</p>
        <p>This document describes the Greater Miami Convention &amp; Visitors 
          Bureau (hereafter referred to as GMCVB) policy regarding personal information, 
          ongoing communication, site security and overall site usage of MiamiandBeaches.com, 
          also known as GMCVB.com, and TropicoolMiami.com. These provisions apply 
          solely to online activities and are not necessarily applicable to practices 
          GMCVB may engage in outside of MiamiandBeaches.com. Use of this website 
          signifies your acceptance of the terms and conditions of use set forth 
          in this document. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, 
          you may not access or otherwise use this website.</p>
        <p>II. Collection and Use of Personal Information</p>
        <p>Information collected on MiamiandBeaches.com is used to determine important 
          statistical data for the GMCVB, its partners and members to determine 
          the effectiveness of the content, programs and advertisements offered 
          through our website.</p>
        <p>The GMCVB, its partners and affiliates may collect personal contact 
          and demographic information that the consumer willingly provides such 
          as name, address, zip code and e-mail address with the intention of 
          using this information for purposes of statistical reporting and targeted 
          promotional campaigns. Contact information may be used to send promotional 
          materials from the GMCVB and/or its partners and affiliates. Users have 
          the option of discontinuing the remittance of these by contacting us 
          (please see Opt-In / Opt-Out, below).</p>
        <p>Registration areas on our site may require users to provide contact 
          information such as an e-mail address and demographic information such 
          as zip code. The GMCVB and/or its partners and members may use the information 
          provided to send users relevant promotional materials.</p>
        <p><br>
          III. Security of Personal Information</p>
        <p>We exercise reasonable care to protect your non-public personal information. 
          This includes storing the personal information on our servers behind 
          a secured firewall and ensuring all transmissions to other vendors use 
          secure encryption technology. Unfortunately, no data transmission over 
          the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. So while we strive 
          to protect your non-public personal information, we cannot guarantee 
          the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. 
          This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. 
          We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once 
          we receive your transmission, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural 
          safeguards to protect your personal information. </p>
        <p>Internally, we will limit access to non-public personal information 
          to those associates who need the information to provide products and 
          services to you or maintain or service those products or services. These 
          associates are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and 
          security policies. We will review our security arrangements from time 
          to time, as we deem appropriate.</p>
        <p><br>
          IV. Sharing of Non-Public Personal Information</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to, without notice to you, share non-public personal 
          information with companies that work for us for the sole purpose of 
          providing you with valuable services you've requested or already have 
          through MiamiandBeaches.com. These companies may assist us in fulfilling 
          your requests or processing your transactions. We will only share information 
          with companies that work for us to provide marketing and other services 
          and with non-affiliated persons and entities with whom we have entered 
          into a joint marketing agreement, where we together market either our 
          products or those of our marketing partner if you expressly authorize 
          us to share this information. These companies are contractually forbidden 
          from disclosing or using our customer information other than to carry 
          out the purposes for which the information was disclosed. These companies 
          are in no way authorized to sell, rent or trade your personal information. 
          While there are such contractual obligations in place, we cannot and 
          do not guarantee that a third party could breach its obligation and 
          use your non-public personal information in a way contrary to our policy. 
        </p>
        <p>We may disclose information, including non-public personal information, 
          in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is 
          necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with the legal 
          process such as, but not limited to situations when we are required 
          to do so by federal, state or local laws and regulations or when we 
          receive a subpoena or are ordered by a court to do so; (b) protect and 
          defend our rights; or (c) act to protect the interests of our users 
          or others. Additionally, we may, without notice to you, provide aggregate 
          statistics about visitors to MiamiandBeaches.com, such as volume, traffic 
          patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, 
          but these statistics will include no personal information.</p>
        <p><br>
          V. E-Mail Communication from GMCVB</p>
        <p>You will only receive e-mail from the GMCVB if you have registered 
          for one of our mailing lists. If you are currently on our list and do 
          not wish to receive further information from us, see Opt-In / Opt-Out, 
          below.</p>
        <p><br>
          VI. Opt-In / Opt-Out</p>
        <p>A user may choose to remove themselves from our mailing list by following 
          the “Unsubscribe” instructions stated on our promotional 
          communications.</p>
        <p><br>
          VII. Contests/Sweepstakes Information</p>
        <p>Participation in MiamiandBeaches.com, featured/sponsored contests and 
          sweepstakes also requires the disclosure of contact and demographic 
          information. This information is required to contact users as necessary. 
          It may also be used to send you promotional information. However, users 
          may opt-out of or opt-in to our mailings at any time. (See Opt-In / 
          Opt-Out, above.)</p>
        <p><br>
          VIII. Use of Cookies</p>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of information that a website transfers to 
          your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make 
          a website more useful by allowing the site to personalize information 
          for visitors and by storing information about customer preferences on 
          a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many 
          major websites use them to provide useful features for their customers.</p>
        <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would 
          prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies. However, please 
          note that many parts of our website will not function properly if you 
          do not allow cookies. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>IX. Transmission of Information</p>
        <p>Any material, information or idea you transmit to or post on MiamiandBeaches.com, 
          by any means, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary, 
          and may be disseminated or used by the GMCVB or its affiliates for any 
          purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing 
          and marketing products. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all personal 
          data provided to the GMCVB online will be handled in accordance with 
          the GMCVB Online Privacy Practices. You are prohibited from posting 
          or transmitting to or from this website any unlawful, threatening, libelous, 
          defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic, or profane 
          material, or any other material that could give rise to any civil or 
          criminal liability under the law. </p>
        <p>X. Third Party Links</p>
        <p>MiamiandBeaches.com contains links to other sites, including those 
          of our business partners. While we try to link only to sites that share 
          our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for 
          the privacy practices employed by other sites and those other sites 
          have not agreed to our privacy policy. Visit those sites for information 
          regarding their privacy policy prior to providing personal information. 
        </p>
        <p>The links we provide on MiamiandBeaches.com are there for your reference 
          and convenience. We do not control any of these websites, nor are we 
          responsible for their content. The GMCVB does not imply any endorsement 
          of the material on such websites or any association with their operators 
          by including these links on MiamiandBeaches.com. If you decide to access 
          any of these websites you do so entirely at your own risk and you should 
          be aware that upon using these links you will leave MiamiandBeaches.com.</p>
        <p><br>
          XI. Indemnification</p>
        <p>You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold the GMCVB, and all its 
          officers, directors, owners, agents, employees, information providers, 
          affiliates, licensors and licensees (collectively, the "Indemnified 
          Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability and costs 
          incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising 
          out of any breach by you of the Agreement or the foregoing representations, 
          warranties and covenants, including, without limitation, attorneys fees 
          and costs.</p>
        <p><br>
          XII. Modification of Terms and Conditions</p>
        <p>GMCVB reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, 
          add or remove any portion of this Agreement, in whole or in part, at 
          any time. Notification of changes in the Agreement will be posted on 
          the website. GMCVB may change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of 
          the website at any time, including the availability of any website feature, 
          database, or content. GMCVB may also impose limits on certain features 
          and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the website 
          without notice or liability. By using this website you agree to be bound
