  Privacy Policy </h3>
      <div class="centerCol">
        <p>I. Policy Statement Overview</p>
        <p>This document describes the Greater Miami Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau (hereafter referred to as GMCVB) policy regarding personal information, ongoing communication, site security and overall site usage of MiamiandBeaches.com, also known as GMCVB.com, and TropicoolMiami.com. These provisions apply solely to online activities and are not necessarily applicable to practices GMCVB may engage in outside of MiamiandBeaches.com. Use of this website signifies your acceptance of the terms and conditions of use set forth in this document. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you may not access or otherwise use this website.</p>
        <p>II. Collection and Use of Personal Information</p>
        <p>Information collected on MiamiandBeaches.com is used to determine important statistical data for the GMCVB, its partners and members to determine the effectiveness of the content, programs and advertisements offered through our website.</p>
        <p>The GMCVB, its partners and affiliates may collect personal contact and demographic information that the consumer willingly provides such as name, address, zip code and e-mail address with the intention of using this information for purposes of statistical reporting and targeted promotional campaigns. Contact information may be used to send promotional materials from the GMCVB and/or its partners and affiliates. Users have the option of discontinuing the remittance of these by contacting us (please see Opt-In / Opt-Out, below).</p>
        <p>Registration areas on our site may require users to provide contact information such as an e-mail address and demographic information such as zip code. The GMCVB and/or its partners and members may use the information provided to send users relevant promotional materials.</p>
        <p><br>
    III. Security of Personal Information</p>
        <p>We exercise reasonable care to protect your non-public personal information. This includes storing the personal information on our servers behind a secured firewall and ensuring all transmissions to other vendors use secure encryption technology. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. So while we strive to protect your non-public personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. </p>
        <p>Internally, we will limit access to non-public personal information to those associates who need the information to provide products and services to you or maintain or service those products or services. These associates are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and security policies. We will review our security arrangements from time to time, as we deem appropriate.</p>
        <p><br>
    IV. Sharing of Non-Public Personal Information</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to, without notice to you, share non-public personal information with companies that work for us for the sole purpose of providing you with valuable services you've requested or already have through MiamiandBeaches.com. These companies may assist us in fulfilling your requests or processing your transactions. We will only share information with companies that work for us to provide marketing and other services and with non-affiliated persons and entities with whom we have entered into a joint marketing agreement, where we together market either our products or those of our marketing partner if you expressly authorize us to share this information. These companies are contractually forbidden from disclosing or using our customer information other than to carry out the purposes for which the information was disclosed. These companies are in no way authorized to sell, rent or trade your personal information. While there are such contractual obligations in place, we cannot and do not guarantee that a third party could breach its obligation and use your non-public personal information in a way contrary to our policy. </p>
        <p>We may disclose information, including non-public personal information, in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with the legal process such as, but not limited to situations when we are required to do so by federal, state or local laws and regulations or when we receive a subpoena or are ordered by a court to do so; (b) protect and defend our rights; or (c) act to protect the interests of our users or others. Additionally, we may, without notice to you, provide aggregate statistics about visitors to MiamiandBeaches.com, such as volume, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information.</p>
        <p><br>
    V. E-Mail Communication from GMCVB</p>
        <p>You will only receive e-mail from the GMCVB if you have registered for one of our mailing lists. If you are currently on our list and do not wish to receive further information from us, see Opt-In / Opt-Out, below.</p>
        <p><br>
    VI. Opt-In / Opt-Out</p>
        <p>A user may choose to remove themselves from our mailing list by following the “Unsubscribe” instructions stated on our promotional communications.</p>
        <p><br>
    VII. Contests/Sweepstakes Information</p>
        <p>Participation in MiamiandBeaches.com, featured/sponsored contests and sweepstakes also requires the disclosure of contact and demographic information. This information is required to contact users as necessary. It may also be used to send you promotional information. However, users may opt-out of or opt-in to our mailings at any time.
