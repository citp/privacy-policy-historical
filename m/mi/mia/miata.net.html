<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial">Privacy Policy</font></h1>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">We do not share information acquired on Miata.net with
any other party. The only exceptions to this policy are those cases where <em><strong>you</strong></em>
choose to make certain information publicly available. Examples of this include:</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Classified ads<br>
    </strong>We publish your nickname,&nbsp; and city in the ad along with the ad text. We do
    not publish your phone number unless you check the box asking that it be included in your
    ad. <br>
    <br>
    We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal<br>
    information) or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when<br>
    you create a new user profile on the site to use specific features available only to<br>
    registered users. <br>
    <br>
    The primary reason we obtain this information is to make the site easier for you to use by<br>
    not having you enter information more than once. We may also periodically use your<br>
    information to alert you to updated information and other new services from Miata.net<br>
    Classifieds. <br>
    <br>
    If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of<br>
    Miata.net Classifieds. But you will not be able to access areas or use features that<br>
    require registration.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Miata Forum<br>
    </strong>Anything you enter in the forum is publicly visible. We don't do anything with
    the information, but we can not prevent others from doing so.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Directories</strong><br>
    If you fill out the <a href="directories/dir_submit.html">Enthusiast's directory</a> or
    the <a href="directories/homepages.html">Home Pages</a> directory, anything you include on
    these forms will be published on Miata.net. We do not do anything else with the
    information. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Polls<br>
    </strong>All information in the Polls is anonymous. We do not match responses with IP
    addresses or make any other attempt to determine the identity of the responses. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Product Reviews</strong><br>
    We publish the name and email address of the reviewer unless anonymity is requested.
    Anonymous reviews may or may not be published.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Email</strong><br>
    Submissions, suggestions, comments, tech tips, photos, Miata of the Month, and other items
    which are sent in are occasionally published with the name and email address of the
    author. If you wish to remain anonymous in any email submission, please tell us. <strong>We
    do not, under any circumstances, sell, trade, or give away email addresses or any other
    personal information gathered from Miata.net.</strong></font></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4><font face="Arial">REGISTERED USER PROFILES </font></h4>

<p><font face="Arial">When you register, your information is protected by use of a
password which you select. Each person who registers must have a unique email address and
user name. Duplicate profiles using the same email address or user name are not permitted.
We highly recommend that you select a password which is neither common or known to others.
We encourage you to NOT use information such as your Social Security Number, Phone Number
or Date of Birth as your password. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you are a previous registered user and you have lost or forgotten
your password, you may only obtain it by email using our "Forgot Password"
feature. Click the link on any login page to request your password be emailed to you. We
cannot provide your password by any other means. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal
information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any
time. By following the "my profile" link provided on our system, you may view
and edit personal information you have already given us. You may also elect to receive or
discontinue receiving any email newsletters we may choose to distribute periodically. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Any other exceptions will be specifically noted on the
page itself. If you have any questions or require clarification of any portion of our
privacy policy, please <a href="feedback.html">contact us.</a></font></p>
