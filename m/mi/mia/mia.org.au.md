# MIA privacy and data security policies

### Privacy Act 1988

The Migration Institute of Australia Limited (the MIA) is a company limited by guarantee. The MIA is currently appointed by the Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs as the Migration Agents Registration Authority (the MARA) pursuant to s315 of the Migration Act 1958.

The MIA is not an organisation that is required to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 because:

  * While the MIA's total annual turnover in the last financial year was more than $3 million, the majority of that turnover of the MIA was derived from acts done as a contracted service provider for a Commonwealth contract (s.7(1)(ee) and s.7B(2));
  * The personal information that the MIA discloses about individuals who are members of the MIA is done with those members' consent (s.6D(7)(a));
  * The personal information that the MIA, through the MARA division of the MIA, discloses about individuals who have applied to be registered agents, is done with those applicants' consent (s.6D(7)(a)); and
  * The personal information that the MIA, through the MARA division of the MIA, discloses about individuals who are registered agents is authorised under Part 3 of the Migration Act 1958 (s.6D(7)(b)).



If you are a member of the MIA and the information you request relates solely to your membership of the MIA, the MIA may provide that information as a member service, rather than pursuant to the Privacy Act 1988.

### Data security

We take the security of our members' and customers' personal information seriously. All personal information entered is transmitted using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) capable of up to 256-bit encryption. The SSL Certificate is issued by Rapid SSL, an established Certification Authority. Through SSL encryption, the certificate assures that information is kept private between the mia.org.au web server and the member's or customer's web browser. The certificate validates that the mia.org.au domain is registered and that the registered owner has authorised the use of SSL technology.

Payment authorisations are conducted via a payment gateway. Payment gateways manage the process of transferring authorised credit card funds between different financial accounts. For security purposes, mia.org.au stores only the last 4 digits of our customers' credit card numbers.
