# Privacy Statement | Mimecast

## Privacy Policy

Welcome to Mimecast!  Mimecast is a global company, with offices in Europe, North America, Australia and South Africa.  We serve companies that have offices in those jurisdictions and across the world.  Our website (the “Site”), located at [www.mimecast.com](http://www.mimecast.com/), provides information about our service and is operated by Mimecast Limited.  This Privacy Policy describes how Mimecast uses and protects information collected through the Site and our marketing practices generally.

To note, if your company engages Mimecast to provide Mimecast’s service, your company and Mimecast will enter into a separate agreement that will, among other things, govern the use of all of the information and data collected and maintained by Mimecast in connection with the operation of the service, including data collected through certain features made available to customers through the Site.  Any agreement between your company and Mimecast will take precedence over any conflicting provision in this Privacy Policy. 

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or otherwise, you can reach us using the contact information provided below. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time but will use your information only as described in this Privacy Policy at the time your information was collected.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on 05 October, 2015.

## Information collected automatically

When you visit the Site, our systems automatically collect certain information about your visit, such as the type of internet browser you use, the website from which you have come to the Site and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet).  We use automatically collected information to assist us in providing and improving the Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We do not use automatically collected information to learn any information about you personally.  We may use such information to identify specific companies that are interested in our services and to market to those companies generally.

We (or our vendors) may collect non-personal information using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and similar technologies.  All of such information tells about how the website is being used and helps us tailor our website to the needs of our visitors.  We may receive reports by our vendors on an individual as well as aggregated basis. We do this to improve our marketing and the services we offer you.

We may also use automatically collected information to target advertising for our service on third party sites. For that targeting, we (or our vendors) may use cookies and web beacons to gather information about your activities on the Site in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities on the Site.  You can choose to reject certain collection technologies (such as cookies) but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.  You can read more about cookies [here](https://web.archive.org/cookie-information/).  Mimecast does not collect information about your online activities across different web sites, over time. Accordingly, Mimecast does not currently respond to “do not track” browser requests.

Our Site may include certain social media features (such as a “share” or “like” button).  Those features are provided by the applicable social media platform (such as Twitter or Facebook).  Where information is collected through the social media feature, the use of that information is governed by the privacy policy published by the social media platform that provides the feature.
