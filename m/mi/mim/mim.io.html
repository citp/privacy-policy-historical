					<span>What do you mean by <em>permission</em>?</span> 
				</a>	
				<div class="answer" name="answer1"> 
					<p>What constitutes "permission" can vary but a simply summary of it is
                    that your recipients should have given you direct permissions to email
                    them or be a recent customer of yours.  Email us anytime if you're not
                    sure if your list is permission based and we'll figure it out with you.</p>
				</div> 
			</li> 
			<li> 
				<a href="#answer2" class="question">		
					<span>Can I send to old lists?</span> 
 				</a> 
				<div class="answer" name="answer2"> 
					<p>Sending to old and non-responsive emails is a drag on your delivery and
                    an old list can cause more trouble than good but there are some
                    techniques to send safely. Send only to those who've been actively in
                    contact with you and receptive to your emails in the last year or so.</p>
				</div> 				
			</li> 
			<li> 
				<a href="#answer3" class="question"> 
					<span>How do I know if my list is legit?</span> 
 				</a>
				<div class="answer" name="answer3"> 
					<p>Let's discuss this! Email us anytime with some details about how you
                    collected your contacts and we'll help out. If the answer to "Did they
                    signup directly with you to receive emails?" is a resounding "Yes!"
                    then you're good to go!</p>
