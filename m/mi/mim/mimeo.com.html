								<p>Mimeo.com.,Inc. ("Mimeo") recognizes that your privacy and the protection of your personal information is important to you and is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the measures taken by us to protect your privacy in connection with your use of www.mimeo.com (our "Site"). This Privacy Statement discloses our collection, use and storage practices surrounding the personal information we collect from you. “Personal Information” is defined as the information such as your name, and email that can be used to identify you.</p>
                                <p>This policy was last modified on February 9, 2009.</p>
                                <p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY USING OUR SITE AND THE RELATED SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIMEO OR ITS DESIGNEES (THE "SERVICES"), YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS POLICY.</p>
                                <p>Our full Privacy Policy is given below, but here are a few key points:</p>
                                <ul class="bullet-list">
                                	<li>We will not sell, lease, or share your personal information with any other companies, except those who need it to help us serve you (e.g. providing your name, and address to our third party shipping agent and payment processor -with whom we share your financial information to fulfill payment).</li>
                                    <li>We will not spam you. For those few emails that we do send out, we always include a way for you to unsubscribe from any and all non-essential communications.</li>
                                    <li>When you submit any form or upload any document to our Site, we use Secure Socket Layer Technology. Secure Socket Layer technology protects your information, using both server authentication and data encryption, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and available only to registered users.</li>
                                    <li>Once your documents have been uploaded, they are hosted in our secure server environment. We use firewalls and other advanced technologies to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.</li>
                                   </ul>
                                  <p>Mimeo is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
                                  <p>Mimeo adheres to the European Union Safe Harbor principles as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information covered by the Privacy Policy from the European Union.</p>
                                  <p>For all questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact customer care at <a href="mailto:customercare@mimeo.com">customercare@mimeo.com</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact <a href="https://www.truste.org/pvr.php?page=complaint" target="_blank">TRUSTe</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Mimeo to resolve your concerns.</p>
                                  <p>By displaying the TRUSTe Trustmark, we have agreed to notify you of:</p>
                                  <ul class="bullet-list">
                                  	<li>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable information is collected from you through the Site</li>
                                    <li>The organization collecting the information</li>
   									<li>How the information is used</li>
   									<li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
   									<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information</li>
   									<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Mimeo control</li>
  									<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from this Site. </p>
                                    <p><b>What information is collected by Mimeo:</b></p>
                                    <p>In order to use the Services, you are required to provide us with an e-mail address and a unique password. In addition, when placing an order with our Site, you are required to provide personally identifying and other information such as your name, phone number, address, payment information (including credit card information), and shipping information (such as third party shipping addresses and shipping preferences).</p>
                                    <p>Cookies. Our Site uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information such as aggregate use statistics for internal evaluation of our Services. We also use cookies to temporarily identify users as "logged in" to our secure servers. We do not link any personally identifiable information to the information stored in cookies. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to use our Site, since our databases would no longer be able to identify you as "logged in," and you may also be unable to fully experience the interactive features of other websites you visit.</p>
                                    <p>Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our Site to help us administer our Site and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personally identifiable information.</p>
                                    <p><b>Children's personally identifiable information:</b></p>
                                    <p>The Services are neither directed toward children (under thirteen years of age), nor is it made available to children. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information or accept orders from children.</p>
                                    <p><b>How the information collected is used:</b></p>
                                    <p>The information collected from you when you place an order with our Site is used to contact you in the normal course of business (e.g. shipping documents and confirmation emails). Every time you place an order, we will send you a confirmation regarding your order status using the e-mail address that you have provided. You will know exactly when we have received your order, when the printing job is completed and even when we submit your documents to our partner carriers for shipping. Once your order has been submitted to the carrier, all delivery service and tracking information is provided by the carrier. We also use your email to send you newsletters and promotions from our Site when you opt to receive this information from us. </p>
                                    <p>We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our Customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Site.</p>
                                    <p>Mimeo does not share any personally identifiable information with third party parties fro their promotional purposes. In addition, Mimeo will not use or share your personal information in a manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your prior consent.</p>
                                    <p><b>Choice/Opt-out:</b></p>
                                    <p>Mimeo believes that all emails it sends to you after you sign up for an account are designed to help you best use the Services. The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the customer with a method of "opting out" of receiving future communications of a similar nature. Non-essential communications, such as surveys or contests will not be shared with users who have opted out from our mailing list. Such individuals will only receive communications that are necessary for Mimeo to fulfill orders and provide customer service (e.g. -confirmation email, delivery notification, etc). Please note that these communications are part of your Service and you generally cannot opt-out of them as a result.</p>
                                    <p>To opt out of receiving non-essential communications, such as newsletters and promotions, users can click the "unsubscribe" link that is included at the bottom of any and all such communications.</p>
                                    <p><b>When your information may be disclosed:</b></p>
                                    <p>Mimeo reserves the right to disclose information or documents concerning or submitted by you as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business, including but not limited to complying with a judicial order or with government agencies or law enforcement officials. Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information or documents when: you are in violation of our Terms and Conditions or other published guidelines; you partake (or are reasonably suspected of partaking) in any infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order; in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law; as well as in response to allegations of infringement or illegality.</p>
                                    <p>In the event of a sale, acquisition or merger of some, or all of Mimeo’s assets, your personal information would likely be a part of the transferred assets. In such an event, we shall notify you via a notice on our Site prior to the transfer, or by email, with your choices on how your information is to be used henceforth.</p>
                                    <p><b>Surveys, Sweepstakes and Contests:</b></p>
                                    <p>Occasionally, Mimeo may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content, and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form. In addition, if we sponsor a contest/sweepstakes or promotion in conjunction with a third party, we will post relevant privacy information at the point of registration for that specific contest/sweepstakes or promotion so you can determine whether you wish to participate. Mimeo will handle personal information it receives as a result of a joint contest/sweepstakes or promotion or where Mimeo is the sole sponsor in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Blog Disclosure:</b></p>
									<p>When you select to comment on our blog, you should be aware that any personal information you select to disclose within your comment can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information that you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
                        <p><b>How you may  access &amp; update your information:</b></p>
                                    <p>If you would like to change your personally identifiable information in our databases, you may do so through your Account Profile, or by contacting our customer care team. We will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request. We shall respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receiving it. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within Mimeo databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however Mimeo reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former users of the Services for the purpose of informing them of changes in our service or hours of service.</p>
                                    <p><b>How your information is protected:</b></p>
                                    <p>Mimeo uses an industry-standard security technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL Encryption), a protocol developed by Netscape, for the secure transmission of sensitive information over the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that are transmitted over the SSL connection. Current versions of the Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer and America Online browsers support SSL, as do other browsers, and our Site uses SSL  encryption when you transmit sensitive  information, such as credit card numbers. Your document is uploaded to us using the same encryption settings your browser uses when connecting to our Site. Web pages that require an SSL connection generally start with "https" instead of "http", although some pages and frames within pages may be encrypted even without the https address. Your browser's help files can show you how to verify whether a particular page utilizes SSL.</p>
                                    <p><b>Updates to this privacy policy:</b></p>
                                    <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last modified" date at the top of the Privacy Policy. If Mimeo changes any of its policies that affect users' personally identifiable information, the changes will be posted in this document, and prominently on the public and private web sites (<a href="http://www.mimeo.com">www.mimeo.com</a> and <a href="http://my.mimeo.com">my.mimeo.com</a>) for 30 consecutive business days prior to the implementation of those changes. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>
                                    <p><b>Terms &amp; Conditions:</b></p>
                                    <p>Please also visit our Terms &amp; Conditions section establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of our Site at <a href="http://www.mimeo.com/legal/terms-and-conditions.html">http://www.mimeo.com/legal/terms-and-conditions.html</a>.</p>
                                    <p><b>Third party links:</b></p>
                                    <p>The Mimeo web site may contain links to other Internet web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites, which may or may not be owned or operated by Mimeo. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers our Site and does not cover any other website. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. We strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).</p>
