                      required to provide us with an e-mail address and a unique 
                      password. In addition, when placing an order with Mimeo.com, 
                      each Customer is required to provide personally identifying 
                      and other information such as the Customer's name, phone 
                      number, address, payment information (including credit card 
                      information), and shipping information (such as third party 
                      shipping addresses and shipping preferences). This information 
                      is used to contact the customer in the normal course of 
                      business (e.g. shipping documents and confirmation emails). 
                      Mimeo will not share our customers' users personally identifiable 
                      information for any reason other than what is stated in

                      <br>
                      Mimeo.com also collects non-personally identifiable information 
                      such as aggregate use statistics, for internal evaluation 
                      of our services. We collect such non-personally identifiable 
                      information in part through the use of "cookies" 
                      (small text files placed on your computer's harddrive). 
                      Cookies are used to temporarily identify users as "logged 
                      in" to our secure servers. A user's refusal of cookies 
                      wouldrender the site virtually unusable, since our databases 
                      would no longer be able to identify that user as "logged 
                      in." We do not link any personally identifiable information

                      of the e-mail and provide the customer with a method of

                      <br>
                      Mimeo.com uses an industry-standard security technology 
                      called Secure Socket Layer (SSL), a protocol developed by 
                      Netscape for the secure transmission of private information 
                      over the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt 
                      data that are transmitted over the SSL connection. Current 
                      versions of the Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer and 
                      America Online browsers support SSL, as do other browsers, 
                      and Mimeo.com's Web site uses SSL when its customers transmit 
                      confidential information, such as credit card numbers. Your 
                      document is uploaded to us using the same encryption settings 
                      your browser uses when connecting to our site. Web pages 
                      that require an SSL connection generally start with "https" 
                      instead of "http", although some pages and frames 
                      within pages may be encrypted even without the https address. 
                      Your browser's help files can show you how to verify whether 
                      a particular page utilizes SSL. For more information on 
                      SSL, please visit the Webopedia site.<br>
                      <br>
                      Every time you place an order, we will send you confirmation 
                      regarding your order status using the e-mail address that 
                      you have provided. You will know exactly when we have received 
                      your order, when the printing job is completed and even 
                      when we submit your documents to our partner carriers for 
                      shipping. Once your order has been submitted to the carrier, 
                      all delivery service and tracking information is provided 
                      by the carrier.<br>

                      While Mimeo.com encourages all third parties involved to
