This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information in connection with our websites, mobile apps, and other services, and explains the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information. For convenience, our websites and mobile apps are collectively referred to as the “Sites,” and, together with our other services, collectively referred to as the “Services.” This Privacy Policy governs any of the Services on which the Privacy Policy is posted.

Individuals located in the European Union should be sure to read the important information provided here.

  * **Purposes of Processing Your Information:** We process information about you in order to provide our Sites and Services; to communicate with you; to comply with law and prevent fraud; and for other reasons with your consent. We may also anonymize your data – which means the data can no longer be used to identify you – in order to perform analytics to learn how to better provide our Sites and Services.
  * **Your Rights and Choices:** Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have legal rights associated with our processing of your data, including rights to access, correct, delete, transfer, or object to the processing of your data. Regardless of where you live, we will honor your request to opt out of being contacted by us for marketing reasons.

Our Data Protection Officer may be contacted by emailing [dataprivacy@mdsol.com](mailto:dataprivacy@mdsol.com). However, please note that Medidata’s customers are the controllers of your data when it is processed in Medidata’s platform, applications, and related services. For example, if you are a patient in a clinical trial, or an investigator who logs into our applications, your data controller is the Sponsor of that trial and/or the participating healthcare provider.

## **Cookies and Similar Technologies**

### **What are cookies?**

We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. 

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. 

### **Cookies we use**

Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below: 

  * **Essential Cookies**. These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services. These are primarily used by our employees and contractors.

  * **Functionality Cookies**. These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences or re-enter information every time you visit our Site.
  * **Analytics and Performance Cookies**. These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day and duration they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site. We primarily use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Site works. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) and about how Google protects your data [here](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).
  * **Targeted and Advertising Cookies**. These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising on a third party site which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. You can disable certain cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting [this site](http://youronlinechoices.eu/). If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioural advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.



### **Disabling cookies**

You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. 

Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site. 

### **Flash Technology**

We may use supporting technologies for our Sites that use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local Shared Object (“LSOs”)) on our Site to collect and store information about your use of our Site. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not want Flash cookies stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel at [this website](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Site.

### **On-Site Tracking**

We may also use tracking tags (which are also known as web beacons) on our Site to track the actions of users while on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, tracking tags are embedded on webpages. Tags compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using tracking tags is not linked to our users’ personal data.

We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites you visit and services you use.

We may make available on our Sites, or link to, features that allow you to share information online (e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through events, etc.). Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. We have no control over, and take no responsibility for, the use, storage or dissemination of such publicly-disclosed personal information.
