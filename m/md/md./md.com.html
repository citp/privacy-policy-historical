<p>
    We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site, such as: (1) information about your IP Address, Mobile Device, and Browser; (2) the types of computers accessing the Site; (3) referring source which may have sent You to the Site; and (4) other information associated with the interaction of Your browser and the Site.
</p>


<a name="personal_information_md_collects"><h2>Personal Information MD.com Collects?</h2></a>
<p>
    To use the Site, we may require You to provide us with certain information that personally identifies You (“Personal Information”).  MD.com may ask You for Personal Information when You sign up for an account, complete optional survey forms, fill out optional contact forms for additional information on particular products and services or use a particular service.  You can determine, to a large extent, what Personal Information You wish to submit on a voluntary basis to MD.com. 
</p>
<p>
    Personal Information may include: (1) contact data (such as Your e-mail address, phone number and Site password); and (2) demographic data (such as Your gender, Your date of birth and Your zip code).

<a name="why_does_md_ask_for_your_personal_information"><h2>Why does MD.com ask for Your Personal Information?</h2></a>
<p>
    We regularly make improvements to our Site to provide You with a more personalized and useful experience.

Through the use of Cookies and on-line data entry, survey, product purchase and registration forms, MD.com may monitor, in aggregate and individual form, Personal Information.  Although Our primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to deliver a customized and personalized service to the users of the Site, We may also use Personal Information to: (i) send users e-mail notification of new features or information available through the Site or that MD.com otherwise feels might be of interest to users of this Site; and (ii) allow third party advertisers and retailers, and their affiliates, offering goods or services that MD.com thinks might be of interest to users to deliver relevant information and offers to users.  We also collect IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and to report aggregate information to Our advertisers and others.

<p>
    We are not a "covered entity" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, in effect or as amended (collectively known and referred to as "HIPAA").  Although We are not covered by HIPAA, We are committed to user privacy and have in place strict data security policies and measures, and ensure that users control access to their information.  
</p>
<p>

<a name="collection_of_cookies_and_use_of_web_beacons"><h2>Collection of Cookies and Use of Web Beacons</h2></a>
<p>
    To enhance Your online experience, We may use small computer files that are transferred to Your computer's hard drive that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while browsing the Site (“Cookies”).  Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once You choose to furnish a site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
</p>
<p>
    We use Cookies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our sites.  For example, we may use cookies to personalize Your experience at our sites (e.g., to recognize You by name when you return to a site), save Your password in password-protected areas, and enable You to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer You products, programs, or services that may be of interest to You and to deliver relevant advertising.
</p>
<p>
    In limited circumstances we also may use tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its home server information from the user’s browser (“Web Beacons”) to collect anonymous, non-personal information about Your use of our Services and the sites of selected sponsors and advertisers, and your use of emails, special promotions or newsletters we send to you. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using the Services and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites, or opening our emails, and for what purposes.
</p>

<a name="our_use_of_website_analytics"><h2>Our Use of Website Analytics</h2></a>
<p>
    We may use third party website analytics services in connection with the services provided on our Site.  For example, we may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, as well as any text that You type into the Site. These website analytics services do not collect Personal Information that You do not voluntarily enter into the Site. These services do not track Your browsing habits across websites which do not use their services.  We use the information collected from these services to find usability problems to make the Services easier to use. The recordings will never identify You or Your account; they only record anonymous user information.
</p>

<a name="its_your_choice_to_provide_personal_information"><h2>It’s Your Choice to Provide Personal Information</h2></a>
<p>
    You may always choose not to provide us with any Personal Information.  If you do not provide Personal Information, you can still access and use some of the MD.com services; however you will not be able to access and use certain key features of the Site that require your Personal Information.
</p>

<a name="what_other_choices_do_you_have"><h2>What other choices do you have?</h2></a>
<p>
    Most computer systems and browsers offer their own privacy settings.  We encourage you to use them to enhance your choices.  Most browsers’ advanced settings allow you to disable cookies.  However, if you do so, some site features and services may not work.  Also, you must remember to manage your cookie settings for each computer and browser you use to access the Internet.
</p>

<a name="information_provided_on_behalf_of_children"><h2>Information Provided on Behalf of Children</h2></a>
<p>
    MD.com does not collect information from children under the age of 13 in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) as discussed below.  If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you may, use our Site on behalf of such minor child.  Any information that you provide us while using the services on our Site on behalf of your minor child will be treated as Personal Information as otherwise provided herein.
</p>

<a name="childrens_online_privacy_protection_act"><h2>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</h2></a>
<p>
    COPPA severely restricts what information can be collected from children under the age of 13.  For this reason, children under the age of 13 in the United States are prohibited from using the our services. The Site and our services are not directed at children, and MD.com does not knowingly collect any information from individuals under the age of 13.  If we learn that we have received any information from an individual under the age of 13, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or a parent or legal guardian) to inform him or her that he or she cannot use the Site services and subsequently we will delete that information from our own servers.
</p>

<a name="keeping_information_confidential_and_secure"><h2>Keeping Information Confidential and Secure</h2></a>
<p>
    Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you is necessary to: (1) comply with a court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of Powered by Doctors, Inc. or another party; (3) enforce our Terms of Use; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third-parties.
</p>
<p>
    The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our Site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”).
</p>
<p>
    Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information.  If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.
</p>

<a name="you_may_change_or_delete_your_information"><h2>You May Change or Delete Your Information</h2></a>
<p>
    As a registered User of MD.com, you can modify some of the Personal Information you have included in your profile or change your username by logging in and accessing your account.  Upon your request, We will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your account and the Personal Information in your profile; however, it may be impossible to remove your account without some residual information being retained by MD.com.
</p>
<p>
    When you delete your account, you understand that removed certain content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).  Furthermore, to the extent Personal Information about you has been shared with others, or other Users have independently uploaded and/or retained information about you, such information may also remain.
