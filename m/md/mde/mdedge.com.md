This privacy policy sets forth what information we collect about you, how we use, maintain and disclose your information, and the choices you have with respect to your information.

We may also append information provided to us by third parties to personally identifiable information that you provide to us. “Usage information” is information automatically collected by our web server (which may be hosted by a third-party) that your web browser makes available whenever you visit or use our Site, such as the Internet Protocol ("IP") address used to connect your computer to the Internet or your computer's browser type.
