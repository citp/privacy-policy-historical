The privacy of our users on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Since MDLinx, its related network of sites, and its services do gather certain types of information about our users, we feel that you should completely understand the conditions and terms surrounding the gathering and use of information about those using our sites and services. This Privacy Policy Statement divulges what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. In the policy, the pronouns "you" and "your" are used to refer to the end user, while "we," "us" and "our" are used to refer to MDLinx. 

By visiting MDLinx or one of its specialty sites, or by using one of its services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy Statement. We may amend this Statement at any time; if we make changes to our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. This Statement was last revised on **September 5, 2006**. Any questions regarding our Privacy Policy Statement should be directed to MDLinx ( [support@mdlinx.com](mailto:support@mdlinx.com)) for clarification and further elaboration. 

**1\. Collecting Information**

MDLinx gathers and tracks information/data that users provide through registration on our sites for some services. In addition to this gathering of information by the registration of users, MDLinx also gathers information through an aggregated tracking system that derives data mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites and capturing information on the type of browser being used to view the site. This information enables us to better provide content and to respond to our users' needs. It also is used to help our advertisers and sponsors to better understand the demographics of our audience. As MDLinx derives its revenue mainly from advertising on our sites, it is necessary for us to provide such aggregated demographic data to our sponsors and advertisers; this allows us to keep our services free to users. _MDLinx does not divulge any personal information about an individual user to any third party except in the case of a market research study where the answers you provide may be disclosed but not your identity._

MDLinx may gather information on our users in the following ways: 

  * Registration   
Some MDLinx services require user registration. For the registration process, MDLinx may require some information, like name, email address and profession, while other information requested will be voluntary and optional. Information collected in the registration process is never shared with third parties in a personally identifiable way. 
  * Electronic newsletters   
All the sites in the MDLinx network offer free electronic newsletters to users, providing specific information to them on the appropriate topics. To provide this service, MDLinx must gather the email addresses of users who register for and voluntarily subscribe to said service. You may remove yourself from an MDLinx mailing list at any time by following the instructions provided at the end of every newsletter 
  * Market Research Studies   
Users of MDLinx may elect to participate in market research surveys that the company runs from time to time. These studies are intended to give specific feedback to third parties. This feedback while shared in the format it was collected will not include the personally identifiable information used to pay honoraria for your time. 
  * Discussion Lists   
Users of MDLinx discussion lists must subscribe to them separately. Subscribing to any of our free email newsletters does not also subscribe users to affiliated discussion lists. A user must register for this free service and must agree to the terms and conditions of the service. You may remove yourself from a discussion list at any time by following the instructions provided. 
  * Usage tracking   
MDLinx uses traffic analysis software on our servers to track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. This information is not correlated with personal information about specific individual users. MDLinx does use this data to break down overall usage statistics according to IP address, domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the data automatically sent by the browser whenever a web page is requested. 
  * Cookies   
A cookie is a small text file that resides only on your own computer and that can be accessed only by the server that originally created the cookie. A cookie cannot store or send back any information to MDLinx that you have not specifically and voluntarily provided while on an MDLinx site, or that is not among the information mentioned above that is contained in every user's browser (i.e., domain name, browser type). We use cookies only so that we may tally the number of unique users who visit our sites, and potentially to permit greater personalization of the site to your preferences and specifications. Even when you may have provided to MDLinx information that is stored in a cookie on your computer, MDLinx will not share personally identifiable information about you to third parties. 

  
**2\. Sharing of the information**

MDLinx uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We do not share information about an individual user’s identity with any third party. MDLinx will divulge identifiable information only as necessary to comply with state and federal laws. 

Please note that MDLinx does not control the practices of the advertisers on their sites. When you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy statement whenever interacting with any web site. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers uses information about you when you click their ad, visit their site, and view their content, please contact them directly. 

**3\. "No-spam" policy**

Your email address will not be sold to a third party if you sign up for one of our MDLinx email newsletters, market research programs, or discussion lists. If you sign up for an email newsletter or discussion list at an MDLinx site, you will receive only the email newsletter or discussion list you have requested. You may receive on occasion an offer from MDLinx to sign up for a new newsletter or discussion list, or information about other MDLinx services, but you will not receive additional newsletters or discussion list mailings unless you specifically have requested them or have otherwise opted in for third-party announcements (see Opt-in Announcement List Privacy Policy below). 

**4\. Delete/deactivate policy**

Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters or discussion lists at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter or discussion list, and also on the web site. If you no longer wish to use any MDLinx services or receive any information from MDLinx, you may request to have your personal information removed from MDLinx's databases by sending a request via email ([support@mdlinx.com](mailto:support@mdlinx.com)) or by fax (202-293-1690), including your first and last names and email address with which you originally registered. Changes or corrections to your information may be submitted in the same fashion. 

**Opt-in Announcement List Privacy Policy**

When you register for MDLinx services you may be given the option of joining an opt-in list. If you choose to sign up, you will receive information or participate in campaigns relevant to the specialty you selected from select third parties who have entered into agreements with MDLinx. You may have your email address removed from the MDLinx opt-in announcement lists at any time by deselecting the opt-in list option. MDLinx is not responsible for the content of emails you may receive when you have elected to opt-in to a particular specialty.
