				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<div id="map-left">

					<p>
The privacy of our users on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Since M3 USA Corporation ("M3"), its related network of sites and services (including the MDLinx.com site, its specialty sites, thesmartestoncologist.com site and any similar M3 sites, (all such sites collectively the "Sites")) do gather certain types of information about our users, we feel that you should completely understand the conditions and terms surrounding the gathering and use of information about those using our Sites and services. This Privacy Policy Statement divulges what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. In the policy, the pronouns "you" and "your" are used to refer to the end user, while "we," "us" and "our" are used to refer to M3. 					</p>
					<p>
                   By visiting one of the Sites, or by using a Site's services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy Statement. We may amend this Statement at any time; if we make changes to this Statement, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. This Statement was last revised on Sept 30, 2010. Any questions regarding our Privacy Policy Statement should be directed to M3   (<a href="mailto:support@usa.m3.com">support@usa.m3.com</a>) for clarification and further elaboration. 
					</p>

					<h3>1. Collecting &amp; Sharing Information</h3>
					<p>
       				M3 gathers and tracks information/data that users provide through registration on our Sites for some services. In addition to this gathering of information by the registration of users, M3 also gathers information through tracking systems, depending on the service being used by you. The tracking systems include deriving data by tallying page views throughout our Sites and capturing information on the type of browser being used to view the Site, tracking what pages you have visited while on the Site and in market research studies tracking what computers respond to a survey. This information enables us to better provide content and to respond to our users' needs. Taken together, these aggregate site usage data also  helps our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. As M3 derives its revenue mainly from advertising on our Sites, it is necessary for us to provide such demographic data to our sponsors and advertisers; this allows us to keep our services free to users
					</p>
                    
                    
				<h3>Rules on Information Sharing</h3> 
                    <ol style="margin-left:30px; ">
                      <li>Your email address is your property and M3 will not divulge it to any third party.  </li>

                      <li>When you participate in a market research or marketing program, information you provide can be provided to the program sponsor:
                        <ul>
                        <li style="margin-left:20px; list-style:disc;">When you take part in market research, your identity as a participant may be shared, but your answers remain anonymous.  </li>
                        <li style="margin-left:20px;list-style:disc;">If you take part in a sponsored promotional program, such as "Messages" your identity and the information you provide (answers to questions, requests for information, etc.) will be provided to the program's sponsor.</li>
                        </ul>
                       </li>
                       <li>In quiz games your name may appear on the LeaderBoard. Your answers are not shared.</li>
                    </ol>

                    
                    
                    
					<p>M3 may gather information about our members in the following ways:</p>
                    <br>
					<h4>Registration</h4>
					<p>
					Some Site services require user registration. For the registration process, we may require some information, like name, email address, zip code and profession, while other information requested will be voluntary and optional. Information collected in the registration process is never shared with third parties in a personally identifiable way other than in the instances described above under "Rules of Information Sharing", when you elect to participate in a sponsored program or take part in a quiz program Site.. 
       				</p>
					<h4>Electronic Newsletters</h4>
					<p>
					The MDLinx sites offer free electronic newsletters to users, providing specific information to them on the appropriate topics. To provide these services, we must gather the email addresses of users who register for and voluntarily subscribe to said services. You may remove yourself from an MDLinx mailing list at any time by following the instructions provided at the end of every newsletter. M3 will never share your email address with third parties without your explicit permission.                    </p>
					<h4>Emails</h4>
					<p>
					By registering with our Sites you agree that we may send you emails regarding information specific to such Site, surveys or opportunities involving other M3 services and Sites. To provide these services, we must gather the email addresses of users who register for said Site(s). You may remove yourself from these mailing lists at any time by terminating the service. 
                    </p>
					<h4>Market Research Studies</h4>
					<p>
					Users of the Sites may elect to participate in market research surveys that M3 runs from time to time. These studies are intended to give specific anonymous feedback to third parties. This feedback, while shared in the format it was collected, will not be shared in manner that is correlated to your personally identifiable information used to pay honoraria for your time. All participants may be disclosed to such third parties by a unique identifier but such identifier will not be associated with any specific feedback. 				
                    </p>
					<h4>Discussion Lists</h4>

					<p>
					Users of discussion lists must subscribe to them separately. Subscribing to any of our free email newsletters does not also subscribe users to affiliated discussion lists.

                    </p>

					<p>
					M3 uses traffic analysis software on our servers to track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. M3 uses this data to break down overall usage statistics according to IP address, domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the data automatically sent by the browser whenever a web page is requested. Additionally, solely in connection with your voluntarily participation in a market research study, your computer may be tracked by digital fingerprinting or watermarking to help ensure unique responders to a survey. 
                    </p>
					<h4>Cookies</h4>
					<p>
				A cookie is a small text file that resides only on your own computer and that can be accessed only by the server that originally created the cookie. A cookie cannot store or send back any information to us that you have not specifically and voluntarily provided while on a Site, or that is not among the information mentioned above that is contained in every user's browser (e.g.., domain name, browser type). We use cookies so that we may tally the number of unique users who visit our Sites, and potentially to permit greater personalization of the Sites to your preferences and specifications.                     </p>
					<h4>Industry Sponsored Programs</h4>

					<p>
				You may be offered the opportunity to participate in special programs from advertisers, such as our “Messages” programs or other industry supported events and web resources.  Members who participate agree that their name, specialty, profession, the messages they read and their answers to questions to which they respond can be shared with the industry sponsor. Members may cease participating in these programs at any time. 					</p>
                    
                    <p>

If you sign up for an email newsletter or discussion list at an MDLinx Site, you will receive only the email newsletter or discussion list you have requested. You may receive occasional offers from us to sign up for a new newsletter, discussion list or quiz program, or information about other M3 services, but you will not receive additional newsletters or discussion list mailings unless you specifically have requested them or have otherwise opted in for third-party announcements (see Opt-in Announcement List Privacy Policy below).                     </p>

If you no longer wish to use any of our services or receive any information from us, you may request to have your personal information removed from our databases by sending a request via email (support@usa.m3.com) or by fax (202-293-1690), including your first and last names and email address with which you originally registered. Changes or corrections to your information may be submitted in the same fashion.
