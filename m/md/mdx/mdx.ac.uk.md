# Privacy | Middlesex University London

The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) (the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR from May 2018) protects the rights of individuals by setting out certain rules as to what organisations can and cannot do with information about people. A key element to this is the principle to process individuals’ data lawfully and fairly. In order to meet the fairness part of this we need to provide information on how we process personal data.

The University takes its obligations under the Data Protection Act very seriously and will always ensure personal data is collected, handled, stored and shared in a secure manner.

The following statement will outline what personal data we collect, how we use it and who we share it with. It will also provide guidance on your individual rights and how to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office, the regulator for data protection in the UK.

The University’s official contact details are:

## How and why does the University use personal data?

The largest volume of personal data the University processes is in relation to students, at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. The primary purposes we process information about these individuals include:

  * to enable us to administer student-related functions from original applications through to graduation and to provide alumni services;
  * to plan and account for the use of the services provided;
  * to produce information including statistics for relevant external agencies such as the Higher Education Statistical Agency (HESA) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) which allocates funds to the University on the basis of student numbers;
  * to enable University staff to communicate with students;
  * to monitor academic progress over the period of enrolment towards completion of a qualification;

## Sharing of personal data

The University is required to share personal data with certain other organisations in order to meet statutory requirements or to provide services to students. Sharing will always be undertaken in line with the requirements of data protection law, either through the consent of the individual, or another relevant legal gateway.

## How long does the University keep personal data?

The University takes its obligations under the DPA very seriously in terms of not holding onto personal data for any longer than is necessary. The University has a retention schedule in place for the different categories of data it holds.

  * to deal with complaints, appeals and disciplinary cases;

## Your rights

An individual has the right to ask the University what personal data we hold about them, and to ask for a copy of that information. This is called making a [Data Protection Subject Access Request](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/444333/Subject-Access-Request-Policy-20170927.pdf).

A Subject Access Request should be submitted in writing via email to the [Data Protection Officer](mailto:dpaofficer@mdx.ac.uk) or in hard copy to the postal address provided above. The University reserves the right to ask you to provide proof of identification and for you to clarify your request if it is unclear in the first instance. You will receive a reply no longer than 40 calendar days from the date you make the request in writing.

If you are unhappy with the initial response you can ask the University to undertake a further search if there is specific information you have good reason to believe exists but that hasn’t been provided.

You also have the right to complain to the UK Regulator the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO’s) if you believe you request has not been dealt with properly or you have a complaint to raise against the University for any other data protection related issue. A complaint can be raised via the [ICO’s website](https://www.ico.org.uk/concerns) or write to the following address:

The Office of the Information Commissioner  
Wycliffe House  
Water Lane  
Wilmslow  
Cheshire  
SK9 5AF

You also have the right to withdraw consent from the processing of your personal data by the University at any time, if your consent was sought initially to use your personal data.

### Right to rectify

From May 2018 you will also have a number of new individual rights under the GDPR. The means to exercise these new rights with the University will be published early 2018 in the run-up to the rights coming into effect.

### Your responsibilities
