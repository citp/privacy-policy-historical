To do this Middlesex University complies with the Data Protection Principles which are set out in the 1998 Act. In summary these state that personal data shall be:

  * processed fairly and lawfully and shall not be processed unless certain conditions are met.

  * adequate, relevant and not excessive.
  * accurate and where necessary up to date.
  * kept for no longer than necessary.
  * processed in accordance with data subjects' rights.
  * protected by appropriate security.
  * not transferred without adequate protection. The University is committed to ensuring that current employees comply with this Act regarding the confidentiality of any personal data held by the University, in whatever medium.



The site carries information that is already publicly available, such as organisational structures, membership and responsibilities of governing bodies and committees, staff contacts list, photographs of key staff, list of students to whom awards have been made or are likely to be made by the University. Wherever necessary, permissions have been sought before publication of material.  Information that is already publicly available is exempt from the 1998 Act. It is the policy of Middlesex University to make public as much information about the University as possible.
