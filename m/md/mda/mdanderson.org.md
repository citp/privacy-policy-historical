**Privacy Policy**

This is how we handle the information we learn from you when you visit The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center web site (www.mdanderson.org). The information we receive depends on what you do during your visit. 

**Web Server**  
Our web server collects and stores the following general information about you: 

  * the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account); 
  * the date and time you access our service; 
  * the pages you visit; 
  * the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to us. 
  * the name and release number of web browser software you are using. 



This information is collected automatically and is not linked to your personal identity. It is used in an aggregate way to help us improve our web site and make it more useful to you. We do not use cookies to collect information. 

**Online Forms & Email Communication  
**We do not obtain personal information (e.g. name, address, e-mail address, etc.) about you when you visit the M. D. Anderson web site unless you choose voluntarily to provide such information to us. 

If you identify yourself by sending an e-mail, by using a form like "Contact Us," or by registering to receive information from us, there are a few things you should know. 

  * Various people at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center may see the material you submit. 
  * We may enter the information you send into our electronic database, to share with our physicians, other health care professionals, researchers, or our Internet services staff. 
  * In other limited circumstances, including requests from legal authorities, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit. 



You should note that electronic mail and other Internet communications channels are not necessarily secure against interception. While we take precautions, such as encrypting communications where appropriate, if your communication is very sensitive, or includes information like your diagnosis or medical history, you might want to send it by postal mail instead.

Our patient message boards collect and store the following information about you:

  * First Name, Last Name & Email Address

Patient communications on the message boards are not private and can be seen by a community of cancer discussion participants. Message boards offer a chance for patients to share concerns and ideas they have about cancer and its impact on their lives.

**Under no circumstances will we ever disclose (to a third party) personal information about individual medical conditions or interests, except when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.**

With few exceptions, you are entitled on your request to be informed about the information M. D. Anderson Cancer Center collects about you.  Under Sections 552.021 and 552.023 of the Texas Government Code, you are entitled to receive and review the information.
