# Website Privacy Policy | MD Anderson Cancer Center

**_Information You Provide To Us_**

We collect information you provide directly to us through the Sites. For example, we collect information when you create an account, subscribe to receive notifications, make a donation or a purchase, apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us through the Sites.  


The information we collect from you may include personal information. “Personal Information” is information that, whether alone or in combination with other information, can be used to identify an individual (such as first and last name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number, payment card information, or date of birth).  Information that has been de-identified such that it cannot be connected to an individual is not considered Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.   


_**Information We Collect Automatically**_  


When you access or use the Sites, certain information about your use of the Sites may be collected automatically.  For example, we may collect your IP address, device identifier, browser type, domain name, operating system characteristics, data regarding the device you’re using, and information about your visit, such as access times, duration, and how you arrived at the Sites.  This usage information may be combined with Personal Information, in which case we would treat the combined information as Personal Information.   


In addition to logging information about your visit, we may use various tracking mechanisms such as cookies, web beacons (also known as tracking pixels), and embedded scripts (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to automatically collect information about interactions with our Sites or e-mails.  


  * **Cookies** are small text files that a web page server places on your hard drive. The use of cookies is a common practice on many websites. We may place cookies on your computer to allow us to recognize you on the Sites during future visits, to measure web traffic, to offer you certain products or services, or to customize your visit. We use both session ID cookies and tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Sites, and they expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies help us understand how you use the Sites and enhance your user experience, and they remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  
  
Your Internet browser may include settings that permit you to block cookies or to be notified when cookies are placed. Please be aware that if you use these mechanisms to block or remove cookies, certain features and functions of the Sites may be unavailable or may not operate optimally.
  * **Web Beacons** (also called “tracking pixels”) are small graphic images, also known as “Internet tags” or “clear gifs” that are embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used for various purposes, such as to count the number of visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, or to verify how many articles or links were actually viewed.
  * **Embedded Scripts** are designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites. These scripts are temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server, or the server of a third party with whom we work. They are active only while you are connected to the Sites, and are deleted or deactivated thereafter.



Additional information about Tracking Technologies and your choices concerning their use are explained below in the [Analytics Section](https://web.archive.org/about-md-anderson/business-legal/legal-and-policy/site-policies/privacy-policy.html#policies-6) and under [Your Choices](https://web.archive.org/about-md-anderson/business-legal/legal-and-policy/site-policies/privacy-policy.html#policies-7). 

**_Information from Other Sources_  
**

We also may obtain information about you from other sources, such as other non-profit organizations, and combine that with information we collect about you. To the extent we combine such third-party sourced information with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Sites, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy statements or practices of third parties or on any other websites or online services that we do not control.
