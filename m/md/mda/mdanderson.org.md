**Privacy Policy**

This is how we handle the information we learn from you when you visit The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Web site (www.mdanderson.org). The information we receive depends on what you do during your visit. 

**Web Server**  
Our web server collects and stores the following general information about you: 

  * the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account); 
  * the date and time you access our service; 
  * the pages you visit; 
  * the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to us. 
  * the name and release number of web browser software you are using. 



This information is collected automatically and is not linked to your personal identity. It is used in an aggregate way to help us improve our Web site and make it more useful to you. This information may be shared with a third-party web analytics company. 

**Use of Cookies**  
Cookies are small files that many Web sites place on your hard drive that allow those Web sites to identify you. The use of cookies is a standard and common practice of many Web sites. For example, if you allow a Web site to remember your login name or password, the Web site places a cookie on your computer. We may place cookies on your computer to allow us to allow us to know when you are on our Web site during future visits. We may use cookies to measure web traffic, to offer you certain products or services, and to customize your visit. However, if you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your internet browser may permit you to do so. In many internet browsers, you can change the browser settings to warn you before accepting cookies or to block cookies. If you block cookies, you may not be able to use certain Web site features or functions, or this Web site may not operate in an optimal mode.

**Online Forms & Email Communication  
**We do not obtain personal information (e.g. name, address, e-mail address, etc.) about you when you visit the M. D. Anderson Web site unless you choose voluntarily to provide such information to us. 

If you identify yourself by sending an e-mail, by using a form like "Contact Us," or by registering to receive information from us, there are a few things you should know. 

  * Various people at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center may see the material you submit. 
  * We may enter the information you send into our electronic database, to share with our physicians, other health care professionals, researchers, or our Internet services staff. 
  * In other limited circumstances, including requests from legal authorities, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit. 



You should note that electronic mail and other Internet communications channels are not necessarily secure against interception. While we take precautions, such as encrypting communications where appropriate, if your communication is very sensitive, or includes information like your diagnosis or medical history, you might want to send it by postal mail instead.
