We may also provide information on our company and our products, and may also offer opportunities to apply for employment. We hope that you enjoy our site and will come back often to visit!

Please take a moment to review our policy in detail. To assist you, we offer this short summary.

**When do we collect personal information?** ****

We only collect personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, hobby or activity information, demographic information (age, gender, etc.), taste or preference information, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor. Visitors may choose to submit personal information to enter contests, to obtain information or submit a comment, to register for a loyalty program or chat room, or to place an order. We make a special effort to advise children to get parental permission before providing information or ordering anything on-line, and urge parents to supervise their children's on-line use. We may ask for age information from children so that we can provide age-relevant content and fulfill certain legal obligations; if we learn we are dealing with a _[young child](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602191405id_/http://www.mars.com/privacy/annex_english.asp)_ , we may ask for the e-mail address of a parent and make an effort to contact them to determine if the child has permission to provide information to us. We have special policies in place for _[young children](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602191405id_/http://www.mars.com/privacy/annex_english.asp)_. Unless you see a „ _[Special Note to Parents](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602191405id_/http://www.mars.com/privacy/np_english.html)_ “ link on our home page, we do not knowingly collect any personal information from _[young children](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602191405id_/http://www.mars.com/privacy/annex_english.asp)_ at this site.

Providing personal information is up to you, our visitor. We collect personally identifiable information to enter you in contests and notify you of results, to e-mail you with updates and news, to respond to your questions or comments, to register you for certain features, to provide personalized content, information, and/or to send out brochures and other information on our products or our company. We ask visitors providing e-mail addresses to let us know if they would like further information or updates from us or our site; only those who request it will receive follow-up e-mail or other communications from us. We may also ask if you would like to receive information about other products available from members of our family of companies. Only those who expressly ask to receive such information online will get it. We also offer visitors an "opt-out" option at any time they wish to cease receiving e-mails or other information from us.

As is customary in many businesses, we may purchase and use opt-in e-mail lists to contact potential customers. We will honor opt-out requests and ask those providing lists to give us assurances that e-mail contact information is provided only for those consumers who have expressed a desire to receive offers and information by e-mail.

Personal information is used solely by us, and our affiliates, agents or business partners who help make this site and its content and the products and services at this site, available to you in order to respond to your requests (like fulfilling online shopping orders or offering a sweepstakes or promotion), and to better serve you, consistent with this policy. In addition, we may occasionally ask you if we may share information with other trusted third parties. We will let you know at the time the information is collected if such third-party sharing is anticipated, will identify the types of businesses at the area of collection, will describe the information we will share (like your mail or e-mail address) and will only share data if you agree. We will share personal data only with those who have agreed to follow careful policies.

_What are cookies?_

“Cookies” are data files that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the site. These data files include information that allows our site to remember important information that will make your use of the site more efficient and useful to you. Our sites use cookies for a variety of purposes. We use cookie technology and IP addresses to obtain non-personal information from on-line visitors, and also to provide registered visitors with the best possible personalized on-line experience.

_How do we use cookies?_

Visitors to our sites use different web browsers and different computers. To make your visits as easy as possible with the technology you use, we automatically keep track of the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape) and operating system (e.g., Windows, Macintosh) used by a visitor, and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider. We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site; personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. This data tells us if more visitors prefer certain features or areas to others, which helps us keep our site fresh and interesting to the majority of our visitors. We also use cookies to help prevent ___[young children](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602191405id_/http://www.mars.com/privacy/annex_english.asp)_ from entering certain areas or features intended only for adults or older teens.

_How do we use cookies to personalize your expierence at our sites?_

Cookie technology helps us deliver content tailored to a visitor’s interests, and allows us to make ordering products, entering and participating in sweepstakes and contests, and offering other functions at our site easier for our visitors. Sites that offer online shopping use cookies to remember and process the items in your shopping cart. Where permitted, we may associate personal information with a cookie file in such instances.

_What if I don´t want cookies?_

If you don't want cookies, you can set your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or turn off all cookies through your browser (e.g., Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator). (Check your browser HELP menu to learn the correct way to change or update your cookies.)   **If you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some of the features noted above.**

_What are Web beacons and how do you use them?_

Some of our Web pages and e-mail updates may contain electronic images called Web beacons, sometimes known as one pixel GIFs, clear GIFs or pixel tags. On Web sites, these allow us to count visitors who have viewed our pages. In promotional e-mail messages/newsletters they allow us to count how many subscribers have read them. Web beacons allow us to develop statistical information about the activities and features that most interest our consumers for the purpose of providing more personalized content. They are not used to access personally identifiable information without your consent. 

**What about chat rooms, message boards, or other interactive forums?**

We may offer chat rooms, message or bulletin boards, or interactive areas where visitors may post comments or information for our visitors’ enjoyment. If there is a chat room, bulletin or message board, or other interactive areas where personal information may be posted at this site, be sure to check our chat room rules before entering, as you will be bound by them as well as our _[General Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602191405id_/http://www.mars.com/privacy/ld_english.html)_. Our chat room rules will establish age and other restrictions on participation, and outline requirements for obtaining parental consent for _[young children](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602191405id_/http://www.mars.com/privacy/annex_english.asp)_ where their participation is permitted. As you know, anything you post online is available for the world to see. We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to information you voluntarily post.

**Is credit card / transaction information secure?**

We care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to communicate with your browser software when you order from us online and thereby provide us with credit card or similar information. SSL is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept your credit card / transaction and order information that you send us when you submit your online order. Otherwise, the transmission of information to and from us is not encrypted or secure. We take precautions to safeguard your credit card data in our internal systems.

**What do you do to safeguard personal information?**

We have instituted safeguards to check that our internal procedures meet our high policy standards. We also use our best efforts to be sure that third parties who work with us as our agents to make this site and its contents available to you, and to fulfill your orders and requests, agree to protect personal information that they must access in order to serve our site and our visitors.

**What about links to other sites?**

We may offer links to other sites outside the Mars family of companies. However, we try to link only with sites that share our values. You should always check the privacy policy of any linked site to understand their information collection practices, including how they may use cookies. We are not responsible for the content or information collection policies of sites operated by other companies. If you visit another site, you should review their privacy and other policies.

We reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any legal investigation. 

**What should I do if I have questions, wish to access, update or delete information, or wish to opt out of receiving future communications?**
