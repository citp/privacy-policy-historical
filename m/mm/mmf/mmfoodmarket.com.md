# Privacy Policy

M&M reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes.

## General Philosophy

M&M Meat Shops Ltd. is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy identifies the ways we ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information are protected within our business, whether provided at our stores, paper based collections, electronic communications over the Internet or on the telephone. It also outlines what personal information M&M Meat Shops Ltd. may collect and how we use or restrict the use of your personal information. The objectives of our Policy are to inform you of our commitments and actions for the protection of personal information and the rules we use to govern when we collect, hold, use or disclose personal information and data.

The privacy of our customers, our employees and visitors to our web sites is of prime importance to us. We are committed, no matter what the circumstances, to protect your privacy and our integrity. Our Policy is designed to meet or exceed the requirements of Canadian Privacy law including the recently enacted Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act (PIPEDA) and the principles and standards set forth in the Canadian National Standard for the Protection of Personal Information. We are committed to a constant self-evaluation of our practices and procedures and responding to our customers' and our employees' needs.

PIPEDA came about primarily so that individuals could be assured of retaining their privacy while participating in some form of electronic business or commerce. But the Act also applies to all personal information, not just that which is housed within a computer system. Therefore, compliance to the Act helps put in place safeguards to protect your business information and personal data. While the original intention of the Act is to foster electronic commerce by ensuring the protection of personal information, other benefits derived from the implementation of such a policy promote an organization's reputation and help develop confidence with customers. Companies also are finding that organizational support amongst employees strengthens. Further, by implementing a Privacy Policy, companies can demonstrate a competitive advantage to their customers. Tomorrow's world will cherish the attribute of protection even more strongly. Organizations that demonstrate their support in protecting their customers' personal information will find increased growth as customer confidence expands.

Protection of employee information within the company is also of prime importance. By protecting employee data, a company can increase employee respect and loyalty. Increased morale and corporate confidence that employees feel are the direct results of solid and fair policies and procedures.

Our organization needs to continue to prepare itself to comply with the legislation. We have completed a readiness assessment, have developed a far more extensive Privacy Policy, have created Head Office and store level procedures and controls and have developed training programs for staff and management. In addition, we have created the new Ombudsperson position of Corporate Privacy Officer. Anyone may contact this individual to request access to their information, to put forth complaints and request solutions and to adjust personal information. It is this Officer who constantly reviews the practices and procedures to ensure compliance with the Policy and with legislation.

Our organization's Policy has been developed as a cooperative effort of several departments and of several areas of responsibility. These include information technology and computer security, communications and legal services.

## An Individual's Rights

The Act gives individuals the right to know why an organization collects, uses or discloses personal information about them. It also gives an individual the right to expect an organization to collect, protect, use or disclose personal information reasonably and appropriately and not to use the information for any other purposes without again obtaining consent. Individuals have the right to obtain access to their personal information, ask for clarification, and to complain to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada about how an organization handles their personal information.

## An Organization's Responsibilities 

An organization is responsible for the protection of personal information, the fair handling of it at all times within the organization and in dealings with third parties. These responsibilities are outlined in principles that an organization must follow including accountability, identification of purpose, obtaining consent, limits to collection, use disclosure and retention as well as accuracy, safeguards, openness, access and recourse..

The Act impacts personal information of our customers and our staff. It is imperative that a proper Privacy Policy, in conjunction with the right controls, procedures and training to support the policy, be established, maintained and communicated. It will be these activities that will protect the organization's reputation, encourage employee morale and support and foster customer relations.

## Privacy Principles

## Sharing of Information 

## MAX

The M&M MAX Program respects the privacy of its members and is committed to protecting the personal information it has about them. The sharing of information about members' preferences, in order to offer rewards, benefits and products under the program, is an important and reasonably expected part of any consumer loyalty program. M&M Meat Shops Ltd., its franchisees and its partners share some non-sensitive personal preference information about you from time to time, in order to offer and provide quality rewards and other goods and services to members efficiently. However, M&M Meat Shops Ltd. will not collect, use or disclose sensitive information about a member without that member's expressed written consent. Our foremost concern in this regard is our members' trust in our stewardship of their personal information.
