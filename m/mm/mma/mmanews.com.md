The following Privacy Policy discloses our personal information gathering and sharing practices with respect to our website located at www.MMANews.com (the “Website”). We will not sell, share or rent your personal information to others in ways other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third party for direct marketing purposes, please e-mail us by using our contact page. Please be advised, however, where California residents opt-out from permitting their personal information to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from the Company in accordance with the law.

Use of IP Address

We use your network (IP) address to help prevent security breaches on the site, block users submitting inappropriate content, diagnose problems with our server and to administer the services (“Services”) offered at the Website. We may use your IP address to verify your identity internally or with a third party, but we will never utilize it to send any IP-based advertising to you. Your IP address is recorded so that we can offer the best possible customer service to you at all times.

Cookies & Web Bugs

We currently employ cookie and web bug technology to associate certain Internet-related habits of visitors to the Website with information that we have in our database. Additionally, we may use other new and evolving sources of information gathering technology in the future (together, “Technology Information”). A “cookie” is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows us to identify you with corresponding data on file in our database or the database of a third-party service provider. Individuals that use the Website must accept cookies in order to access all of the features and functionality available through use of the Website. No personally identifiable information is gathered by the cookie. To find out more information about cookies, including how to disable them, please visit www.cookiecentral.com. A “web bug” consists of source code embedded in an html e-mail or web page that can be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information on that individual that resides in a database. Use of web bugs allows us to track certain websites that an individual may visit online. Web bugs are also used to assist in ascertaining the products and services that individuals are interested in and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. In addition to using web bugs on web pages, we also use web bugs in connection with e-mail messages sent to individuals listed in our database. By visiting the Website, you agree to allow us to share such Website usage with third parties. You may erase and/or disable web bug functionality by following the instructions contained in your browser.
