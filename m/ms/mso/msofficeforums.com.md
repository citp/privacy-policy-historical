# Microsoft Office Forums - FAQ: Board FAQ

**IP and other technical information**  
When a visitor requests or reads a page, no more information is collected than is typically collected by web sites. msofficeforums.com may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be published or used to track legitimate users. 

When a registered member creates a new post, the server confidentially stores related IP information.

**Cookies**  
The sites set a temporary session cookie on a visitor's computer whenever a forum page is visited. Readers who do not intend to log in or post may deny this cookie; it will be deleted at the end of the browser's session. More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in status. If one saves a user name or password in one's browser, that information will be saved for up to a certain amount of days, and this information will be resent to the server on every visit to a forum page. Members using a public machine who do not wish to show their username to future users of the machine should clear these cookies after use.

**Page history**  
All posts are generally retained forever, under certain circumstances, posts may be removed upon poster's requests, but there is no guarantee any permanent deletion will happen.

**User participation**  
User participation is limited to registered members. Data on user participation, such as the times at which users created or edited posts, are publicly available.

**Reading forums**  
No more information on users and other visitors reading pages is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites. Aside from the above raw log data collected for general purposes, page visits do not expose a visitor's identity publicly. Sampled raw log data may include the IP address of any user, but it is not reproduced publicly.
