**Information We Collect About You **  
We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

•  Information about your transactions with us or others;

•  Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency;

•  Information obtained when verifying the information you provide on an application or other forms, such as from your current or past employers or from other institutions where you conduct financial transactions.

**Information About You We Share**   
We may disclose information we collect about you under circumstances as permitted or required by law. These disclosures typically include information to process transactions on your behalf, conduct the operations of our credit union, follow your instructions as you authorize, or protect the security of our financial records. 

We are committed to providing you with competitive products and services to meet your financial needs, which necessitates that we share information about you with our affiliates **,** to complete your transactions and to provide you with certain financial opportunities. We have also entered into agreements with other companies that provide either services to us or additional financial products for you to consider. 

Under these agreements, we may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. To protect your  privacy, we require these companies to agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and we prohibit their use of this information other than to carry out the purposes for which it is disclosed.

If you terminate your membership with Michigan State University Federal Credit Union, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as permitted or required by law.

**Steps We Take to Protect Your Information**

We are not responsible for the content or availability of any linked third party websites or the privacy practices of such third parties. In addition, a link from our website to another does not indicate that MSU Federal Credit Union endorses the services or policies of such third party websites.

**Online Privacy **  
Our privacy policy is the same whether you are online or not. At our website, [www.msufcu.org](http://www.msufcu.org/), you may apply for membership, accounts, loans and services. You may also communicate with us via the secure "Contact Us" form. To protect information you provide us online, we use multiple levels of security. All applications, forms and ComputerLine transactions are submitted to us securely using the industry standard "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) encryption to secure your submission. MSUFCU uses 128-bit encryption and we use firewalls to secure your information. A firewall is a security measure that insulates the credit union's computer network from the World Wide Web. We analyze the traffic coming in and out of the firewall, which could indicate intrusion activity and computer viruses. MSUFCU contracts with a third-party technology specialist to try to penetrate our network and evaluate the security of our online applications and ComputerLine. MSUFCU has successfully passed each evaluation and is annually certified as a secure site.

**Protecting Children's Online Privacy **  
MSUFCU does not knowingly collect, nor is our web site designed or directed to use personal information from children under the age of 13 without containing verifiable consent from their parents. We do offer a GO teen program section of our web site that is designed for children age 13-18. In this section of our web site, children have access to information and other sites that are age appropriate such as Googleplex. Should a child choose to submit a financial question to "Ask Justin," we would only use that information to respond directly to that child, seek parental consent or provide parental notice. No information would be stored.
