                                     Privacy Policy
Overview
MSDSonline Inc. (“MSDSonline”) is serious about protecting your privacy and recognizes
that you care how information about you is used and shared. We appreciate your trust
that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice (this “Privacy Policy”) describes how
we may collect personal information about you, how we may use it, with whom we may
share it, what choices you have regarding it, and how we protect it. This Privacy Policy is
incorporated into and is a part of the Terms of Use of this MSDSonline Website
(www.MSDSonline.com, this “Site”) and we encourage you to become familiar with the
terms and conditions contained herein. By accessing and using this Site, you agree that
you have read and understand this Privacy Policy, and that you accept and consent to
the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy.
Changes to Privacy Policy
From time to time, MSDSonline may change its privacy practices because of changes in
relevant and applicable legal or regulatory requirements, the business or business
practices of MSDSonline, or in its attempts to better serve your needs. Notice of such
changes to our privacy practices will be given in the manner described in MSDSonline’s
Terms of Use for this Site and a revised Privacy Policy will be posted at this location.
What Information Do We Collect?
MSDSonline may collect various types of information from or about you. During the Site
registration process and the MSDSonline subscriber registration process, you supply us
with basic contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address
and company name), as well as billing information. This information is generally entered
into fields in the registration and subscription forms and enables you to take full
advantage of the products and services that we offer. Should you purchase any
MSDSonline subscription or services on or through the Site, the information that you
supplied during the registration process may be used to track details about those
purchases.
MSDSonline may also retain the content of and metadata regarding any correspondence
you may have with MSDSonline or its customer service representatives, regardless of the
mode of communication by which such correspondence was made. This information
helps MSDSonline to improve the Site and the materials, products and services that we
offer on the Site, and to more effectively and efficiently respond to both current and
future inquiries.
As with many other Web sites, the Web servers used to operate the MSDSonline Site
collect certain data pertaining to you and the equipment and communications method
that you use to access the Internet and the Site. Without combining these data with other
sources of information, they do not readily identify you. They do reveal such things as the
Internet protocol (“IP”) address assigned to your computer, pages you accessed on the
Site, or immediately prior to visiting the Site, and the length of time you spent at the Site.
This information is collected to, among other things; facilitate Site operation and system
administration,      to      generate        aggregate,       non-identifiable      statistical

information, and to improve content and content delivery with regard to the Site and the
materials, products and services that MSDSonline makes available on the Site.
MSDSonline uses “cookies” (small text files stored on your computer) to help track and
customize your access and use of the Site. Cookies store and retain information that helps
us recognize you when you return to the Site following a previous visit. Cookies may also
store any login or ID assigned to you by MSDSonline and the associated password, though
this information is stored in encrypted form. Most popular Internet browser packages
allow you to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies. However, setting your
browser to reject cookies may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site and the
materials, products and services that MSDSonline makes available on the Site.
How Do We Use The Information That We Collect?
In addition to the uses mentioned or described above, MSDSonline uses the information
that it collects from or about you to improve the materials, products and services that
MSDSonline makes available on the Site, to notify you of changes made to the Site or new
products made available on or through the Site, to evaluate your needs and customize
Site content delivered to you according to those needs, to facilitate the processing of any
purchases you make through the Site, to send you promotional material from MSDSonline
and some of our affiliates, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes of
MSDSonline. MSDSonline does not share information collected about you with third
parties, except with regard to certain special programs that we offer in connection with
some of our business associates, which may involve special promotions and/or pricing,
and in which you are participating. Should you register as a participant in one of those
programs, MSDSonline will acknowledge your registration and notify our applicable
business associate of your registration, thereby enabling you to receive the corresponding
program benefits. It is our policy not to sell lists containing personal information about
Site users, registrants or subscribers. MSDSonline may provide aggregate statistics about
our clients, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party
vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.
MSDSonline may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such
release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of
any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights of MSDSonline or another party.
What Choices Do You Have?
You may update at any time the information about you and your personal preferences
that is stored from your Site or subscriber registration. You may also ask us at any time to
correct any inaccuracies contained in your information or to remove your name from our
list of Site users who wish to receive electronic communications and e-mail
advertisements from MSDSonline and our affiliates by simply sending such a request to
us at the numbers or addresses given below. Once you opt-out, we will honor your choice
until you inform us otherwise. Please remember, however, that if we have already shared
information about you pursuant to your registration and participation in any special
programs of our business associates (as described above), we have no control over how
such business associates may further use that information and you will need to contact
them directly in that regard.

How Do We Protect Information Collected About You?
MSDSonline places a high value on protecting information transmitted via this Site. For
this reason, we use state-of-the-art security solutions, including VeriSign’s Site Trust 128
bit SSL encryption technology to process payments and to provide secure communication
methods. In addition, the Site is protected by a firewall that provides a high level of
security. MSDSonline takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect
customer-specific information transmitted via or stored on our Site. However, no security
system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that information users supply will be totally
secure.
Business Transfers
As MSDSonline continues to grow and develop its business, it is possible that its corporate
structure might change or that it might merge or otherwise combine with, or that
substantially all of its assets might be acquired by, another company. In any such
transactions, customer information generally is, will most probably be, and should be
expected to be one of the transferred business assets.
Linked Sites
For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on the Site that link to other Web
sites not under the control of MSDSonline. We are not responsible for and this Privacy
Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to seek
out and read the privacy policy of any Web site that you visit. In addition, when you
initiate a transaction on a Web site that our Site links to, even if you reached that site
through our Site, the information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes
subject to the privacy practices of the owner of that linked site. You should read their
privacy policies to understand how they use and protect personal information that they
collect. MSDSonline is not responsible for the privacy or information practices of its
suppliers or any third party Web sites.
