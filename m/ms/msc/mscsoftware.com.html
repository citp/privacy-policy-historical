    <td><p><u> What is a cookie?</u> Cookies were originally designed to help
        a web site identify a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save
        and remember any preferences that were set before. A cookie is a small
        string of text a web site sends to your browser. It can't retrieve any
        data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your
        E-mail address. Many web sites use cookies to enhance the user's visit;
        in general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize
        home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep
        track of selections in a "shopping cart." </p>
      <p><u>How do we use cookies?</u> We use transient or "session" cookies
        to track a registered user's session. A session cookie is a small file
        that contains information about a user that disappears when the user's
        browser is closed. Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is
        not stored on your hard drive. It is only stored in temporary memory
        and is erased once the browser is closed. Users who have registered memberships
        with any of the Engineering-e.com sites or subscribed to any applications
        will need to have their browser enabled to accept cookies in order to
        access sections of each Engineering-e.com site.</p>
