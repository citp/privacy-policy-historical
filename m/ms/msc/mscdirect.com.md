MSC Industrial Supply also provides customers' names, addresses and product purchase information to a third party service provider with whom MSC Industrial Supply contracts to profile customer purchasing behavior. This information is used to help MSC Industrial Supply improve its offerings. This third party service provider may also supply this information to third parties for a fee.

MSC Industrial Supply uses third party vendors to advertise on various other websites by providing these vendors with information users have given us (e.g., an email address) and information we collect about users who have previously visited our site (e.g., cookies). This means that we could advertise to previous visitors to our site who didn’t complete a task on our site (e.g., using the contact form to make an inquiry), or who have registered an account with us using an email address. These ads could be in the form of advertisements in search results, banner ads on third party websites, or in other forms. Of course, any information collected will be used in accordance with this Policy.

Finally, we may engage other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as maintaining the Site, providing services related to the Site, collecting information, sending and receiving electronic mail and other functions related to our business and services (collectively, "Site Vendors"). In order to provide these services, the Site Vendors may receive, or have access to, your personally identifiable information. We will only provide to Site Vendors, or otherwise make accessible, information reasonably necessary to perform their duties and we will take steps to obligate our Site Vendors to safeguard your personally identifiable information, and refrain from using it for any other purpose.

In addition to the transfers of personally identifiable information described above, in the event an MSC Industrial Supply business is purchased by a third party, the personally identifiable information possessed or used by that MSC Industrial Supply business will be transferred to the purchaser together with all the other assets purchased.
