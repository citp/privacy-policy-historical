We encourage you to [contact us](mailto:privacy@mscdirect.com) any time with questions or feedback.

security issues

Making sure our customers feel secure is a top priority at MSC. Although customers are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their user IDs and passwords, absolute security cannot always be guaranteed. MSC is committed to our customer's needs and is continually working toward setting and improving the security of our sites. MSCdirect.com uses a 128-bit SSL (secure socket layer) for the encryption of transactions on its web site. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be deciphered by anyone except the account holder. All sensitive information remains on our server and will never be transmitted for any reason. 

information use and sharing

The information that MSC collects is used primarily for improving the site, but it is also valuable when describing traffic patterns to vendors who are interested in knowing who is viewing their offerings. 

Customers may be selected to participate in one of our voluntary online surveys and MSC may periodically contact its online customers- via e-mail, direct mail, or telephone- to request feedback, clarify an order, describe new offerings, or provide information about upcoming events that may be of interest. 

opting out

At MSC, the choice is always in the hands of our customers. Our customers may have their information removed from third party and internal MSC distribution at any time by simply choosing to opt out. Customers may opt out using any of the following methods:
