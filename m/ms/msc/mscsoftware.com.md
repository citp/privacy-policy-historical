# MSC Software Online Privacy Statement

MSC.Software Corporation ("MSC.Software" or "Company") is committed to safeguarding your privacy while delivering a useful and enjoyable online experience that provides information, products and services that are most helpful to you. This MSC.Software Online Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement") applies to data collected by MSC.Software through its Web site and services. It does not apply to those MSC.Software sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.

The Web site [http://www.mscsoftware.com](http://www.mscsoftware.com/) is intended for use by MSC.Software's customers and other business partners. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about what kinds of information we may gather when you visit our site, how we may use the information, whether and when we may disclose it to third parties, and choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct the information.

By accessing or using our Web site, you agree to the terms of this MSC.Software Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not access or use this site.

**_Collection of Your Personal Information_**  
When you browse our Web site, your IP address is automatically logged in order to give us an idea of which parts of our Web site you visit and how long you stay there. Your IP address is not linked to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us and provided by your web browser, is the type of computer and operating system you use to access this Web site.

We may ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your postcode, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. When you place an order from this Web site or request a quote, you'll be asked for information including your name, work e-mail address, work phone number, credit card information and other personal identifying information necessary to fill your order or provide the quotation. We will set up an account for you, which you may access when you want to order or get a quote.

When you become a registered user, the registration page will request you to input certain information, such as: your name, email address, street address, and a password you select.

**_Use of Your Personal Information_**  
MSC.Software collects and uses your personal information to improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested. This may include providing you with more effective customer service, making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need to re-enter the same information repeatedly. When you submit your personal information to MSC.Software, you understand and agree that MSC.Software, its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which MSC.Software and its controlled affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States.

We obtain your permission to send you information about MSC.Software or our business partners. Where we collect contact information (for example, our user registration pages), we give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving certain information from our Company and/or our business partners, and to be removed from our mailing list. This includes the option to decline to receive such information from various MSC.Software sites. You may also contact us to inquire about these matters, or add or remove your name from our contact lists, by sending an email to [www@mscsoftware.com](mailto:www@mscsoftware.com).

The Company may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe it is necessary to comply with laws and legal process served on MSC.Software, protect and defend the rights or property of the Company, or act in emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of MSC.Software services or members of the public.

**_Sharing of Your Personal Information_**  
MSC.Software provides support services via telephone, e-mail and/or online through various local legal entities which are part of the MSC.Software group of companies (the “MSC.Software Group”), and are located in the following countries: Australia, Brazil ** _,_** Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, The Peoples' Republic of China, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom (“ **Local Affiliates** ”). Addresses for the Local Affiliates may be found on the MSC web site at <http://www.mscsoftware.com/locations/>.

While online, the user is personally identified generally by individual user name and password.  Support requests are collected and handled by the appropriate Local Affiliates. MSC.Software and its Local Affiliates save all information provided by the user relative to providing the contractual services, and may exchange the information collected within the MSC.Software Group. Such information will not be transferred to third par-ties which are not part of the MSC.Software Group.   However, upon request by your company (to be distinguished by other third parties as the “Superuser”), MSC.Software and/or its Local Affiliates may disclose and/or submit to the Superuser all of your requests and other information provided by you and other users of the Superuser in connection with providing the contractual and support services to the Superuser.  By using the support services provided by MSC.Software and/or its Local Affiliates you agree to the processing and use of your personal data as described above. You have the right to revoke your consent at any time without any restrictions by in-forming MSC.Software at MSC.Software Technical Support.

In addition, we do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties. We may send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people:

  * When we have your consent to share the information;
  * When we need to share the information with companies who work on behalf of MSC.Software for purposes of providing a product or service you have requested (and only for that purpose, unless we tell you differently);
  * To process your credit card payments for products or services, we securely transmit necessary information (account number, etc.) to an online payment processor service;
  * When we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes;
  * When we make reports to law enforcement, or as requested by a government agency conducting investigations or proceedings;
  * If we find that your conduct on our web sites violate any of our terms of use, or similar or other rules governing site usage, user conduct, or any of our other policies or usage guidelines regarding specific products or services;
  * If we must collect on debts; or
  * Where your communications to MSC.Software or other users suggests possible harm to others.



Except as described herein, we will not disclose your personal information outside of MSC.Software and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. MSC.Software may hire a third party to provide limited services on our behalf such as processing transactions or providing address verification software to confirm the address provided is a correct mailing address. Those companies are allowed to procure only the personal information needed to deliver the service, must keep confidential the information, and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

**_Accessing Your Personal Information_**  
You will be given access to your personal information online to view, correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information, and will be required to sign in with your credentials (e-mails address and password). You can access and update your profile by visiting our Web site at <https://gateway.mscsoftware.com/Users/UpdateProfile.aspx>.   If you have any questions in this regard, MSC.Software will respond to your request to access or delete personal information within 30 days.

**_Security_**  
MSC.Software is committed to securing your personal information. We have instituted Secure Socket Layer protocol ("SSL") to protect your Internet transactions. When you place orders or access your account information, we use the SSL to encrypt all your personal information, including sensitive information such as credit card numbers, so they cannot be read during Internet transmission. To confirm this, when you enter personal information during the registration or ordering processes, your browser will indicate that you have entered a secure page environment (look for a "lock" icon, and/or you will see that the URL has changed from "http:" to "https"). We use a secure licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. Your credit card information is sent directly to our credit card service and referenced by your order number. We don't store your credit card information on our web site.

As a further protection, we do not store passwords in plain text. We store passwords encrypted. When you return for authentication, we encrypt the entered password and compare that to what is stored in the database. Since a password is used to help protect your personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential and not share the information with anyone. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**_Use of Cookies_** _ **  
**_ Cookies are designed to help identify a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that were set before. A cookie is a small string of text transferred by a Web server to your browser. It cannot retrieve any data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address. Many Web sites use cookies to enhance the user's visit. In general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections in a "shopping cart."

We use transient or "session" cookies to track a registered user's session. A session cookie is a small file that contains information about a user that disappears when the user's browser is closed. Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is not stored on your hard drive. It is only stored in temporary memory and is erased once the browser is closed. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers will automatically accept cookies. If you chose to decline cookies, you may not be able to access or use other features of our Web site that depend on cookies.

We may use the information we get from cookies to evaluate and improve our Web site. We won't use the information transferred through cookies for promotion or marketing purposes, and it won't be shared with third parties. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

**_Links to Other Web Sites_**  
As a convenience to you, we sometimes provide links to other, non-MSC.Software Web sites. These sites are not under the control of MSC.Software, and the fact that MSC.Software provides such links is not an indication that we endorse or are liable for those sites or their content. This Privacy Statement does not cover those linked sites. If you provide information to those company sites, that information will be subject to their privacy policies.

We maintain a relationship with Nexstra, a third-party provider of instructional manuals for MSC.Software. When you access a Nexstra page from our Site, you are subject to their privacy policy terms. We also partner with a co-branded third-party vendor who handles on our behalf, electronic download software delivery service center features on the Site. Under the arrangement between MSC.Software and the third-party vendor, in order for us to provide this service, we have passed on to the third-party vendor your name, e-mail address, company and company location information.
