**_Transfer of your Personal Data to third countries_**

 ____

Your personal data may be transferred to a country outside of EU/EEA such as Canada (commercial organizations), New Zealand, Switzerland, and US (limited to the [Privacy Shield framework](https://ec.europa.eu/info/digital-economy-and-society/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en))] which offer similar level of protection as within the EU/EEA. The transfer is based on the legal basis outlined in _How we process your personal data_ and is for the purpose outlined in _How we process your personal data_. The transfer to these countries is based on the adequacy decision of the European Commission.

Your personal data may be transferred to a country outside of EU/EEA such as Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, UAE, United States, Venezuela, which may have a lower level of protection than within the EU/EEA. The transfer is based on the legal basis outlined in _How we process your personal data_ and is for the purpose outlined in _How we process your personal data_. When transferring personal data to these countries, MSC Software uses standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to ensure a sufficient level of protection of your personal data. The standard contractual clauses can be found via the following link: <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm>.]

**_What are your rights_?**  
You are entitled to know what personal data we are processing about you.

Limitation or deletion of your personal data may result in MSC Software not being able to fulfil its commitments to you. You also have the right to request data portability, where your personal data would be extracted in a machine-readable format and transferred to another controller. MSC Software may not always be obliged to comply with a request from you for deletion, restriction, objection or data portability. Additional circumstances such as exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by EU or Member State law or processing for establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims can justify further processing by MSC Software. MSC Software will assess the eligibility of your request and inform you about MSC Software's decision and reasoning.  Where you have given us your consent to process your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time and without justification. Where you withdraw your consent, certain personal data (only to the extent that it is absolutely required), will be retained on our "do not contact" list.
