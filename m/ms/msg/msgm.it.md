## What are cookies?

What are cookies? Cookies are small text-files that are memorized on the computer when a user visits a website. The text memorizes information that the website is able to read when it is accessed the second time. Some of these cookies are essential for a website to run correctly, while others are used to store information in a safe way, for instance, user names or language settings. The advantage of having cookies installed on your own pc is that you don’t need to re-enter the same authentication information every time you view a web page that you had viewed previously.
