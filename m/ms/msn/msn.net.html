				<p class="title">MSN Privacy Statement
					<br>
					<span class="li" style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">(last updated: January 2004)</span></p>
				<p>MSN is committed to protecting your privacy. This MSN Privacy Statement applies 
					to data collection and usage&nbsp;on MSN sites and services; it does not apply 
					to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services. Please read 
					the MSN Privacy Statement below and also any supplementary information at the 
					end of this statement for additional details about particular MSN sites and 
					services that you may use.</p>
				<p>MSN is a general audience web site, intended for users of all ages. Personal 
					information of all users is collected, used and disclosed as described in this 
					Privacy Statement. This Statement contains a section with specific details 
					regarding personal information collected from children. Click <a href="#CHILDREN">here</a>
					to read more.</p>
				<p>Other Microsoft services linked to from this Web site, <a href="http://www.passport.com/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033">
						.NET Passport</a>, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=21970">MapPoint</a>, 
					<a href="http://www.bcentral.com/help/policy/privacy.asp">bCentral</a> and <a href="http://windowsmedia.com/privacy/privacystatement.asp?">
						WindowsMedia.com</a> have their own privacy statements which can be viewed 
					by clicking on the links.</p>
				<p class="title">Collection of your Personal Information</p>
				<p>At some sites, MSN collects personal information, such as your e-mail address, 
					name, home or work address or telephone number. MSN may also collect 
					demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, 
					interests and favorites. Information collected by MSN may be combined with 
					information obtained from other Microsoft services and other companies.</p>
				<p>If you choose to sign up for a paid subscription service (such as MSN Internet 
					Access or MSN Extra Storage), we will collect additional personal information, 
					including your credit card number and billing address, in order to create a 
					Microsoft billing account.</p>
				<p>MSN uses .NET Passport to provide registration and sign-in services. If you 
					create a .NET Passport at MSN, you are simultaneously registering with MSN and 
					opening a .NET Passport account. All of the registration information you 
					provide will be stored by MSN, and some or all of that information will also be 
					stored by .NET Passport in your Passport profile. To learn more about the 
					Passport service, the information stored in the Passport profile, and how 
					Passport uses and helps protect your personal information, please read the <a href="http://www.passport.net/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033">
						.NET Passport Privacy Statement.</a></p>
				<p>Some MSN services, such as MSN Chat and MSN Groups, request that you create a 
					social nickname, which is the name you will be known by to others in those 
					public places. You may select a different social nickname at any time. You can 
					also choose to create an optional public profile, containing information about 
					yourself - such as your hobbies and interests. Any information you choose to 
					enter in your public profile will be visible to other users of MSN sites and 
					services; and when you interact with other users (for example, sending an MSN 
					Hotmail message to another MSN email account or interacting in an MSN Chat 
					room), a link to your public profile may be displayed. Please keep in mind that 
					if you disclose personal information through MSN Chats, MSN Groups, or other 
					public online forums, this information may be collected and used by others. MSN 
					cautions you against&nbsp;providing personal information to strangers online, 
					which they may use for illegal or harmful purposes.</p>
				<p>MSN keeps track of the pages our customers visit within MSN, in order to 
					determine what MSN sites and services are the most popular.</p>
				<p>MSN also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software. 
					This information may include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, 
					access times and referring Web site addresses.
				</p>
				<p>Certain MSN services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another 
					company. If you register for or use such services, both MSN and the other 
					company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded 
					services.</p>
				<p class="title">Use of your Personal Information</p>
				<p>MSN and its operational service partners collect and use your personal 
					information to operate MSN and deliver the services you have requested. These 
					services may include the display of customized content and advertising based 
					upon the information MSN has collected. MSN does not use or disclose sensitive 
					personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, 
					without your explicit consent.</p>
				<p>MSN also uses your personal information to inform you of other products or 
					services available from Microsoft and its affiliates. MSN may also contact you 
					via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of 
					potential new services that may be offered.</p>
				<p>MSN does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. MSN may, 
					from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a 
					particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your 
					personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not 
					transferred to the third party.
				</p>
				<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, 
					such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer 
					support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our 
					services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they 
					need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality 
					of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any 
					other purpose.</p>
				<p>MSN may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by 
					law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform 
					to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or 
					the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft, including 
					its MSN family of Web sites; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect 
					the personal safety of users of MSN services or members of the public.</p>
				<p>Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the 
					United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, 
					subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent 
					to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides 
					by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce 
					regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>
				<p class="title">Control of your Personal Information</p>
				<p>MSN offers its customers choices for the collection, use and sharing of personal 
					information. You may go to the <a href="http://privacy.msn.com/choice/default.asp">MSN 
						Communications Preferences</a> page to proactively make choices about the 
					use and sharing of your personal information. You may choose not to receive 
					marketing material from MSN or on behalf of external third party business 
					partners. You may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from MSN 
					by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. The 
					instructions explain how to stop receiving such e-mails.</p>
				<p>There are some MSN services, including MSN Internet Access and MSN Hotmail, that 
					send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues, product 
					surveys, new feature announcements and news about MSN products and services. 
					You will not be able to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered a 
					part of the service you have chosen.</p>
				<p>You may subscribe and unsubscribe to MSN Newsletters by going to <a href="http://newsletters.msn.com/">
						newsletters.msn.com</a>. In addition, each MSN newsletter you receive will 
					have instructions on how to unsubscribe prominently mentioned in it.</p>
				<p>You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You can view or make changes to the information in your .NET Passport profile 
						at <a href="http://memberservices.passport.net/">http://memberservices.passport.net/</a>.
					</li><li>
						If you have a billing account you can add to or update the information through 
						the Account Update area located at <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com">https://billing.microsoft.com</a>.
					</li><li>
						If you have created a public profile on MSN, you may also edit or delete 
						information in your public profile by going to <a href="http://members.msn.com/edit.msnw">http://members.msn.com/edit.msnw</a>.</li></ul>
				<p class="title">Security of your Personal Information</p>
				<p>MSN is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use 
					a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal 
					information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store 
					the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, 
					which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly 
					confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we 
					protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
					protocol.</p>
				<a name="CHILDREN"></a>
				<p class="title">Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</p>
				<p>MSN offers a special MSN Kids area that is specifically designed for children at <a href="http://kids.msn.com/">
						http://kids.msn.com/</a>. MSN Kids has a special <a href="http://g.msn.com/0PRKids/enus">
						privacy statement</a> that informs children and parents about the MSN Kids 
					area, describes the additional privacy protections provided in this area, and 
					provides children with tips on how to protect themselves online.</p>
				<p>The rest of MSN is intended for users of all ages. Children may visit these 
					general audience areas of MSN and provide personal information, which will be 
					collected, used and disclosed as described is this Privacy Statement. Some, but 
					not all, MSN sites require users to provide age information. For those users 
					who visit such sites and identify themselves as under 13, MSN uses Kids 
					Passport, a service of .NET Passport, to obtain consent from parents for the 
					collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information as 
					described in this Privacy Statement. If MSN changes this Privacy Statement in a 
					way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal 
					information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be 
					notified and MSN will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent. To 
					learn more about the Kids Passport service, please visit <a href="http://www.passport.net/">
						www.passport.net</a> and read the <a href="http://www.passport.net/Consumer/KidsPrivacyPolicy.asp">
						.NET Passport Kids Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
				<p><b>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use such general audience 
						communication services as MSN Chat, MSN Groups, MSN Messenger, or MSN Hotmail, 
						your child will be able to communicate with other users of all ages. Before 
						providing consent, please be aware that such services will give your child the 
						ability to disclose personal information (e.g. name, address, e-mail, phone 
						numbers) on his or her own.</b> We encourage you to talk with your children 
					about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. 
					You and your child can visit <a href="http://www.msn.staysafeonline.com/">MSN's 
						Stay Safe Online</a> site for additional information about using the 
					Internet safely.</p>
				<p>When an MSN service knows that a user is a child, it will not condition the 
					child's participation in an activity, such as a game or a prize drawing, on the 
					provision of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to 
					participate in that activity. Additionally, you have the right, subject to 
					verification that you are the child's parent, to change or revoke the consent 
					choices you have previously made for MSN services and to review or request the 
					deletion of your child's personal information. You may send such requests, or 
					any questions you have about MSN's practices with regard to personal 
					information about your child, by clicking <a href="mailto:MSNPrivacy@msn.com">here</a>
					to send e-mail or by sending postal mail to the address in the "Contact 
					Information" section of this Statement.</p>
				<p class="title">Use of Cookies</p>
				<p>MSN uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a 
					text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot 
					be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are 
					uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain 
					that issued the cookie to you.</p>
				<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to 
					save you time. For example, if you personalize MSN's pages, or register with 
					MSN sites or services, a cookie helps MSN to recall your specific information 
					on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal 
					information, such as billing addresses, preferred email address, and so on. 
					When you return to MSN, the information you previously provided can be 
					retrieved, so you can easily use the MSN features that you customized.</p>
				<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
					automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting 
					to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not 
					be able to fully experience the interactive features of the MSN services or Web 
					sites you visit.
				</p>
				<p class="title">Use of Web Beacons</p>
				<p>
					MSN Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes 
					called single-pixel gifs - that allow MSN to count users who have visited those 
					pages and to deliver co-branded services. MSN may include web beacons in 
					promotional e-mail messages or MSN Newsletters in order to count how many 
					messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
				<p>Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, 
					time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web 
					beacon resides. MSN Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by 
					third parties in order to compile aggregated statistics and&nbsp;to help 
					determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns. 
					MSN prohibits web beacons from being used to access your personal information.</p>
				<p class="title">Use of Third Party Ad Networks</p>
				<p>The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on MSN Web pages are 
					displayed by MSN.</p>
				<p>In addition, MSN allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad 
					networks, to display advertisements on MSN Web pages. Some of these ad networks 
					may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the ad 
					network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online 
					advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where 
					you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and 
					determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to 
					deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to 
					you. Microsoft does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be 
					placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.</p>
				<p>MSN maintains relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks 
					currently operating such as: Ad4Ever; AdCentric Online; Ad Dynamix;
					AdSolution; Avenue A; BlueStreak; BridgeTrack; 
					DoubleClick; efluxa; Enliven; Flycast; i33; 
					Mediaplex; PlanetActive; Pointroll; 
					Profero; Qksrv; RealMedia; RedAgency; TangoZebra; TargetGraph; 
					TrackStar; Travelworm; Unicast.&nbsp;Those ad networks that use persistent 
					cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more 
					information at the Web site of either the individual ad network or the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">
						Network Advertising Initiative</a>.</p>
				<p class="title">TRUSTe Certification</p>
				<p>MSN is a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, 
					non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust and confidence in the 
					Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because MSN wants 
					to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its 
					information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by 
					TRUSTe.</p>
				<p class="title">Enforcement of this Privacy Statement</p>
				<p>If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact MSN via <a href="mailto:MSNPrivacy@msn.com">
						e-mail</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your 
					inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe 
					at <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html">www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html</a>. 
					TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with MSN to resolve your concerns.</p>
				<p class="title">Changes to this Statement</p>
				<p>MSN will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect company and 
					customer feedback. When MSN posts changes to this Statement, you will see the 
					word "updated" next to the Privacy Statement link on the front page of MSN. If 
					there are material changes to this Statement or in how MSN will use your 
					personal information, MSN will prominently post such changes prior to 
					implementing the change. MSN encourages you to periodically review this 
					Statement to be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information.</p>
				<p class="title">Contact Information</p>
				<p>MSN welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Statement. If you believe that 
					MSN has not adhered to this Statement, please contact MSN by telephone, e-mail,

				<p class="title">MSN Internet Access Service</p>
				<p>When you create an MSN Internet Access account, you will be simultaneously 
					creating a .Net Passport for each user of the account, which will be used to 
					sign into the service. For more information about .NET Passport, visit <a href="http://www.passport.net/">
						http://www.passport.net</a> and read the <a href="http://www.passport.net/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033">
						.NET Passport Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
				<p>New users will receive welcome letters explaining the features provided by the 
					service. MSN Internet Access may contact you regarding the service, such as 
					changes in the service, technical issues or billing questions. You may also 
					receive periodic member letters to announce important service changes, new 
					features, technical issue updates and news about other Microsoft products and 
					services.</p>
				<p>You may access and update your information in your MSN Internet Access account 
					in the "Help and Support" area of MSN Internet Access at <a href="http://memberservices.msn.com/">
						memberservices.msn.com</a>. You may also contact MSN Internet Access 
					Customer Service to determine whether such information has been accurately 
					recorded, and, if not, to request correction of any inaccuracies. You can reach 
					a live interactive online support representative 24 hours a day, 7 days a week 
					at <a href="http://msn.webhelp.com/msn/">msn.webhelp.com/msn/</a>.</p>

				<a name="MSNMAIL"></a>
				<p class="title">MSN Hotmail</p>
				<p>Hotmail collects information during the registration process, including first 
					and last name, country, region or state, zip or postal code, time zone, gender, 
					birth date and occupation. You may update your registration information at any 
					time from within your Hotmail account by clicking the "Options" button on the 
					navigation bar, and then clicking on the "Personal" icon.
				</p>
				<p>When you create a Hotmail account, you will also simultaneously create a .NET 
					Passport, which you will use for signing in to your Hotmail account. If you 
					cancel this .NET Passport account, you will automatically cancel your Hotmail 
					account. For more information about .NET Passport, visit <a href="http://www.passport.net">
						http://www.passport.net</a> and read the <a href="http://www.passport.net/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033">
						.NET Passport Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
				<p>Your registration information is used to operate the site, for demographic 
					statistics, and to display appropriate individualized advertisements. New users 
					will receive a Hotmail welcome letter explaining the features provided by the 
					service. Hotmail may also send periodic member letters, from which you may not 
					unsubscribe without closing your account,&nbsp;to announce important service 
					changes, new features, technical issue updates and information about other 
					products and services.</p>
				<p>Hotmail is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or "spam." 
					Hotmail will not sell, lease or rent its member lists to any third parties. 
					While Microsoft continues to actively review and implement new technology, such 
					as expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that 
					will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using 
					tools such as the Inbox Protector and being cautious about the sharing of your 
					e-mail address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail 
					you receive. For more information on how to best use Hotmail's tools, please 
					contact <a href="mailto:abuse@hotmail.com">abuse@hotmail.com</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hotmail has a strict policy prohibiting the use of a Hotmail account to send 
					spam. To read more about this policy, go to <a href="http://privacy.msn.com/Anti-spam/">

				<a name="MSNPREM"></a>
				<p class="title">MSN Premium/ MSN Plus / MSN 9 Dial-Up</p>
				<p>When you sign up for MSN Premium/ MSN Plus or MSN 9 Dial-Up, we request 
					registration information including personal information such as name and 
					address, as well as demographic information such as occupation. Once 
					registered, MSN will recognize users on future visits. Through MSN 
					registration, you will also create a .NET Passport for each user, which will be 
					used for signing into the service. For more information about Passport and the 
					Passport services, go to <a href="http://www.passport.net/">http://www.passport.net</a>
					and read the <a href="http://www.passport.net/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033">
						.NET Passport Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
				<p>MSN will automatically check the version of MSN Premium/ MSN Plus&nbsp;or MSN 9 
					Dial-Up and components you are using (including your browser version) every 
					time you sign into the service in order to optimize performance. MSN may also 
					provide upgrades to such software that will be automatically installed&nbsp;on 
					your computer.</p>
				<p><b>MSN Parental Controls</b><br>
					MSN Premium/ MSN Plus&nbsp;and MSN 9 Dial-Up account managers can choose to set 
					up MSN Parental Controls for the people who use that account. The account 
					manager is the person who subscribes to MSN. Because it is typically a parent 
					enabling this feature for a child, the terms "parent" and "child" will be used 
					to describe this feature.</p>
				<p>E-mail notification: When a parent configures Parental Controls for a child, the 
					child will receive an e-mail message describing the service and notifying him 
					or her that Parental Controls have been set for the account.</p>
				<p>Online activity report: Parents can choose to enable online reporting for a 
					child who has Parental Controls set for his or her account. If this feature is 
					enabled, information about how a child uses the Internet will be stored 
					temporarily on the child's computer. This information is periodically sent to 
					the parent by e-mail from the child's account and is then deleted from the 
					child's computer.</p>
				<p>Contact lists: Parents may also choose to control the list of people that a 
					child can correspond with using MSN Mail or MSN Messenger. The list of contacts 
					specified for the child is stored on MSN servers so that the child will be 
					protected whenever and wherever he or she uses MSN Mail or Messenger. The list 
					of contacts can be edited by the parent or can be deleted by deleting the 
					child's account.</p>
				<p>Task requests: A child may request permission to complete a task that a parent 
					has blocked. For example, the child can request access to a blocked Web site or 
					for the ability to exchange e-mail messages with a new friend. MSN stores this 
					automated request for a brief period, allowing the parent to review, allow, or 
					deny the request from any computer using MSN Premium/ MSN Plus&nbsp;or MSN 9 
					Dial-Up.</p>
				<p><b>MSN Customer Experience Improvement Program</b><br>
					The MSN Customer Experience Improvement Program is an optional service in which 
					you can choose to participate. If you choose to participate, you allow 
					Microsoft to collect anonymous information about how you use Microsoft software 
					and services, as well as some information about your computer.</p>
				<p>MSN performs this service to help us identify trends and usage patterns and 
					improve Microsoft software and services. The Customer Experience Improvement 
					Program can be turned on or off at any time in MSN Premium/ MSN Plus or MSN9 Dial-Up  
					Software on the Privacy settings page.</p>
				<p>This trend and usage information includes anonymous information about how you 
					use the software. For example, this may include whether you clicked on a 
					particular button or menu item, how many email messages you sent with pictures, 
					or whether the dashboard is turned on or off.
				</p>
				<p>Please note your decision to participate in the Customer Experience Improvement 
					Program does not affect the collection of anonymous performance information 
					about the MSN software and service that Microsoft collects as an essential part 
					of providing you and all MSN customers a reliable, quality service. This 
					performance information may include, for example, how many times you attempt to 
					sign in or how long it takes on average to open the home page. All of this 
					information is anonymous and does not include any personal information</p>
				<p><b>Critical Performance Errors</b><br>
					You may occasionally see a message informing you of a critical performance 
					error in MSN Premium/ MSN Plus or MSN 9 Dial-Up. This message will ask you to 
					send data to MSN. If you agree, MSN Software will automatically collect and 
					send the data needed to help MSN determine what caused the error.
				</p>
				<p>Before you choose to send your data to MSN, you have the opportunity to review 
					that data. If you choose to send the data, in some cases your personal 
					information may also be sent to MSN. This personal information is deleted 
					before Microsoft reviews the error data you send.</p>
				<p><b>Import Wizard</b><br>
					MSN Premium/ MSN Plus&nbsp;and MSN 9 Dial-Up offers you the chance to import 
					some information from your computer such as your Favorites from Internet 
					Explorer, your e-mail messages from Outlook Express and your Address Book from 
					Outlook Express, for use in MSN. This data is imported only at your request and 
					for the sole purpose of giving you access to it from MSN.</p>
				<p><b>"Roaming"</b><br>
					MSN&nbsp;Premium/ MSN Plus or MSN 9 Dial-Up give you access to some of your MSN 
					settings and information&nbsp;even when you sign in to MSN on different 
					computers ("roaming").</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Address Book and Calendar: When you input calendar and address book data into 
					MSN Premium/ MSN Plus or MSN Dial-Up, this information will be stored by the 
					MSN Address Book and Calendar service to enable roaming and your ability to 
					share your calendar data with other users. See below for more information on 
					this service.
					</li><li>
					Favorites: MSN Plus/ MSN premium and MSN 9 Dial-Up collect and store your 
					favorite Web page addresses (URLs) in your Favorites list. Your Favorites list 
					is available to you anywhere you sign in to MSN account.
					</li><li>
					Sign-in picture: Your sign-in picture will show anywhere you sign in to your 
					MSN account. If you communicate using MSN Messenger, people on your contact 
					list who are also running MSN Premium/ MSN Plus or MSN 9 Dial-Up will be able 
					to see your sign-in picture when you are online.
					</li><li>
						Parental Controls: MSN stores parental control settings so that they will be 
						enforced anywhere a child signs in to MSN Premium; MSN Plus or MSN 9 Dial-Up, 
						even if the child uses a different computer.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>All of&nbsp;this information&nbsp;is stored on secure MSN servers. The sole 
					purpose of storing the information on the server is to provide you with the 
					convenience of having your settings and information&nbsp;available to you 
					anywhere, even if you use multiple computers. This information is not used by 
					MSN for any purpose other than to enable roaming.

				<p class="title">MSN Toolbar</p>
				<p>Each time you use MSN Search, including the MSN Toolbar, cookies may be placed 
					on your machine and MSN may collect your Internet IP address, the time and date 
					of your search terms, and your browser configuration. MSN may use this 
					information to customize your search results.</p>
				<p>While you have MSN Toolbar installed, please note that new versions of the MSN 
					Toolbar will automatically be installed on your computer. This keeps your 
					Toolbar up-to-date and lets you take advantage of new features as soon as they 
					are available.</p>
				<p>Toolbar users will be given a choice to participate in CEIP, Microsoft's 
					Customer Experience Improvement Program. If you participate, the MSN Toolbar 
					may track the websites you visit as well as your actions while reviewing MSN 
					Search results, all on an anonymous basis. Such actions may include which 
					results are visited and how much time is spent on a particular search results 
					page. None of this activity is traced back to you personally, even if you are 
					signed into your Passport, and is used solely to improve the MSN Search 
					experience for all MSN users.

				<p class="title">MSN Calendar and Address Book</p>
				<p>The MSN Calendar and Address Book stores contact information you enter there 
					about yourself and others including calendar appointments, email address, first 
					and last name, nickname, home address, work address, phone number, and 
					birthdate. You may view, edit, and share that information with your friends and

				<p>There are two ways your calendar data may be viewed by others:
				</p>
				<p>For 1-to-1 calendar sharing, with side by side appointment views, both you and 
					your friend must be a subscriber to an MSN service.</p>
				<p>In this case, your calendar is shared only with specific contacts, those 
					contacts must authenticate with a Microsoft Passport and you must give 
					permission to those contacts to view your calendar.</p>
				<p>For public calendar access, any person with access to the Internet may view your 
					calendar if you decide to "publish" your calendar to msn.com/calendar.

					Name, a "friendly" name that you choose, a phone number (optional), and the 
					list of "buddies" with whom you can send and receive instant messages and 
					similar information about those "buddies." No other company has access to your

					collect anonymous information about how you use our software and services, as 
					well as some information about your computer. All of this information is 
					anonymous and does not include any personal information.</p>

					Messenger service, the time it takes you to sign-in, error messages that you 
					might encounter as you use the service, whether each message reaches the

				<a name="MSNDIRECT"></a>
				<p class="title">MSN Direct</p>
				<p>The MSN Direct is a specialized wireless service that delivers personalized 
					information through the FM subcarrier radio network to enabled watches. All 
					information sent over the network is encrypted for security and each watch has 
					a unique ID to ensure that only your watch can display the content intended 
					specifically for you - such as your calendar or messages.</p>
				<p>Watches with MSN Direct are one-way information receiving devices. They do not 
					broadcast any information, such as your location, that could be received by MSN 
					or others. There are, however, two ways in which MSN Direct may collect 
					information about your general location.</p>
				<p>When you sign up for the service on the MSN Direct website, we will collect an 
					activation code that will be displayed on your watch. This code will identify 
					the radio tower from which your watch is receiving a signal. This information 
					indicates which metropolitan area you were in at time of sign-up.</p>
				<p>You can also provide, at the MSN Direct website, information about where you 
					live and where you commute. This location data allows us to send you relevant 
					information for your locale, such as traffic updates. In addition, you can also 
					provide your travel locations so that personalized information can be 
					temporarily re-routed to broadcast towers near you when you are away from home.
