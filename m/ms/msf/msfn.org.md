All users have their user name, country and date of inclusion listed in our User List. This list is only visible to other registered users. The e-mail icon allows users to send private messages between them, but neither the sender's or recipient's e-mail addresses are disclosed. If the user requires privacy, an option is available on My Profile to hide the user name from this list.
