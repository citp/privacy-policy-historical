As a general rule, your personal data will not be used for any other purpose than those for which they were voluntarily provided to us. Your personal data are shared or transferred to third parties if such sharing or transfer is authorised by you or required to achieve the purposes for which you have provided them to us. It means that we may share your personal data with service providers, who help assist us in fulfilling our purposes. Personal data may also be shared with third parties when required by law or by a court order. 

Your Personal Information may be used in the following ways:

  * If you have contacted us via the contact details provided on our Website, we will use the information you have provided, including your email address, to respond to your inquiry.
  * Any Personal Information you submit when applying for career opportunities will be used solely for recruitment purposes (including for identifying job applicants, evaluating applications, making hiring and employment decisions, and contacting you by phone or in writing).

    * statistical purposes; and
    * analyse our fundraising activity



###  How we use your data depends on why you’re providing it

_Surveys_

We use surveys to understand who visits our websites and how they use it, helping us to create better content for you and make our websites easier to use.  
We may ask for your email address if you’re happy to be involved in future surveys or testing. We’ll only use this to ask you to help us with these types of requests.

## 4\. Who has access to your data

### Trained staff

Your information is only accessible by trained staff. We regularly review who has access to your information. As a general rule, your personal data will only be accessible insofar as it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. For instance, the data you provide for donations will be accessible to our donations department, our fundraising and marketing team and to service providers, if any, for the purpose of processing your donation. We do comprehensive checks on any contractors before we work with them. We always put a contract in place that sets out how they manage the personal data they collect or have access to.

### Disclosure of information

We will never share your Personal Information with any other company or third party without your consent, except in the following circumstances (each as permitted by applicable law, in particular, with regard to a transfer out of the EEA, as applicable):

  * as set out in this Policy;
  * when we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a subpoena, in response to a court order or other legal obligation, or in response to a valid request from a law enforcement agency;
  * to protect the security or confidentiality of our records and systems;
  * in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights, or
  * in the event that we sell or transfer all, or any portion of, our business or assets (including in the event of any reorganisation, dissolution, spin-off, or liquidation) we reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information to the relevant acquirer, successor, purchaser or beneficiary, or any appropriate combination of them.



We operate globally and may have a need to transfer certain Personal Information to countries outside the EEA which do not provide an adequate level as required under EU data protection law. We use Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure that your Personal Information is adequately protected and your privacy respected in the case of such a transfer.

## 5\. How do we keep your information safe?

  * We use reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information and to store it securely. Our Website has a secure SSL certificate, a global standard security technology that enables encrypted communication between the web browser and the web server.
  * Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your Personal Information, but cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk.



## 6\. How long do we keep your information? 

We keep your information for as long as it’s necessary in connection with the purposes defined above in “How do we use your information?”.

If you request to receive no further contact from us, we'll keep only the basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future, for the duration allowed by the application legislation. 

## 7\. Our legal basis for processing personal data

Organisations need a lawful basis to collect and use personal data under data protection law. The law allows for six ways to process personal data (and additional ways for sensitive personal data). Three of these are relevant to the types of processing that MSF carries out: 

  * A person’s consent (eg to send you direct marketing by e-mail or SMS);
  * Processing that is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (eg to process a gift aid declaration); and 
  * Our legitimate interests (please see below for more information). 



Our legitimate interests may include:

  * **Charity Governance;** including delivery of our charitable purposes, statutory and financial reporting and other regulatory compliance purposes;
  * **Administration and operational management;** including responding to solicited enquires, providing information and services, research, events management, the administration of volunteers and employment and recruitment requirements.
