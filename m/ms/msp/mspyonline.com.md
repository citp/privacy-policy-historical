### AGGREGATE INFORMATION THAT IS AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED. COOKIES. LOG FILES. PIXEL TAGS

We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through our Website to enhance your experience on our Website by using tracking technologies as Cookies (please read Cookie Policy), Log Files and Pixel tags. 

As you navigate our Website(s) information that we automatically collect is information in "log files" about your device’s connection to the Internet, length of time spent on the Website, and the pages accessed during each visit to the Website. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Website, track user movement on the Website, and gather broad statistical information for aggregate use. 

Our Website use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Website, Cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Website where you have entered preference information before. Cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

Through the use of cookies, mSpy can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting. By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. 

The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our Website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of Cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of Cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.

If you do not wish to receive Cookies you may be able to refuse them by adjusting your browser settings to reject Cookies. If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services or support.

### SECURITY

When you register an account, you receive an email with indication of a private key, or you may download it from your account. This private key is used for encrypting your personal data and for restoring access to your data if you lose your password. 

Private key is stored on mSpy servers in encrypted way. In case of an active account the private key is stored for a period of an active account.

The period of this private key storage is 1 (one) day after you delete your account under your request. 

### ENCRYPTED DATA

We have put in place security hardware, software and software update and network scanning procedures designed to safeguard and secure the information (including personal data) under our control and follow generally accepted industry standards. We work with third party service providers and vendors that use encryption and authentication to maintain the confidentiality of your personal data. If stored, we house personal information on systems behind firewalls that are only accessible to limited personnel, who are under DPA. 

We store personal data of all our users in encrypted way. We use asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem RSA with key size is 4096 bit (further RSA) and symmetric-key algorithm AES with key size is 256 bit (further AES).

Asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem RSA (key size is 4096 bit) use public encryption key and private decryption key. The public encryption key is storing in database (DB) in open way. The private decryption key is storing in DB encrypted using AES 256 using key which consist from the user’s password and secret key. It cannot be decrypted without user’s password and secret key.

User’s credentials are user’s login is stored in DB. User’s password is not stored. We store only hash of the password generated by md5 hash function from user’s passwords. We generate public-private key pair for cryptosystem RSA during user’s sign up. This public-private key pair is unique for each user. The key pair is stored in DB encrypted using AES 256.

Login process: We use user’s password from login form for decrypting user’s original private key. 

Encryption data: We get opened data from devices using encrypted https protocol. We immediately start encryption process of the data on the server in the RAM without storing on server`s disks. We encrypted data using RSA using user’s public encryption key. 

The encrypted data is saved to mSpy servers.

Decryption: We get decrypted user’s private key. We decrypt user’s text data using user`s original private decryption key. We show this information to user.

### LEGAL MATTERS

mSpy considers your use of its Service to be private. However, we may disclose your personal information stored in your account and/or on mSpy servers and databases, in order to: 

(1) comply with the law or legal process served on us; 

(2) enforce and investigate potential violations of this Privacy Policy; including use of this Service to participate in, or facilitate activities that violate the law; 

(3) investigate potential fraudulent activities; or 

(4) protect the rights, property, or safety of mSpy, its employees, its customers or the public.

In the event of a change of control of mSpy (such as asset transfers through a merger, sale, assignment or liquidation of the business entity, or any of its properties, assets or equity) or, in the event of a direct or indirect sale of any of its publishing properties and/or its Website(s), personal data of users of the affected Website(s) in our possession will be transferred to the new owner/successor. You will be notified of any such transaction and have an ability to exercise your legal rights under GDPR. You may always change or delete your personal data or opt out by contacting us as provided below, or if the acquirer posts a new Privacy Policy with new contact information, you may change or delete your personal data or opt out by following any new instructions that are posted.

We may share Aggregate Information with third parties, including strategic partners, for marketing and promotional purposes under concluded data processing agreements, which secure the transfer and processing of personal data according to GDPR.

The controller may also transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a payment provider under DPA) personal data of a data subject for payment processing purpose, which is attributable to the controller and without which a user would not be able to purchase the Software and use mSpy Service. 

As we use third party technological services for the provision of Services, we may transfer your personal date internationally. Providers of such technological services may process personal data collected in the course of providing us their services as sub-processors only under DPA in accordance with GDPR.

In case there might be a risk of unauthorized disclosure of personal data the controller communicates the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay. However, as the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures, as encryption, and it was applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, the controller is not required to communicate the data subject.

However, the encryption is useless if the access password or other credentials are weakly protected and stored by data subject. In this case the controller is not responsible for personal data breach. 

In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the competent supervisory authority.
