We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users’ movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

### How long do we keep your information?

We hold on to information that you provide us for the period allowable by law where we have a justifiable business need to do so.  You can request the deletion of your personal data at any time and all requests will be honored in accordance with applicable laws.

### Sharing your information

We may share your personal information with third party vendors and other service providers as needed to carry out services on our behalf as necessary for the operation of the MSPCA’s website. This may include identifying and serving targeted advertisements, billing, marketing, data analytics support, order fulfillment, and payment processing.

To remove your name from mailing lists shared with other organizations, please email webeditor @mspca.org with your full name, mailing address and a sentence requesting removal from the MSPCA shared list.

### Marketing

The MSPCA-Angell uses remarketing to display ads across the internet, in particular on the Google Display Network and Facebook, based on what parts of our website you have viewed by placing a cookie on your web browser. This cookie does not in any way identify you or give access to your computer or mobile device. This use of remarketing allows us to tailor our messages to only display ads that are relevant to you. If you do not wish to see ads from the MSPCA-Angell, you can opt out by visiting [Google’s Ad settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) and/or [Facebook’s Ad settings](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen).

We may work with social media companies (primarily Facebook) to show you interest-based ads to you or to your friends through Facebook’s Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on you or your friends’ interactions with MSPCA-Angell. We do not share personal information about you with Facebook, but we share a hashed email address or phone number which allows Facebook to identify our advertising audience based on the information that Facebook collects from its users. If you do not want to receive interest-based ads on Facebook, you can adjust your ad preferences through your [Facebook settings](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen).
