  <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>
    <strong>Information  Collection and Use</strong><br>
    MSY Technology Pty. Ltd. &nbsp;is the sole owner of information collected on  this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any outside  parties, except as outlined in this policy. We collect information from our  customers to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information, such  as order confirmations and order status updates. Information collected includes  your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, e-mail  address, and payment information such as your credit card number. We also  require you to submit a username and password of your choice for your future  access to your account information. To safeguard that your user name and  password remain confidential, DO NOT share this information with anyone. If you  elect to receive our newsletter or special promotions, your contact information  will be used for the delivery of these items. <br>
  <strong>Registration</strong><br>
    In order to process your orders  placed on this website, you must first complete the registration form. During  registration, you will be required to provide your contact information, which  includes your name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address. This  information is used to provide you with important MSY services such as  automated order status updates via e-mail. <br>
  <strong>Order</strong><br>
    Most of the information collected in  the registration process will be used to process orders. During the order  process, you will have to provide financial information such as your credit  card number, expiration date, money order, wire transfer or check information.  This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. If we  have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information to get  in touch with you. To properly process your credit card information, we must  share your personal and financial information with the merchant bank for  authorization and approval. This process is protected by an enhanced security  system. See the Security section below for more details on security measures  and procedures. We do not share your personal and financial information with any  third parties, except those specified in the Sharing section of this policy. <br>
  <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
    We customize certain Web page  content based upon your browser type and other information provided by our  cookie. If you choose to reject the cookie, you can still browse our store but  will be unable to use the shopping cart to buy merchandise. The MSY shopping  cart cannot function without cookies enabled so that the necessary information  to process your order is retained. If you disable cookies, MSY will be unable  to accept your online order. We will not share any personally identifiable  information provided by this cookie with any third party. We will, however,  link data stored in cookies to the personally identifiable information you  submitted while on our site. This allows us to personalize your shopping  experience and discern user preferences to evoke subconscious feelings of  familiarity and assurance. </p>
