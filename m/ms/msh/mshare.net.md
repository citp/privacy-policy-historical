# Mindshare Privacy Policy

**Mindshare Privacy Policy** ****

**Mindshare Technologies, Inc.**

This policy statement discloses the information practices of **Mindshare Technologies, Inc**. (“Mindshare”) relating to our web sites and web/text surveys, reporting engines (collectively the “Sites”), phone surveys, data collection and any other methods of interacting with Mindshare.

Your privacy is important to you and to us.  We are committed to respecting your privacy.  The following policy was created in order to comply with both the Privacy Act (1974) and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and any other relevant legislation.  To the extent there is additional protection afforded to you pursuant to the law, which is not set forth herein, Mindshare agrees to take such measures to give full effect to such additional protection.  Mindshare respects the privacy of each individual with which it comes into contact.

**Mindshare’s Clients and how this relates to your privacy**

Mindshare acts as a SaaS Provider (“Software as a Service”) for companies conducting data collection activities via telephone, the Internet, text messaging, comment cards, mystery shopping, internal audits and other data collection methods.  Following collection, the information is analyzed and reported on.  These activities are primarily targeting customer and employee satisfaction issues, but may also include market, product, and service research, as well as other types of research.  Surveys and data collection may be hosted and accessible on Mindshare’s ASP Hosting site, or on our clients’ own hosting sites.  Reports are processed and printed each day that may provide our clients with your Personal Information for the purpose of improving their operations and/or contacting you to follow up on your service experience, and/or the information you provided.  Be aware that Mindshare’s Clients have full access to the data, and therefore bear full responsibility for usage of that data.  In such cases, please refer to the privacy policy of the Mindshare client who invited you to provide information and feedback.

**What is Personal Information?**

Personal Information is information about an identifiable individual.  It may include your full name, address, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, email address, demographic/classification information (e.g. education or age), and any other information that identifies who you are or would allow someone to contact you.  It also may include client program membership or loyalty numbers. Your contact information may be used as required to follow up on your feedback so you can be contacted by client employees or representatives.  Personal Information only becomes known toMindshare when you voluntarily provide it to us, or it is provided to Mindshare by the Mindshare client that invited you to take a survey.

**Collection and Use of Personal Information**

Mindshare believes in protecting your privacy.  We will not collect any Personal Information from you via phone, web, texting, data transfer, or any other method that you do not volunteer.  Participation in surveys or other data collection is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to respond and whether or not to disclose any requested information. We do not sell, share, or rent Personal Information to third parties without your consent, except in certain specific cases described below.

If you choose to take a survey, register, or submit personally identifiable information to us, you agree to the use of such information in accordance with this privacy policy.  If you have already submitted Personal Information and would like us to remove it from our records, or if you would like to know what Personal Information is held in our records, see the Contact section below.

**Telephone ANI Visibility**

When you dial a toll-free number in the United States, the party you are calling pays for the call.   The called party is able to identify your telephone number using a telephone network technology called Automatic Number Identification (ANI).  FCC rules limit parties that own toll-free numbers from distributing the telephone numbers identified through ANI and require telephone companies to inform customers that their telephone numbers are being transmitted to toll-free numbers in this way.   If you take a Mindshare telephone survey, both Mindshare and its clients may have access to your ANI, but, per FCC rules, will not distribute that telephone number further.

**IP Addresses and Cookies**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer the Sites.  Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.  Our Sites may use cookies to make sure you don't access the same survey repeatedly and to determine the browser the visitor uses so the Sites can be designed to work properly with the most common versions of different browsers.  If used, these cookies are not linked to any Personal Information.  If you reject cookies, you may still use the Sites; however, you may not be able to access all areas or features.

**Privacy Policies in Specific Circumstances**

**Using and Sharing Personal Information**

The following paragraphs describe in more detail how Mindshare may use your personal information in specific circumstances.  Depending on the specific interaction you have with Mindshare, one or more of the following may apply. 

**Assistance to Complete a Survey**

In certain circumstances a participant may require assistance from Mindshare to complete a survey.  If the survey is being administered by telephone, they may be required to leave a voice message.   If the survey is being administered online or by other text media, they may be asked to post a message to Mindshare using an e-form or e-mail.  Personal Information may be required.  In this case, the Personal Information will only be used to contact a participant for the intent of resolving their difficulty in accessing and completing a Survey.

**Promotional and Incentive Contests**

Mindshare or its clients may offer various promotions, incentives, or sweepstakes from time to time.  When entering a promotional contest, we, our client, or our client’s fulfillment vendor may ask for your name, date of birth, address (e-mail and/or residential) and phone number so that we may communicate with you in the event you are a winner.

**Contact Us**

Our Sites’ contact forms may request your name and contact information, potentially including telephone numbers.  To post a message to Mindshare using an e-form an e-mail address is also required.

**Opt-In**

For certain surveys and other opt-in services, Mindshare may collect profile (e.g. personal interests) and demographic information (e.g. household income, etc). This information will be used to communicate specific information to you based on the profile and demographic information you provide.  Some surveys and opt-in services offer visitors the option of participating in additional surveys or receiving information from Mindshare or from a Mindshare client or business partner.  Visitors must opt-in if they wish to participate or receive such information, and if they do, their Personal Information may be used by Mindshare and/or shared with a client of Mindshare or business partner for that purpose.

**Fulfilling your transaction request**

If you request something from a Mindshare web site, for example, a product or service, a whitepaper, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request.  To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, other parts of Mindshare and business partners involved in the fulfillment.  If you request information about our products or services, we may follow up with you in the future with additional information that we think may be of interest to you.  You will always have an opportunity to opt out of receiving such communications.  In connection with a transaction, we may also contact you for market research purposes. 

**Public Forums**

The Sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups available to its visitors.  Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Subscription Registration**

If you register for a subscription (e.g. to a newsletter or other communication) we will use the registration information that you submit to process your request.  We will keep this information in a database.  In addition, we may contact you about future publications and Mindshare services that may be of interest to you.  You will always have an opportunity to opt out of receiving such communications. 

**Disclosure of Aggregate Information**

Mindshare reserves the right to use non-personal customer and/or employee data in aggregate for the purposes of generating “norms” and industry benchmarks, etc.

**Job Applications**

If you submit a job application to Mindshare, we may use the Personal Information that you supply, such as your email address and phone number, to contact you about possible job openings.  We may also contact previous employers and references, unless you instruct us not to.

**Disclosures Required By Law**

Be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that Personal Information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.  This includes the investigation of network abuse or a violation of our terms of use or other published guidelines, or as a part of any actual or threatened legal proceedings or alternative dispute resolution proceedings either initiated by or against us.

**New Use of Personal Information**

Should Mindshare wish to use your Personal Information for a purpose not contemplated at the time of initial collection, such as additional services, products, or promotional offers that may be of interest to you, we will use your contact information, including your email address, to ask for your consent to use your Personal Information for the new purpose.

**Non-Personal Information**

Our phone systems and web servers do automatically recognize some non-personal information.  Specifically, when you visit Mindshare Sites, we collect information regarding: 

  * your Internet location (IP address) 
  * the software (and its configuration) you use to visit our site 
  * the dates and times you visit our site 
  * the pages you visit on our site, and 
  * other, non-personal information, which we use to analyze our web traffic and administer our servers.



**Links to Third-Party Sites**

The Sites contain links to third-party sites.  Neither Mindshare nor any of its affiliates are responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party Web sites.  Mindshare co-branded sites and content partner sites have privacy policies independent of Mindshare.  We do not control the privacy practices of those sites and therefore strongly encourage users to familiarize themselves with the privacy practices and customs of any web site controlled by a third party before disclosing any Personal Information on that site.    Mindshare may share aggregate information with co-branded and other related sites, however this aggregated information does not contain personally identifiable information.  This Privacy Policy extends only to data collected on pages hosted on the Mindshare servers.

**Security, Storage, and Retention of Information**

The Sites (including, but not limited to: websites, surveys, reporting applications, and data transfer applications), have reasonable security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and interception of information by third parties.  While we use every reasonable means to protect data that is within our control, Mindshare assumes no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of information transmitted over the Internet. 

All hosted environments meet the following physical security requirements - Single point of entry to main hosting areas; main access monitored with additional access for emergency purposes only; surveillance cameras in facility; access validation with biometric identity check; access only to persons on Mindshare-approved access list.  All hosted environments also meet the following electronic security conditions - login validation; creation of accounts only as verified by Mindshare or sub-contracted hosting provider; secure SSH (encrypted) connections to access servers; servers running behind secure firewall; intrusion detection systems.  Additionally, Mindshare has the capability to encrypt specific individual pieces of highly-sensitive information if needed.  All hosted data is backed up continuously, with multiple, redundant servers.  Systems are regularly checked and tested.

One of the options we offer to our clients is Secure Socket Layer (SSL).  For clients who implement our SSL option, we will not transmit Customer Information for the particular user interface that has the SSL over the public internet "in the clear", i.e., without it first being encrypted. 

Mindshare imposes strict internal controls over employees with access to Customer Information.  Such access is granted only on a need-to-know basis.

Mindshare will retain Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and your consent to such purposes(s) will remain valid after termination of our interaction with you. 

**Our Worldwide Practices**

Mindshare conducts business globally, with people, processes, and systems that cross borders.  Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your Personal Information, all over the world.  Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information.  In such countries, Mindshare will still handle information in the manner we describe here. 

**How to Correct or Update Your Personal Information**

If you need to correct or update your Personal Information registered with us, contact the privacy officer and use "personal profile update" as the subject of the message.  Please make sure to include your previously registered name, address, email address and phone number along with any new Personal Information in the body of the message.  Mindshare will record your Personal Information change in our web database and will make this change available to our proper business groups.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**
