# Mindshare Privacy Policy

**GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY**  
This Privacy Policy discloses the information practices of Mindshare Technologies, Inc. and its affiliate, Empathica Inc. (collectively “Mindshare”, “we”, or “us”) relating to our web sites and web/text surveys, reporting engines (collectively the “Sites”), phone surveys, data collection and any other methods of interacting with us. A separate privacy policy is set forth below for Mindshare’s GoRecommend program and application.

Your privacy is important to you and to us, and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy was created in order to comply with the Privacy Act (1974), the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and any other relevant legislation. To the extent there is additional protection afforded to you pursuant to the law, which is not set forth herein, we agree to take such measures to give full effect to such additional protection.

**Safe Harbor-Compliant Affirmative Commitment**  
Mindshare complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Mindshare has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor Frameworks, and to view Mindshare’s certification, please visit [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/)

**Mindshare’s Clients and How This Relates to Your Privacy**  
Mindshare is a software as a service (SaaS) provider for companies conducting data collection activities via telephone, the Internet, text messaging, comment cards, mystery shopping, internal audits and other data collection methods. Following collection, the information is analyzed and reported on. These activities are primarily targeting customer and employee satisfaction issues, but may also include market, product, and service research, as well as other types of research. Surveys and data collection may be hosted and accessible on Mindshare’s ASP Hosting site, or on our clients’ own hosting sites. Reports are processed and printed each day that may provide our clients with your Personal Information for the purpose of improving their operations and/or contacting you to follow up on your service experience, and/or the information you provided. Be aware that Mindshare’s clients have full access to the data, and therefore bear full responsibility for usage of that data. In such cases, please refer to the privacy policy of the Mindshare client who invited you to provide information and feedback.

**What is Personal Information?**  
Personal Information is information about an identifiable individual. It may include your full name, address, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, email address, demographic/classification information (e.g. education or age), and any other information that identifies who you are or would allow someone to contact you. It also may include client program membership or loyalty numbers. Your contact information may be used as required to follow up on your feedback so you can be contacted by client employees or representatives. Personal Information only becomes known to Mindshare when you voluntarily provide it to us, or it is provided to Mindshare by the Mindshare client that invited you to take a survey.

**Collection and Use of Personal Information**  
We will not collect any Personal Information from you that you do not volunteer. Participation in surveys or other data collection is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to respond and whether or not to disclose any requested information. We do not sell, share, or rent Personal Information to third parties unless you expressly agree to have Mindshare share your Personal Information as described below.

If you choose to take a survey, register, or submit personally identifiable information to us, you agree to the use of such information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you elect not to provide your Personal Information to us, you will be ineligible to participate in any incentive contest that is offered on the Sites. If you have already submitted Personal Information and would like us to remove it from our records, or if you would like to know what Personal Information is held in our records, see the Contact section below.

**Telephone ANI Visibility**  
When you dial a toll-free number in the United States, the party you are calling pays for the call. The called party is able to identify your telephone number using a telephone network technology called Automatic Number Identification (ANI). FCC rules limit parties that own toll-free numbers from distributing the telephone numbers identified through ANI and require telephone companies to inform customers that their telephone numbers are being transmitted to toll-free numbers in this way. If you take a Mindshare telephone survey, both Mindshare and its clients may have access to your ANI, but, per FCC rules, will not distribute that telephone number further.

**IP Addresses and Cookies**  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Sites. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. Our Sites may use cookies to make sure you don’t access the same survey repeatedly and to determine the browser the visitor uses so the Sites can be designed to work properly with the most common versions of different browsers. If used, these cookies are not linked to any Personal Information. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Sites; however, you may not be able to access all areas or features.

**PRIVACY POLICY IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES**

**Using and Sharing Personal Information**  
The following paragraphs describe in more detail how Mindshare may use your personal information in specific circumstances. Depending on the specific interaction you have with Mindshare, one or more of the following may apply.

If the survey is being administered online or by other text media, you may be asked to post a message to Mindshare using an e-form or e-mail. Personal Information may be required. In this case, the Personal Information will only be used to contact you for the intent of resolving their difficulty in accessing and completing a Survey.

**Promotional and Incentive Contests**

This information will be used to communicate specific information to you based on the profile and demographic information you provide. Some surveys and opt-in services offer visitors the option of participating in additional surveys or receiving information from Mindshare or from a Mindshare client or business partner. Visitors must opt-in if they wish to participate or receive such information, and if they do, their Personal Information may be used by Mindshare and/or shared with a client of Mindshare or business partner for that purpose.

Should Mindshare wish to use your Personal Information for a purpose not contemplated at the time of initial collection, such as additional services, products, or promotional offers that may be of interest to you, we will use your contact information, including your email address, to ask for your consent to use your Personal Information for the new purpose.

**Links to Third-Party Sites**  
The Sites contain links to third-party sites. Neither Mindshare nor any of its affiliates are responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party Web sites. Mindshare co-branded sites and content partner sites have privacy policies independent of Mindshare. We do not control the privacy practices of those sites and therefore strongly encourage users to familiarize themselves with the privacy practices and customs of any web site controlled by a third party before disclosing any Personal Information on that site. Mindshare may share aggregate information with co-branded and other related sites, however this aggregated information does not contain personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy extends only to data collected on pages hosted on the Mindshare servers.

**Security, Storage, and Retention of Information**  
The Sites (including, but not limited to: websites, surveys, reporting applications, and data transfer applications), have commercially reasonable security measures consistent with industry standards in place to protect against the loss, misuse and interception of information by third parties. Mindshare holds its physical hosting facilities to these same standards. Nevertheless, Mindshare assumes no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of information transmitted over the Internet.

Mindshare imposes strict internal controls over employees with access to Customer Information. Such access is granted only on a need-to-know basis.

Mindshare will retain Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and your consent to such purposes(s) will remain valid after termination of our interaction with you.

**Our Worldwide Practices**  
Mindshare conducts business globally, with people, processes, and systems that cross borders. Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your Personal Information, all over the world. Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries, Mindshare will still handle information in the manner we describe here.

**How to Correct or Update Your Personal Information**  
If you need to correct or update your Personal Information registered with us, contact the privacy officer and use “personal profile update” as the subject of the message. Please make sure to include your previously registered name, address, email address and phone number along with any new Personal Information in the body of the message.
