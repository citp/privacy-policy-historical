# MSI PRIVACY POLICY | MSI Global

This privacy policy details how we, Micro-Star Int’l Co., Ltd. ("MSI"), use the information you provide us, as well as the information we may collect based on your access or use of MSI Websites (collectively, "MSI Website(s)"). Your access or use of MSI Website and any services, software, or tools therein, including account, product, or events registration, or support services shall be deemed as your acceptance of the terms of this privacy policy.

##  ACCOUNT CREATION

When you first create a MSI account, you will be required to provide some information and data for registration purpose. We will create a unique identification number linking your account with the associated information. This account can then be used to sign in or sign out of MSI Websites. Furthermore, this account may be required by MSI to provide you with additional services such as notifications, support, and product after sales services

Some MSI services such as RMA services may be accessed from MSI Websites. In order to provide accurate and efficient RMA services, we may require you to provide additional personally identifiable information ("PID"), including your real name, shipping/home address, email, product serial number, and phone number. For clarification purpose, providing PID is a not mandatory requirement to setup a MSI Websites account. Unless you expressly provide us with your PID during account registration, we will not actively link your PID with your MSI Websites account. Nor will we aggregate your MSI Website account information with RMA services which stores our customer PID separately from MSI Websites.

You may also sign into the MSI Website using your Facebook or Google account. If you elect to do so, some of your social media account information will be collected and stored on our servers for verification purposes when signing into MSI Websites. Please note that we only store basic information to validate whether the social media account you provided is valid. We will not store any other data or activity from your social media account. You may disassociate your social media account from MSI Website accounts by contacting our online customer support for assistance.
