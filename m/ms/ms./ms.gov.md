If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other functions of Mississippi.gov.

If Personally Identifiable Information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.

Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records unless the record falls within the specific exemptions. See Section 25-61-1 and following of the Mississippi Code Annotated for the Mississippi Public Records Act.
