**Privacy and Personal Information**   


Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine by limiting the collection of personal information. For certain promotions, we may request a voluntary submission of information such as name, e-mail address, city, state, and age.

Such information will not be posted or published by us, nor will it be provided to third parties without prior written consent. 

Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical or market research purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's users are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.

This site, Merriam-Webster OnLine, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages.

This information is used for statistical and market research purposes only.
