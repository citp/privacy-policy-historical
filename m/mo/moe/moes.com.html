<h1>
	Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms<strong> </strong>
</h1>
<p>
	We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites, App and Services. We
	may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>
	<strong>.</strong>
	Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies
	allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your
	activities. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help
	portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to manage how websites place cookies through your browser.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies</em>
	. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard
	drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites and
	App to, among other things, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in
	HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Local Storage Objects</em></strong>
	. We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser
	cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web
	browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global
	Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Third-party Analytics</em></strong>
	<strong>. </strong>
	We use third party analytics tools, including, but not limited to, Google Analytics and ClickDimensions, to collect, monitor and analyze this information
in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors’ needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html?rd=2">Google</a> and	<a href="http://www.clickdimensions.com/about/privacy-policy">ClickDimensions</a>, each of which have their own privacy policy addressing how they such
	information and any choices you may have about their collection and use of information. We encourage you to review these privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Targeted</em></strong>
	<em> </em>
	<strong><em>Advertising</em></strong>
	<em> </em>
	<strong><em>and</em></strong>
	<em> </em>
	<strong><em>Ad</em></strong>
	<em> </em>
	<strong><em>Networks</em></strong>
	<strong>. </strong>
	We may send users targeted ads, based on their location and activities on our Sites and in the Apps. We may also participate in third party ad networks
	(including but not limited to <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">Google Ads</a> and Facebook Ads) and allow third parties to use
	cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies on the Sites to collect usage information and display targeted ads; these third parties may be able to
	associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources.
</p>
<p>
	We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Site and App, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third-party
	sites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to
	our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which
	you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web
	beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
	These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party
	advertisers with information about your usage of our Site, App, and Services.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Do-Not-Track</em>. </strong>
	Our Sites does not honor browser do-not-track requests. However, you can find information on how to opt out of many website participating ad networks at
the following sites: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, and	<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. Please note that opting out does not prevent all targeted ads from being
	displayed to you. Also, if you delete cookies after opting out, your opt out may no longer be effective. <strong></strong>
