<p>Thank you for visiting the Moe's Franchisor LLC's web site beadeadringer.com ("Site").  This privacy policy explains the policies implemented throughout Moe's Franchisor LLC (�Moe's�) governing Moe's use of personally identifiable information provided to Moe's via this Site.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
<p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Moe's may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If so, Moe's will post its updated Privacy Policy on this Site so that you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information.  Moe's encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.  Your continued use of this Site will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>What We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
<p>Generally, you may visit this Site without providing Moe's with any personally identifiable information.  We collect personally identifiable information about you only if you voluntarily provide it to us and you have the option not to provide any personally identifiable information to us.  You may voluntarily provide to us personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email, phone number and other contact information, when you contact  Moe's, enter a contest or sweepstakes, or subscribe to mailings or notices concerning Moe's or our products.   We may also collect other personally identifiable information that you choose to include in any communications that you send to us.  We may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your requests for information, to administer surveys, contests and sweepstakes, provide you with information and/or mailings or notices that you have requested, provide you with notices regarding products that may be of interest to you, and to improve the content and general administration of the Site.  If you request that Moe's send certain information or a greeting to a friend, we may ask you to submit your friend's email address and we will only use this email address to send the requested information or greeting.</p>

<p>We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.</p>

<p>The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses, computer and browser type, version and domain, dates and times of use of each page of our Site, and any third party Web site from which you transferred to link to this Site, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but this information will be in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information.  This aggregate information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.  We may use this aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and to improve our Site.</p>

<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<p>We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us.  For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to our Site hosting company who assists us in operating our Site or to a third party service provider to provide marketing or advertising on our behalf.  We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to prevent harm to yourself or others.  Additionally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information, in our sole discretion, to law enforcement agencies to assist in any investigation. In addition, we may transfer this information to a successor entity on a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Moe's participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Moe's assets related to this Site.  Any successor entity will be bound by the terms of this privacy policy.</p>

<h2>FOCUS Brands</h2>

As such, we may share your personally identifiable information with FOCUS Brands Inc. and its subsidiaries or affiliated entities ("Affiliated Entities") for purposes described above, as well as for sending you information about the programs of FOCUS Brands Inc. or its Affiliated Entities, and, occasionally, sending you advertising/promotional material from some of their advertising and strategic partners.  We likewise reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect to a third party in the event of any merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Moe's assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</p>

<h2>Children's Policy</h2>
<p>Moe's recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests.  No personally identifiable information is collected by Moe's from children under the age of 13 and this Site is not intended for children under the age of 13.  Moe's does not target its services or this Site to children under 13.  Moe's does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>A Special Note about Children who reside in the State of Maine, USA</h2>
<p>Moe's adheres with the Maine state law titled "An Act To Prevent Predatory Marketing Practices against Minors". The law applies to the collection and use of personal information for marketing purposes of children who are under the age of 18.  This Site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 18 years of age. It is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, we may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under 18 years of age. If this is the case, the parent or guardian of the minor must notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:custsvcs@moes.com">custsvcs@moes.com</a>. Once we have verified the accuracy of the information received by the parent or guardian regarding the child under 18 years of age, we will promptly delete the child's information from our servers.</p>

<h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
<p>This Site includes links to other Web sites on the Internet that are not under the control of or maintained by Moe's ("Third Party Sites").  These links do not constitute an endorsement by Moe's of these Third Party Sites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.  You acknowledge that Moe's is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and you agree that Moe's is not responsible for the content of Third Party Sites.  Your use of these Third Party Sites is subject to the respective terms of use and privacy policies located on the Third Party Sites.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice that are reasonably designed to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.</p>

<h2>Correction/Updating Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 15, 2010.</p>
					
                   <!-- 1/13/2010 <p>At Moe's, we like to joke and have a little fun. One visit to our restaurant tells you we're laid back, we like good food, and we like good music. Once you're here, you're a friend of Moe, and we take friendships seriously.</p>

<p>Internet privacy is of great concern to us. We take great pride in the fact that our customers like us so much, they want to hear from us from time to time to get product and store updates, invitations to great events, and even free stuff. How many restaurants can boast a similar relationship?</p>

<p>Because of this relationship, you can rest assured that your information won't be sold to a marketing, or any other, company. You will NOT be passed around on a list, you will only receive what you asked for: updates, invitations, and free stuff (well, not everyone gets free stuff).</p>

<p>If at any time you feel that your information has been compromised, you can unsubscribe from our list by clicking below. If you have questions regarding our list, send us an e-mail: <a href="mailto:contactus@focusbrands.com">contactus@focusbrands.com</a> - we're happy to answer you promptly.</p>-->
