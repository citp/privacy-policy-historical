It does not apply to information you might provide on another site operated by one of our partners or affiliates or other companies selling our products. 

Our information collection efforts are designed to improve the shopping experience of our customers and to provide customers relevant information about our products, services, and promotions.  By accessing this Site or other Moen Interfaces, you are consenting to the gathering of your information as detailed in this Privacy Policy as updated from time to time.
