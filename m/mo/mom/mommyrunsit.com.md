# Disclosure Policy - Mommy Runs It

…or Stuff You Should Know Before Reading This Blog

## 

First, a quick history lesson: In 2009, the FTC began requiring bloggers to disclose whenever they received payment or free products from advertisers or sponsors. Back before the FTC ruling, transparency was not required, which means that readers didn’t necessarily know whether a blogger genuinely loved a product or if their recommendation had been influenced by a sponsor or advertiser.

All of that changed in 2009, and again in 2013 when the guidelines were updated. Bloggers are now required to disclose their relationships with brands – this helps to eliminate the possibility of hidden interests or unspoken biases. In other words, it helps YOU, the reader, know that you’re getting the real deal from bloggers like me.

It means that I’m required by the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255 to tell you a bunch of stuff. I’ll list those things in detail for you here. You’ll probably notice some of them when you read my posts too.

It means that you will always know when I’ve earned money or received a free product via this blog. It means that you will be able to easily tell the difference between a paid advertisement and a product endorsement. And most importantly, it means that I will only recommend products or services that I believe in, use myself, and/or would recommend to my own mom.

Here’s what else it means.
