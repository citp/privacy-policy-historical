We use this information to help us better understand our audience, which in turn allows us to better meet your needs and interests.

### Online Contests

MoMA will occasionally offer visitors the opportunity to participate in online contests or sweepstakes. If you choose to enter, you will need to provide your name and e-mail address so that we may contact you in connection with the contest.

We may combine information you give to us online, in our stores or at the Museum or through our catalogs. We may also combine this information with publicly available information and information we received from or have cross-referenced with our third-party vendors and others. We use this combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about products or events that may be of interest to you, or for other promotional purposes.

### Use of Outside Vendors

MoMA may from time to time retain qualified third-party vendors in order to help us manage the MoMA Website and allow us to better serve our visitors and customers. These may include third-party vendors we engage to analyze the information we collect on the MoMA Website for marketing or similar purposes. MoMA requires its vendors to maintain the security of the information to which they are provided access and restricts the vendors from using the information in any way not expressly authorized by MoMA.

We may contract with third parties who use cookies to collect information on our behalf. These parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. If you would like to opt out of this use of your information, you can change the preferences of your browser so that it does not accept cookies. We may contract with companies or others to provide certain services, including credit card processing, data management, promotional services, etc. We provide these service providers with the information they need to perform these services, but we restrict the vendors from using the information in any way not expressly authorized by MoMA.
