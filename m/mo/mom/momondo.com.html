                <h3>Links to third party sites</h3>

                <p>momondo provides links to third party websites, e.g. after a search; and may provide referrals to certain third parties' products or services. If you choose to visit a third party's web site or use its products or services, please be aware that this privacy policy will not govern your activities and any information you disclose to such third party. We strongly encourage you to read the privacy policies of the third party web sites that you visit. We are not in any way responsible for the content of the sites that we provide links to.</p>

                <h3>Confidentiality and security</h3>

                <p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe have a legitimate need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. momondo employs procedural and technical measures reasonably designed to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure. While no website or app can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect your personal information. We also use encryption when transmitting personal information that is sensitive to you between your system and ours.</p>

                <h3>Community – Information sharing among momondo users</h3>

                <p>If you choose to include personally identifiable information in your comments, open text fields, or other areas of the web site or the apps intended for public viewing, other users will be able to view and use this information. We recommend against posting your email address and other personally identifiable information in this manner unless you are comfortable with the possibility of receiving unwanted contact.</p>

                <h3>Accessing, reviewing and changing your personal information</h3>

                <p>We will offer you the ability to access, review and change certain information via the registration page on the website or in the app. Upon your request, we will deactivate your profile, and remove your personal information from active service. Your profile will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity. We will retain in our files and databases some personal information to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of use and comply with legal requirements as permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your request.</p>

                <h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>

                <p>momondo may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the email address specified in your momondo profile or by placing a notice on our site.</p>
