## Use of cookies

The Website uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the Website pages, or register with the Website or services, a cookie helps the Website to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Website features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Website services or pages you visit.

This site uses Google Analytics remarketing codes and logs when users view specific pages or take specific actions on this website. This will allow the Website to provide customized advertisements across the internet based on your specific interests. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Website. If you do not wish to receive this type of advertisement from us in the future you can opt out using the [opt-out form provided by Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Security of your personal information

The Website secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. The Website secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

## Changes to this statement

The Website will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and user feedback. The Website encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how the Website is protecting your information.
