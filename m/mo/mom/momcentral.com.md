# Mom Central | Privacy Policy

[](http://www.momcentral.com/)

**PRIVACY POLICY**

We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the users of our sites. This privacy policy will advise you about how we protect your personal information, and about what choices you have concerning our use of such information. Please read this policy carefully. We may need to change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes on our sites. We will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to anyone. Please refer back to this policy regularly. 

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please send us an e-mail at [editors@momcentral.com](mailto:privacy@momcentral.com). 

**SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY**

This policy applies to your use of all of the sites and services owned or operated by Ideas Squared, Inc., and affiliated companies (collectively "Mom Central" or "we," "us," or "our"), including momcentral.com, parentcentral.com, dadcentral.com, mrmomcentral.com and any other site that we may own or operate in the future (collectively, the "Mom Central Sites"). Unless we say otherwise, all references to the Mom Central in this policy include all such sites. This policy does not apply to your use of unaffiliated sites to which any of the Mom Central only links. 

**PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION**

Mom Central may request Personal Identification Information from you in connection with your use of, or participation in, any features of our web site, www.momcentral.com, or any of our affiliate sites including www.dadcentral.com, www.parentcentral.com, and www.mrmomcentral.com, including but not limited to registrations, content submissions, chats, newgroups, forums, bulletin boards, postings, surveys, focus groups, discussion groups, give-aways, contests, sweepstakes, requests for information, personal data shared or stored on the site, your requests for free products or services or additional information, and in connection with other activities, services, or resources that we make available on our site. 

Your use of momcentral.com is a consent to the foregoing use of your Personal Identification Information by Mom Central. Mom Central also may share your Personal Identification Information with select companies and organizations for their own marketing and promotional use. While Mom Central seeks to share Personal Identification Information with companies that follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for the actions and policies of such third parties. 

**HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION**

Many of the ways in which you interact with momcentral.com allows us to learn more about you. We collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page to learn which features are the most popular. In those instances where we do collect Personal Identification Information, you have the option of choosing to reveal it to us or to one of the vendors in our Network. In the event of a complaint, we may also receive Personal Identification Information about you from other parties in our Network or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint. 

Momcentral.com may request Personal Identification Information from you in connection with your use of, or participation in, our contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for free products or services or additional information, and in connection with other activities, services or resources we make available on any of our sites. In all of these cases, we will collect personal identification information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. 

**HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION**

As a general practice, we do not sell your Personal Identification Information to third parties. For example, we do not sell your email addresses or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers. However, on particular pages where we ask for your Personal Identification Information, we may explicitly tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties, in which case those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. For example, before you submit answers to questions we ask in an advertiser-sponsored promotion, we will tell you that your answers will be shared with that advertiser. Similarly, if you tell us on our registration page that you want information from related sites or organizations, we will, using our discretion, make that information available to our corporate strategic partners. 

We use your information on an aggregated basis to do such things as operate our site, enhance our site, and sell and deliver advertising. We also use this data, both aggregated and personally identifiable, to enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will be of interest to you. We disclose aggregated information about our site to third parties. 

If you do provide us with Personal Information, we may use it to conduct the activities described above and for internal marketing and promotional purposes. On occasion, for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce a product or service that we think might be of interest to the users of our sites. If you do not want to receive our e-mails, or do not want us to use your personal information for any of our internal or other purposes, we will give you an opportunity to "opt-out" when our request for your personal information is made. You may "opt-out" at any time, even after you have provided personal information, by following the procedures set forth below at the end of this Privacy Policy. As a user of our site, you must recognize, however, that under certain circumstances, if you choose to "opt-out" you may not be eligible for certain benefits for which a name, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal identification information is needed. 

In some situations, we share your Personal Identification Information with third parties who provide services to our Network in order to enhance the functionality available to you as part of the Network, and to provide you with new products and services such as email and member pages. 

Note that some online activities you choose to do necessarily lead to disclosure of your Personal Identification Information to third parties, such as when you include your name and email address in a postcard or when you order merchandise. In these cases, again, your choice to disclose Personal Identification Information is voluntary. 

Momcentral.com reserves the right to offer you third party services and products based on the preferences that you identify during the registration process and based on your subsequent preferences; such offers may be provided to you by momcentral.com. 

Momcentral.com reserves the right to terminate your momcentral.com e-mail account if momcentral.com learns that you have provided momcentral.com with false or misleading registration information. 

**EXCEPTION TO PERMISSIBLE INFORMATION POLICY**

We have two exceptions to these policies: We will release specific information about you or your account to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as when there is a physical threat to you or others. Please note that if you give out personal information online -- for example, through a bulletin board or chat room -- that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users' privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.

The importance of security for all Personal Identification Information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us.

Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. 

**USE OF IP ADDRESS**

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Some services within Mom Central, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.
