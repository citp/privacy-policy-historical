                            <h1>Data privacy statement</h1>

<p>In this data privacy statement we, Motigo GmbH &amp; Co KG ("Motigo"), should like to explain to you how we process your personal data. We are very conscious of the importance of handling with care all personal data, which the user has passed to us and accordingly comply with all the relevant legal provisions for data protection. Our highest priority is that personal privacy should be protected. Therefore we comply with the legal provisions for data protection as a matter of course. </p>

<h4>Responsible authority/contact</h4>

<p>The responsible authority within the meaning of the data protection laws is:<br>
    Motigo GmbH &amp; Co KG, Rotdornweg 6, 52355 Düren, Germany.<br>
    Should you have questions or suggestions concerning data protection, do not hesitate to contact us at support@motigo.com.<br>
</p>

<h4>Meaning</h4>

<p>Personal data are all the information concerning personal and factual relationships of an identified or identifiable person. This includes, for example, information and details such as your name, address or other postal address, your telephone number and your e-mail address. </p>

<h4>Intended purposes</h4>

<p>We collect personal data only when you have provided us with them and only to the extent and for the purpose for which you sent them to us, e.g. as part of the registration process or to process the contractual relationship with our company. Therefore we use and store your personal data only when you have expressly given us your informed consent and only to the extent, to which you have given you express permission, for example in accordance with the contractual relationship with our company. These details are stored by us on a specially protected server in Germany, and all the information on your identity are collected together by us only when you have expressly provided them to us.</p>

<h4>Data protection</h4>

<p>We have put in place a comprehensive range of technical and organisational measures to protect your data against possible risks, such as unauthorised access or seizure, unauthorised cognisance, modification or distribution, as well as against loss, destruction or mis-use. In order to protect your personal data from unauthorised access by third parties, when the data are being transferred, we secure data transfers , where necessary by means of SSL encryption. This is a standardised encryption procedure for on-line services, in particular for the Web.</p>

<p>If a contractual relationship exists between “Motigo” media and the Internet user (for example in a request for a newsletter), “Motigo” media shall process and use the data collected from the user to fulfil its obligations towards the user, insofar as this is necessary for this purpose.
</p>

<p>“Motigo” media shall collect, process and use data for purposes going beyond the transaction and fulfilment of contractual relationships or relationships resembling contractual relationships, only where it has the express informed consent of the user and only to the extent permitted by this consent. Such purposes for the most part concern marketing and use the collected data inter alia as content for market research, customer acquisition, product information or developing the company's services.</p>

<p>“Motigo” media relies on the double opt-in solution: the user, who has given his informed consent to the use of his data for the stated purposes, confirms this consent in a second step. In this way “Motigo” media ensures that it is this user alone who is entering the data and who is releasing the data for use by “Motigo” media. In this way “Motigo” media respects the user's right to informational self-determination.</p>

The content of the social plug-in is transmitted directly to your browser by Facebook and linked by it into the website. Therefore, we have no influence on the extent of data collected by Facebook by means of the social plug-in and thus we can inform you only to the level of our state of knowledge: By virtue of the integration of the social plug-ins Facebook is notified that you have visited the relevant page on our website, even if you are not a registered user of Facebook and are not currently logged in to Facebook. This information, together with your IP address is transmitted from your browser to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there.

Furthermore it is possible to use add-ons for your browser to block the social plug-ins, such as Facebook Blocker, webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker<br>
</p>

<h4>Google+</h4>

<p>The +1 plug-in from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA is integrated into this website; it can be identified by the +1 symbol on a white or coloured background. If you access one of the pages of our website containing this plug-in, your browser constructs a direct link to the Google servers, whereupon the content of the plug-in is transmitted to your browser and integrated by this into the website. We have no influence on the scope of content of the data, which is collected by this Google plug-in.

<h4>Twitter</h4>

<p>This website uses the buttons of the Twitter service, operated by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. These plug-ins can be identified by means of expressions such as "twitter" or "tweet" and by the Twitter logo. They make it possible inter alia to share an article or a page from this website on Twitter. When a user accesses a website with this kind of button, his browser constructs a direct link with the Twitter servers. The content of the Twitter buttons is directly transmitted from Twitter to the user's browser. We have, therefore, no influence on the scope of the data collected by Twitter by means of this plug-in and thus can inform the user only based on the state of our knowledge. Thereafter log-on data , such as the IP address of the user , the previously accessed website etc. is transmitted. Further information on this can be found in the Twitter data privacy statement on twitter.com/privacy.</p>
<p>If “Motigo” media uses external servers or service providers to store user data, “Motigo” media ensures that these are under at least the same obligations as “Motigo” media itself.</p>
<p>“Motigo” media's employees are obliged to protect data secrecy and to observe data protection provisions. This obligation includes inter alia the fact that the employees may process and use the data only insofar as it is required as part of contractual relationships or relationships, which resemble contractual relationships or to the extent that the customer has given his informed consent to the use of his data for the respective purposes. Personal data, which are no longer needed on the part of “Motigo” media to fulfil the purposes of the contract and/or for which there is no (further) informed consent for further processing and use by “Motigo” media, are deleted in a manner, which excludes any possible mis-use.</p>
<p>“Motigo” also collects, processes and use personal data on behalf of contractual and cooperation partners (e.g. website operators, advertising customers, agencies) for example for the purpose of generating addresses for subscription to a newsletter, product information, order etc. If “Motigo” media collects data on the basis of such a mandate, the cooperation partner is clearly identifiable at any time.</p>
<p>The user can in this case assert his rights solely against “Motigo” media's cooperation partner.</p>
<p>If “Motigo” media collects data on behalf of cooperation partners and processes and uses these data, the cooperation partner is responsible for compliance with the provisions of data protection law. In this case “Motigo” media is not responsible to the user for compliance by the cooperation partner with the provisions of data protection law. No rights or duties of any kind whatsoever arise for “Motigo” media, arising from contracts or relationships resembling contracts, which the user has concluded with a cooperation partner. “Motigo” media may have no influence, either direct or indirect, on these contracts. In this case “Motigo” media is bound by directives as regards its cooperation partner.</p>
<p>Of course, “Motigo” media endeavours to work only with those cooperation partners, which comply in the same way as “Motigo” media with the principles concerning data protection law set out in this statement, or which at least guarantee the standards applicable by virtue of the EU Data Protection Directive.</p>
