### What This Privacy Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy pertains to the use of the Motionbox, Inc. (”Motionbox”) website at http://www.motionbox.com/ which also includes portions of the website that are co-branded or co-labeled with a third party name or brand (the “Motionbox Website” or the “Website”).

This Privacy Policy covers how Motionbox treats personal information that Motionbox collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.

Motionbox reserves the right to review all User Content (as defined in our Terms and Conditions) to verify quality and adherence to our Terms and Conditions. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to our Terms and Conditions. Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions. To the extent and provisions in the Privacy Policy conflict with the Terms and Conditions, the Terms and Conditions govern your use of this Website.

PLEASE NOTE THAT BY USING THE MOTIONBOX WEBSITE OR SERVICE, OR BY VISITING THE WEBSITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE.

### Privacy Settings

Motionbox allows users to upload and display User Content on the Motionbox Website and/or on other websites using the Motionbox “Embeddable Player.” You have a choice of assigning one of three privacy settings to each User Content you post. These include:

  * **Private**. User Content that you publish as “Private” (”Private User Content”) will be accessible to you and Motionbox personnel in connection with the operation and administration of the Website. You may also share your own Privacy User Content with individuals of your choice.
  * **Protected**. User Content that you publish as “Protected” (”Private User Content”) will be accessible to you and to users you designate as “Contacts” on Motionbox, and to Motionbox personnel in connection with the operation and administration of the Website. 
  * **Open Access**. User Content that you publish as “Open Access” (”Public User Content”) will be accessible to users of the Motionbox Website, whether or not they are registered Motionbox users and to all partners, affiliates, agents, designees, licensors, licensees or sublicensees (collectively, “Partners”). Furthermore, any Motionbox user can publish your Public User Content on a website other than the Motionbox Website, using the Embeddable Player. In addition, Public User Content may also be available for other Motionbox users to modify, copy, download, or combine with other User Content.



You understand and agree that while Motionbox enables you to control who may access your User Content, if you opt to publish your content or otherwise distribute it to other third parties you are making your submissions available to individuals in ways Motionbox cannot and does not control. If you do choose to share your information with third parties Motionbox is not responsible for use of your data by any such third party.

Consistent with its Terms and Conditions, Motionbox and its partners shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with or arising out of your decision to publish User Content as “Shared” or “Open Access” including without limitation decisions you may make to change how this User Content is published. You may later decide to change the access settings to the User Content you publish, but you should be aware that there may still be copies of the content available publicly which Motionbox cannot and does not control.

### Third Party Advertisers

Motionbox may work with and allow other companies (like Google), third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements within the Motionbox Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send the advertisements and links that appear on the Website directly to your web browser.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.

Motionbox may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at [privacy@motionbox.com](mailto:privacy@motionbox.com).

Due to the existing regulatory environment, Motionbox cannot ensure that all of your personally identifiable information and communications will remain private and will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy.
