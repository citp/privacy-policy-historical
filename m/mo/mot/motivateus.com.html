We will never sell or divulge  in any way any personally identifiable information to a third party without your prior consent, unless we are lawfully required to do so. We safeguard information about you according to established and commercially reasonable security standards and procedures. We take privacy and security matters very seriously; and it is important to us that you understand and are comfortable with our privacy standards. We want to make your experience on  our website as enjoyable and rewarding as possible.<br><br>

Motivating Moments LLC requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.<br><br>

By visiting, submitting or subscribing to a Motivating Moments web site you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, the practices of our Site, or your dealings with our Site, you can contact us through e-mail: helping@motivateus.com<br><br>

<b>What information of yours does the Motivating Moments collect &amp; How is it Used?</b><br><br>

Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable. <br><br>




Anonymous information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Motivating Moments LLC collects some information each time a visitor comes to our website. Motivating Moments LLC collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from att.com or aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to our website site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Windows platform). Motivating Moments LLC collects this user information for purposes of website monitoring, improvement, and targeted advertising. You do not have to register with the Motivating Moments LLC before we can collect this anonymous information.<br><br>

Personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above. Motivating Moments LLC collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of its Web site:<br><br>


<b>Log Files</b><br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.  The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.<br><br>

<b>Submission Forms</b><br>

Our Submission form on our website requests that you give us contact information including first name or initial, last name or initial, email address, demographic information (state/province, country) and profile data (age).<br><br>

Contact information we collect from our forms (such as your email address) is used to process your submission for publication requests. The contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding your submission(s).<br><br>

<b>Responses to Email Inquiries</b><br>

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Motivating Moments LLC, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.  Motivating Moments LLC does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.<br><br>

<b>Voluntary Customer Surveys</b><br>

We may periodically conduct both visitor and member surveys.

Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party.  Participation in our surveys is voluntary.<br><br>

We take the information we receive from individuals and members responding to our Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, geographic location, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.<br><br>

<b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b><br>

Motivating Moments LLC does use cookies to store information about visitors preferences, record user-specific information on which pages the user access or visit, customize Web page content based on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends via their browser. <br><br>
