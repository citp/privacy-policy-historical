Motivating Moments LLC respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Internet Site called Motivating Moments.  We have two web addresses that point to the same Motivating Moments website - www.motivateus.com and www.motivatingmoments.com.<br><br>

Protecting your privacy is of the utmost importance to us; and keeping your information secure is one of our top priorities. We will never sell or divulge  in any way any personally identifiable information to a third party without your prior consent, unless we are lawfully required to do so.

We want to make your experience on  our website as enjoyable and rewarding as possible.<br><br>

Motivating Moments LLC requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.<br><br>

By visiting, submitting or subscribing to Motivating Moments web site you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, the practices of our Site, or your dealings with our Site, you can contact us through e-mail: helping@motivateus.com<br><br>

Motivating Moments LLC<br>

<b>What information of yours does the Motivating Moments collect &amp; How is it Used?</b><br><br>

Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable. <br><br>




Anonymous information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Motivating Moments LLC collects some information each time a visitor comes to our website. Motivating Moments LLC collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from att.com or aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to our website site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Windows platform). Motivating Moments LLC collects this user information for purposes of website monitoring, improvement, and targeted advertising. You do not have to register with the Motivating Moments LLC before we can collect this anonymous information.<br><br>

Personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above. Motivating Moments LLC collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of its Web site:<br><br>

<!--<b>Registration Form - For Subscription Membership</b><br><br>

Our site's registration form for subscription to our archives requires members to give us contact information including name, address, email address, billing information, demographic information and profile data.<br><br>

You may choose how you would like to subscribe either on-line or off-line, with a few restrictions. <br><br>

On-line subscription membership is available for a yearly subscription. Members are asked to provide certain personal information including name, address, email address, billing information (such as a credit card, checking account or direct debit account number) during the registration process. We use a third party partner http://www.paypal.com PayPal to process all of our online billing. <br><br>

It is the Member's responsibility to insure that all information is up-to-date, always.  If you have changed your name or email address please contact us at helping@motivateus.com<br><br>


Off-line subscription, through conventional postal mail, is available on a yearly subscription basis. Money order or certified check are the only two methods of payment at this time.<br><br>

The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each User's account and may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Motivating Moments LLC.<br><br>

Personally identifiable information is never sold or leased to any third parties unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. With your permission, we may use your contact information to send you information about our company and what we're doing. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-out section below.<br><br>-->

<b>Log Files</b><br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.  The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.<br><br>

<b>Submission Forms</b><br>

Our Submission form on our website requests that you give us contact information including first name or initial, last name or initial, email address, demographic information (state/province, country) and profile data (age).<br><br>

Contact information we collect from our forms (such as your email address) is used to process your submission for publication requests. The contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding your submission(s).<br><br>

<b>Responses to Email Inquiries</b><br>

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Motivating Moments LLC, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.  Motivating Moments LLC does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.<br><br>

<b>Voluntary Customer Surveys</b><br>

We may periodically conduct both visitor and member surveys. We encourage our visitors and members to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party.  Participation in our surveys is voluntary.<br><br>

We take the information we receive from individuals and members responding to our Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, geographic location, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.<br><br>

<b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b><br>

Like many websites, Motivating Moments LLC uses "cookie" technology.  When you first connect to our site the cookie identifies you with a unique random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you.  The cookie helps us to understand which parts of the website are most popular, where our visitors are going and how long they stay there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on the site so we make the site better.  <!--If you are a Subscriber, we will use a cookie to save your settings.-->  These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your information.  Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-Motivating Moments LLC web sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies. <br><br>

We also use third party advertisements on Motivating Moments to support our site.  Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).<br><br>

<b>Choice/Opt-Out:</b><br>
You always have the option of removing your name from any email list to not receive future communications. To ensure immediate removal from any of our communications send us an email at
helping@motivateus.com with a copy of the undesired email attached to the request and state your wish to be removed from the mailing list.<br><br>

<b>Special Circumstances</b><br>
It is Motivating Moments LLC's policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors, submitters or members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.<br><br>

However, Motivating Moments LLC may disclose personal information about Visitors, submitters or members, or information regarding your use of the Web sites for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with Motivating Moments LLC's rights or property, other Motivating Moments LLC web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities, violating our Terms of Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the Website properly; or to protect Motivating Moments LLC and our members.<br><br>

The practices and policies for the URL: www.motivateus.com are the same as the practices and policies of the URL: www.motivatingmoments.com.<br><br>

<b>Security:</b><br>

Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Motivating Moments LLC cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.<br><br>

<b>Motivating Moments LLC Commitment to Children's Privacy</b><br>

Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us.  It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and all other applicable laws.  Please read our <a href="child-privacy.htm">Children's Privacy Policy</a>.<br><br>


We have Web pages designed especially for our younger users, primarily teens.  While we make every effort to ensure that these Web sites are fun and age-appropriate for our younger audience, we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision. Subscription to archived portion of the website for teens can be activated either on-line or off-line.<br><br>

If a child under the age of 13 wishes to submit a quote, story, or poem to our website, a parental permission form first has to be filled out and faxed to: 248-681-6401 att: Motivating Moments LLC.<br><br>
