<h3>Last Updated: 02/16/2007</h3><br>
<p>Thank you for your interest in Motive Interactive, Inc. (referred to herein as “Motive 
Interactive,” “we” or “us”) and our website located at http://new.motiveinteractive.com (the 
“Site”).  We are pleased to provide this privacy policy to inform you of our practices with respect 
to how we collect and use Personal Information (defined below) about visitors to the Site.  By 
using this Site, you consent to the following terms.</p>
<h3>What We Collect</h3>
<p>The data that we regularly collect about visitors to our Site (e.g., IP address, browser type, pages 
accessed, duration of visit, etc.) does not necessarily enable us to personally identify you, and 
that is not our intention.  We do collect personally identifiable information about you (“Personal 
Information”), including without limitation, your name, billing address, mailing address, email 
address, gender, how you like to receive email messages, age, interests, and credit card 
information (if needed to process an order placed by you), but only if you voluntarily provide it 
to us, for example, by registering, placing an order, participating in one of our programs and/or 
requesting information from us.  Further, if you communicate with us, we may keep all such 
correspondence as part of your user account. </p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>To facilitate your use of the Site, Motive Interactive uses “cookies.”  A cookie is a small amount 
of data that Motive Interactive’s servers transfer to your browser and that only Motive 
Interactive’s servers can read.  When you log onto the Site, the cookie file captures your 
username, unique session identifier number and other session data to enable you to traverse 
through this website’s various screens without having to authenticate yourself at each new 
screen.  Motive Interactive uses cookies to understand general information on site traffic trends 
such as most frequently visited pages.  If you do not wish to utilize cookies, you may disable or 
delete them from within your Internet browser application by accessing the security or privacy 
settings.  You may, however, be required to have cookies enabled to access certain portions of 
the Site or participate in our programs.</p> 
<h3>Use of Information</h3>

 <div id="privacy_bullets"><dl><dt><div class="und">General Uses</div>
Motive Interactive uses your Personal Information primarily to provide 
products and services that you have requested, to send promotional information, and to 
enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems.  Personal Information is 
also used to verify your authority to access the Site.  Motive Interactive may also use any 
information you have entered into the Site as reasonably necessary to administer or 
provide customer support for the Site.</dt>

<dt><div class="und">Promotional Uses</div>Motive Interactive may also store and use your Personal Information 
for our own mailing and database purposes, and to send you information related to your 
interest areas and from other pre-screened companies that have products that we believe 
may be of interest to you.  If you would like to opt-out of having your information used 
for marketing purposes by Motive Interactive, please see the “How to Opt-Out” section 
below for instructions on how to inform us of this choice.</dt>

<h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
<p>Motive Interactive uses certain third party vendors (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) to 
assist us in providing our products and services.  Motive Interactive may transfer your Personal 
Information to such vendors for their use as necessary to fulfill their contracts with Motive 
Interactive.  We may also disclose your Personal Information as we believe is reasonably 
necessary to comply with law, regulation or other governmental authority or to prevent harm to 
yourself or others.  Your Personal Information may also be disclosed upon a transfer or sale to 
another entity of all or substantially all of our stock or assets in the line of business to which this 
privacy policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization.  We may also disclose your 
Personal Information to third parties that we believe may be of interest to you for their own 
marketing purposes, including without limitation, bringing you select retail opportunities via 
direct mail, email  and telemarketing.  Motive Interactive may also use trusted third party 
business partners (“Partners”) to host short surveys or offer forms on the Motive Interactive Site 
and affiliated sites.  When you select an offer, we may pre-populate Personal Information in 
these forms to make it easier for you to get information about various special offers and services.  
If you agree to participate in an offer hosted by Motive Interactive or our Partners, your Personal 
Information included in the form will be transmitted to the appropriate advertiser referenced in 
the survey or offer.</p>

<h3>How to Opt-Out</h3>
<p>If you do not wish your information shared with third parties by Motive Interactive for marketing 
purposes, you may opt-out of such disclosure by notifying Motive Interactive using the contact 
information provided below.  Upon opting-out, Motive Interactive will not make further 
disclosures of your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes.  Please allow up 
to seven (7) business days to be completely opted-out from such use.  Keep in mind that if you 
take advantage of an offer from a Motive Interactive business partner, they may independently 
wish to send offers to you.  In the event that you wish to opt-out of receiving future offers from 
these third parties, you must contact them directly to make such a request.</p>

<h3>How You Can Change, Correct and Update Your Information</h3>
<p>You may change certain of your Personal Information we have on file for you at any time by 
visiting the Edit My Preferences page on the Site and making your desired changes. </p>
 
<h3>Links</h3>

certain third parties’ products or services.  If you choose to visit a third party’s website or use its 
products or services, please be aware that these third parties’ policies with respect to privacy, and 
not the Motive Interactive privacy policy, will govern your activities and any information you 
disclose while interacting with these third parties.  Motive Interactive does not bear any 
responsibility for any actions or policies of such third party websites, including those that are 
framed within the Site.</p>
