# MOTU.com - MOTU Privacy Policies and Terms of Use

FIRST: The only personal information we collect online is information you voluntarily provide to us!  
This information could include (for example) your name, a mailing address, email address, or phone number – it depends on what you’re asking MOTU to do for you. If you supply us with personal information on this website, you will only be contacted so that we can provide you with the information, products, or services you have requested. If you make a purchase, of course MOTU will collect (and hold) all the information mentioned above, plus such things as your credit card number and billing address. Occasionally – unless you ask us not to – we might send you extra information about MOTU and its products, that we believe you would find interesting. (Note: Our website is not directed at children, so MOTU does not knowingly collect or maintain any information from children under age 13.)

SECOND: When you browse MOTU’s web site, you do so without revealing your identity.  
MOTU’s web site uses cookies and your Internet Address only to present you with the proper information, and to keep your responses separate from other people using the web site. We also collect information about which pages people visit, so that we can update our website as necessary. MOTU does not disclose IP Address, Domain Name, nor even other aggregated information to others. We’ll hang onto this information to analyze it, and then throw it away. (You can, if you wish, delete or disable cookies in your web browser. Most of MOTU’s web site will still work, but some parts may not.)

THIRD: When you do give your information to us, we are committed to protecting its confidentiality.  
MOTU’s policies limit access to the personal information collected from this web site or via phone to employees of MOTU and its affiliates who need the information to fulfill their business responsibilities to you, and to us. Our employees and consultants are under strict confidentiality requirements. Vendors and other outside contractors we engage are subject to contractual or regulatory requirements safeguarding personal information.

BUT: Courts and law enforcement might override our policies.  
At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public safety, disclosure is necessary.

NOTE: MOTU’s web site may be linked to other web sites.  
MOTU often creates links to other web sites. Of course, MOTU is not responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by sites that are linked from or to our web site. As you visit pages and sites of different businesses, please be sure to review the privacy policies applicable to them. 

FINALLY:   
A long-time MOTU employee serves as our company-wide privacy officer, with responsibility for administering and implementing our Online Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or comments about MOTU’s Privacy Policy or the principles and procedures behind it, please put them in writing, to:
