### What are Cookies?

The use of Cookies and similar technologies has for some time been commonplace and cookies in particular are important in the provision of many online services.

### Cookie scope – Session Vs Persistent Cookies

Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.

_Session cookies_  – Allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around a site. They could also be used for security when a user is accessing internet banking or to facilitate use of webmail. These session cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored long term. For this reason, session cookies may sometimes be considered less privacy intrusive than persistent cookies.

_Persistent cookies_  – Are stored on a user’s device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering a user’s preferences and choices when using a site or to target advertising.

### Cookie Sources – First Vs Third Party

Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie.

First party cookies in basic terms are cookies set by a website visited by the user – the website displayed in the URL window.

Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website this would be a third party cookie.
