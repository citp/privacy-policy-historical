        This privacy statement covers the website www.Motovy.com (the "Site") and is applicable to all information about you ("you") collected through the
        Site.

    <p>

    <p>
        Motovy ("Motovy", "we", "us" or "our") discloses the information collection and usage practices applicable to the Site in this Policy. This Policy
        describes the types of information that we gather from you and the other people who visit the Site (the "Users") and how we may use that information.
        By providing any information, you agree to our use of that information consistent with this Policy.
        </p><p>
        </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect personally identifiable information from our Users at several different points on our Site. When this Privacy Policy uses the term
        "personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address,
        e-mail address, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product preferences, or number of children, is directly
        associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this
        Privacy Policy.
        </p><p>
        </p>

        We provide a service that helps people obtain price quotes for used or new vehicles and/or request quotes for vehicle financing and insurance. In order
        to perform that service, we need to collect and distribute personally identifiable information. We are committed to the responsible handling of any
        personal information you provide to us. This means we will use it only as outlined below. Users are welcome to browse our Site; however, in order to
        participate in some of our services, Users will be required to complete brief registration forms. These forms may or may not ask for personally
        identifiable information. When personally identifiable information is collected, it is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Information entered
        by Users may be transmitted to our trusted business partners who fulfill the services requested by those Users.

        <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>
        </p><p>
        </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        All Users have the option of providing various types of personally identifiable information to us through the Site. For example, you may choose to
        provide us your personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address,
        potential trade-in vehicles, employer and employment status, credit history, residence information, bankruptcy status, date of birth, household income
        and availability of a cosigner for a loan. We collect this personally identifiable information when you, at any point, manually enter it into any
        online form available on the Site. We may also store your personally identifiable information in our systems for use in other ways as described in this
        Policy.
        </p><p>
        </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In order for you to take full advantage of the Site, we encourage you to provide your personally identifiable information to us. Providing your
        personally identifiable information, however, is completely voluntary. You may choose not to provide us with your personally identifiable information
        by simply not entering it on the Site. While you will still have access to the Site even if you do not provide us with your personally identifiable
        information, you should understand that you will not be able to use certain of the services or features available through the Site that require you to
        enter your personally identifiable information in order to function.
        </p><p>
        </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not input any of your personally identifiable information, then the information we collect from you is limited. For example, we log your IP
        address in order to help us to diagnose problems with our servers, administer the Site and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time
        you visit, or it may be the same, depending on whether you access the Site through an always-on type of Internet connection (such as cable or DSL), or
        through a dial-up connection. Either way, it would be very difficult for us to personally identify you through your IP address. We match IP addresses
        to completed User registration forms for validation and error checking purposes. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or ad from another
        website, then we may also log that information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure and to understand the interests of our Users. In
        general, this information is used to generate overall anonymous reports on our Users that enable us to improve the effectiveness of the Site.

        When you visit the Site, we often send one or more small files known as "cookies" to your computer. A cookie may contain information that allows us to
        track your path through the Site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you provide us with personally identifiable
        information, the cookies will not contain any information that would allow us to personally identify you. If you do provide personally identifiable
        information to us, the cookie is tied to this information so that our systems will recognize you each time you visit the Site. In that way, we can save
        your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized version of the Site, without requiring you to log into the Site every time you
        visit. Our cookies cannot be used to read any other data from your computer and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other
        sites. We use cookies to help us understand how Users use the Site, and to help us to improve the Site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by
        following the procedures for rejecting cookies specific to your web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely
        when visiting not only our Site, but other websites as well.

        If you visit the website of one of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) by clicking on a link from our Site, they may also use cookies on their
        website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Motovy only and does not cover the use
        of cookies by any advertisers or other websites.

    </p>
    <p>
        We employ software technology that enables us to track certain aspects of a User's visit to the Site. This technology helps us better manage content on
        the Site by informing us what content is effective. The software uses two methods to track User activity: 1) "trackers" and 2) "clear gifs". Trackers
        are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how
        long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers, which are embedded in web pages and e-mail messages that track whether
        or not a User has viewed a particular web page or e-mail message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a
        User's session, such as IP Address and the type of browser used, and personally identifiable information, if provided by the User.
        </p><p>
        </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you arrive at the Site by "clicking through" from another website, and you have registered with that other website, then certain information about
        you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching on that led you to the Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use
        it. You should review the privacy policy of any website from which you reached the Site in order to determine what information was collected by that
        website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information. We may or may not retain information about you provided to us by
        other websites. If we do, we will only use it in accordance with this Policy. Such information may or may not be associated with other User activity
        data or personally identifiable information.

        Motovy operates a service that helps Users obtain price quotes for used or new vehicles and/or request quotes for vehicle financing and insurance. If
        you have been matched by our service to one of our partners, we need you to voluntarily provide your name, address, phone number and email address in
        order for us to introduce you to such partner. We will provide your information to each partner to whom we are introducing you. Any information

        Motovy may contract with third parties to provide various services to Motovy relating to the Site on an outsourced basis. For example, we may contract
        with an e-mail provider to handle the distribution of e-mail messages to Users of the Site. We may contract with a website hosting provider to host the
        Site for us. We may also contract with various validation services to confirm contact information that you provide. By visiting the Site, all Users
        consent to Motovy providing all information (whether or not personally identifiable) received or collected from those Users to such third party
        providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to us. In addition, all Users consent to the
        collection, maintenance, and processing of their information (whether or not personally identifiable) by Motovy and these third party providers.

        Site, we may also supplement your information (whether or not personally identifiable) with information from third party sources with whom we have
        contracted for the purpose of verifying the contact information you have provided. You have the option not to have your information shared with
        business partners by not requesting these services.

        From time-to-time our Site may request personally identifiable information from Users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or
        contests is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information. The requested
        information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact
        information will be shared with the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of
        monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Site. Users' personally identifiable information collected through surveys or contests is not
        shared with third parties who are not agents, service providers or business partners, unless we give prior notice and receive your permission for the
        sharing. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, these intermediaries will not use the Users' personally identifiable
        information for any secondary purposes.

        personally identifiable information) in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We
        don't expect this to happen, but if it does, we will provide only the information required. We can also turn over information about you if we believe
        we must do so in order to prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting this Policy, you consent to our right to do so, in our sole discretion. You
        also consent to our disclosing information about you in the course of legal proceedings if we believe we are legally required to do so, if we
        reasonably believe that doing so may mitigate our liability, or if doing so will assist us:

        At some point, Motovy may establish subsidiaries or other related companies, or merge with or be acquired by another company. When that happens, then
        we may disclose to them your personally identifiable information, in which case we will request them to abide by this Policy. We may also disclose some
        personally identifiable information to a potential acquirer, although such disclosure would be subject to normal and customary requirements.

        If we make a material change to this Policy, we will post a notice on the home page regarding the amended Policy, so that you are aware of what
        personally identifiable information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify
        this Policy at any time, so please review the Site frequently for any changes. Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Site and will be
        effective when posted. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted, the changes to any
        amended or revised Policy by your continued use of our services or the Site.

        Of course, Motovy will take reasonable measures to secure the personally identifiable information Users provide to us, using industry-standard methods.
        All personally identifiable information is protected by password and accessible only to authorized Motovy personnel. However, there is a remote
        possibility that Internet transmissions containing a User's personally identifiable information may be intercepted by others. There is no way for us to
        ensure the privacy of User information before it arrives at the Site or after it leaves the Site.
