</p>

Consequently, Motul cannot guarantee the availability of the Site and/or services, or reliability of the transmissions and performances in terms of response time and quality.
</p>

<p>The editor's responsibility cannot be invoked if the Site cannot be accessed and/or the services cannot be used.
</p>

<h2>PROTECTION AND PROCESSING OF DATA OF A PERSONAL NATURE</h2>

<p>The site Motul.com&nbsp;presently does not ask for any personal information, account name or password. You can therefore consult this Site without giving your identity or the slightest personal information.

</p>

<p>When you visit our Site, we may place a cookie on your computer. A cookie is a small script sent to your browser by a web server and stored on the hard disk of your computer.
