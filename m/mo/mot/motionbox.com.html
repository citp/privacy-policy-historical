<h3>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy pertains to the use of the Motionbox, Inc. (”Motionbox”) website at http://www.motionbox.com/ which also includes portions of the website that are co-branded or co-labeled with a third party name or brand (the “Motionbox Website” or the “Website”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers how Motionbox treats personal information that Motionbox collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.</p>
<p>Motionbox reserves the right to review all User Content (as defined in our <span class="s1">Terms and Conditions</span>) to verify quality and adherence to our <span class="s1">Terms and Conditions</span>. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to our <span class="s1">Terms and Conditions</span>. Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our <span class="s1">Terms and Conditions</span>. To the extent and provisions in the Privacy Policy conflict with the <span class="s1">Terms and Conditions</span>, the <span class="s1">Terms and Conditions</span> govern your use of this Website.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT BY USING THE MOTIONBOX WEBSITE OR SERVICE, OR BY VISITING THE WEBSITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE.</p>
<h3>Privacy Settings</h3>
<p>Motionbox allows users to upload and display User Content on the Motionbox Website and/or on other websites using the Motionbox “Embeddable Player.” You have a choice of assigning one of three privacy settings to each User Content you post. These include:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><strong>Private</strong>. User Content that you publish as “Private” (”Private User Content”) will be accessible to you and Motionbox personnel in connection with the operation and administration of the Website. You may also share your own Privacy User Content with individuals of your choice.</li>
<li><strong>Protected</strong>. User Content that you publish as “Protected” (”Private User Content”) will be accessible to you and to users you designate as “Contacts” on Motionbox, and to Motionbox personnel in connection with the operation and administration of the Website.
</li><li><strong>Open Access</strong>. User Content that you publish as “Open Access” (”Public User Content”) will be accessible to users of the Motionbox Website, whether or not they are registered Motionbox users and to all partners, affiliates, agents, designees, licensors, licensees or sublicensees (collectively, “Partners”). Furthermore, any Motionbox user can publish your Public User Content on a website other than the Motionbox Website, using the Embeddable Player. In addition, Public User Content may also be available for other Motionbox users to modify, copy, download, or combine with other User Content.</li>
</ul>
<p>You understand and agree that while Motionbox enables you to control who may access your User Content, if you opt to publish your content or otherwise distribute it to other third parties you are making your submissions available to individuals in ways Motionbox cannot and does not control. If you do choose to share your information with third parties Motionbox is not responsible for use of your data by any such third party.</p>
<p>Consistent with its Terms and Conditions, Motionbox and its partners shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with or arising out of your decision to publish User Content as “Shared” or “Open Access” including without limitation decisions you may make to change how this User Content is published. You may later decide to change the access settings to the User Content you publish, but you should be aware that there may still be copies of the content available publicly which Motionbox cannot and does not control.</p>

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users’ trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  This privacy statement covers the Web site http://www.motionbox.com.  Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Motionbox’s Support team at support@motionbox.com.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php.

</ul>
<h3>Third Party Advertisers</h3>
<p>Motionbox may work with and allow other companies (like Google), third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements within the Motionbox Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send the advertisements and links that appear on the Website directly to your web browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and deliver the most relevant ads to you. Motionbox does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out and even then will take steps to ensure respect for the confidentiality of this information. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Motionbox to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, women ages 18-34) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> to learn about the information collection practices and “opt-out” procedures of third party ad networks we may use. Other entities’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. Motionbox’s Privacy Policy does not apply to such other advertisers or web sites.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. In certain areas, we use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>
<p>If Motionbox learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Motionbox may post a notice on our Website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the Website. Motionbox may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@motionbox.com">privacy@motionbox.com</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, Motionbox cannot ensure that all of your personally identifiable information and communications will remain private and will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. Therefore, although we maintain and make every effort to comply with evolving privacy standards, we do not promise, nor should you expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
<p>Your Motionbox account information is password-protected. It is your responsibility to keep your password private. Do not share your password with anyone.</p>

<li>the transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.</li>
