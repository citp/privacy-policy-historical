**What information of yours does the Motivating Moments collect & How is it Used?**

Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable. 

Anonymous information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Motivating Moments LLC collects some information each time a visitor comes to our website. Motivating Moments LLC collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from att.com or aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to our website site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Windows platform). Motivating Moments LLC collects this user information for purposes of website monitoring, improvement, and targeted advertising. You do not have to register with the Motivating Moments LLC before we can collect this anonymous information.

Personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above. Motivating Moments LLC collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of its Web site:

**Registration Form - For Subscription Membership**

Our site's registration form for subscription to our archives requires members to give us contact information including name, address, email address, billing information, demographic information and profile data.

You may choose how you would like to subscribe either on-line or off-line, with a few restrictions. 

On-line subscription membership is available for a yearly subscription. Members are asked to provide certain personal information including name, address, email address, billing information (such as a credit card, checking account or direct debit account number) during the registration process. We use a third party partner http://www.paypal.com PayPal to process all of our online billing. 

It is the Member's responsibility to insure that all information is up-to-date, always. If you have changed your name or email address please contact us at helping@motivateus.com

Off-line subscription, through conventional postal mail, is available on a yearly subscription basis. Money order or certified check are the only two methods of payment at this time.

The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each User's account and may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Motivating Moments LLC.

Personally identifiable information is never sold or leased to any third parties unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. With your permission, we may use your contact information to send you information about our company and what we're doing. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-out section below.

**Submission Forms**

Our Submission form on our website requests that you give us contact information including first name or initial, last name or initial, email address, demographic information (state/province, country) and profile data (age).

**Responses to Email Inquiries**

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Motivating Moments LLC, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Motivating Moments LLC does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.

**Voluntary Customer Surveys**

We may periodically conduct both visitor and member surveys. We encourage our visitors and members to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our surveys is voluntary.

We take the information we receive from individuals and members responding to our Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, geographic location, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.
