**What information of yours does the Motivating Moments collect & How is it Used?**

Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable. 

Anonymous information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Motivating Moments LLC collects some information each time a visitor comes to our website. Motivating Moments LLC collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from att.com or aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to our website site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Windows platform). Motivating Moments LLC collects this user information for purposes of website monitoring, improvement, and targeted advertising. You do not have to register with the Motivating Moments LLC before we can collect this anonymous information.

Personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above. Motivating Moments LLC collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of its Web site:

**Log Files**  
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

**Submission Forms**  
Our Submission form on our website requests that you give us contact information including first name or initial, last name or initial, email address, demographic information (state/province, country) and profile data (age).

Contact information we collect from our forms (such as your email address) is used to process your submission for publication requests. The contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding your submission(s).

**Responses to Email Inquiries**  
When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Motivating Moments LLC, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Motivating Moments LLC does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.

**Voluntary Customer Surveys**  
We may periodically conduct both visitor and member surveys. We encourage our visitors and members to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our surveys is voluntary.

We take the information we receive from individuals and members responding to our Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, geographic location, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
Like many websites, Motivating Moments LLC uses "cookie" technology. When you first connect to our site the cookie identifies you with a unique random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you. The cookie helps us to understand which parts of the website are most popular, where our visitors are going and how long they stay there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on the site so we make the site better. 

These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-Motivating Moments LLC web sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies. 

We also use third party advertisements on Motivating Moments to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

**Choice/Opt-Out:**  
You always have the option of removing your name from any email list to not receive future communications. To ensure immediate removal from any of our communications send us an email at helping@motivateus.com with a copy of the undesired email attached to the request and state your wish to be removed from the mailing list.
