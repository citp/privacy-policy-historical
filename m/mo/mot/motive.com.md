**Our Commitment to Privacy and Protection of Your Personal Data**

Compagnie Financière Alcatel-Lucent (CFAL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcatel-Lucent, and all Alcatel-Lucent legal entities (collectively “Alcatel-Lucent”) recognize that our employees, and the individuals who represent companies with whom we conduct business, value their privacy. However, in order to conduct a global business in this increasingly electronic economy, the collection of the personal data of individuals is often necessary. We respect your right to privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. It is our goal to balance the benefits of e-commerce with your right, as an individual, to prevent the misuse of your personal data.

**What Is Personal Data**

Personal data means any information that, when used alone or combined with other data, may be 

used to identify an individual. This includes, but is not limited to, an individual’s first and last name, e-mail address, mailing and/or residential addresses, telephone number, title, birth date, gender, occupation, customer contact information and/or other personal information that may be required in order for us to provide a service you request, or may have requested, at our web sites.

**Compliance With Laws**

Alcatel-Lucent strives to comply with all applicable and known laws around the world that are designed to protect your right to privacy and prevent misuse of your personal data. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, we intend to adhere to the principles set forth in this Global Privacy and Data Protection Web Site Policy Statement even if we transfer your personal data from your country of residence to countries that may not provide the same privacy rights or require the same level of protection for your personal data. Our commitment is to protect your personal data no matter where it is collected, transported, processed or retained.

**US Subsidiary - Safe Harbor Privacy Statement**

For personal data of individuals that the Alcatel-Lucent US subsidiary, Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc., receives from countries covered by the European Directive 95/46/EC, Alcatel-Lucent is committed to handling such personal data in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. You can find the Safe Harbor certification of Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc. at: [**http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list**](http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list).

You may visit those third-party links at your sole discretion and should read their privacy policies and statements before providing them your personal data.

**Collecting Your Personal Data**

You will be able to browse our web sites anonymously unless you have previously indicated that you wish Alcatel-Lucent to remember your login identification and/or password. In some circumstances, we may request you to provide personal data. Your response to such a request is strictly voluntary. Alcatel-Lucent uses this personal data to customize your experience on our web sites. We also may use your personal data for other business purposes, such as alerting you to products and services that can assist you in your business, promoting site registration, order processing and online customer service.

In general, you can visit our web sites without divulging any personal data.

You are always welcome to visit the public portion of the Alcatel-Lucent web sites without revealing any personal data.

**Use of Your Personal Data**

Alcatel-Lucent will share your personal data with its business partners only if you have provided us with your consent to do so. If you do not want to receive marketing materials from any of our business partners, please do not provide contact information via the Internet, or let them know directly that you wish to be removed from their contact list.

Alcatel-Lucent works with certain companies that deliver Alcatel-Lucent advertising and undertake surveys on behalf of Alcatel-Lucent. These companies may collect information to help us determine which products, services and offerings are of most interest to our current and future customers.

In the event that Alcatel-Lucent sells a part or parts of its business, the personal data that we have collected could be transferred to the acquiring company unless you instruct Alcatel-Lucent not to do so in writing.

Alcatel-Lucent reserves the right to share your personal data to respond to information requests by duly authorized governmental authorities and subject to applicable laws. In exceptionally rare circumstances, where national, state or company security is at issue (such as with the World Trade Center terrorist act in September 2001), Alcatel-Lucent reserves the right to share our entire database of employees, visitors, vendors and customers with the appropriate governmental authorities duly authorized by applicable laws.
