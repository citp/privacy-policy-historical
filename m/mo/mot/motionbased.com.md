**What information about me does MotionBased collect and how is it used?**  
MotionBased only collects personal information about you if you voluntarily choose to share it with MotionBased.

If you later decide to stop receiving these emails, you may opt-out by contacting MotionBased at [support@motionbased.com](mailto:support@motionbased.com), by contacting the third party directly, or by changing your email preferences within your “Account Profile” on www.motionbased.com.

When you visit [www.motionbased.com](http://www.motionbased.com/), a cookie will be stored on your computer. Generally, cookies work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of MotionBased’s website. MotionBased’s cookies do not contain any personally identifying information; MotionBased uses them to provide features such as personalization, to save your member ID and to keep track of your shopping cart. MotionBased may also use cookies to assist it in delivering content specific to your interests. Additionally, after you’ve entered your member ID and password during a session on MotionBased’s website, MotionBased saves that information so you don’t have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the MotionBased website unavailable to you. MotionBased may use your IP address to identify you, to administer MotionBased’s website and to assist in diagnosing problems with MotionBased’s server.

Like most standard Web site servers [www.motionbased.com](http://www.motionbased.com/) uses log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

As a result of displaying ad banners from third parties on [www.motionbased.com](http://www.motionbased.com/), cookies from these advertisers may be stored on your computer when you visit [www.motionbased.com](http://www.motionbased.com/). In addition, MotionBased uses Google Analytics as a method of tracking site statistics and user behavior on its website.

You may decide to send MotionBased personally identifying information in an e-mail message which might contain information or inquiries about MotionBased’s products or services. MotionBased will use this information to identify you as a MotionBased customer and to respond to the electronic mail. MotionBased will only use the information obtained to resolve the issue identified in the e-mail. MotionBased never sells e-mail addresses. You may change your personal information by contacting [support@motionbased.com](mailto:support@motionbased.com).

MotionBased may transfer personal information that you share within the Garmin group of companies in order to provide the products or services that you request. Except as specified above, MotionBased will only share your personal information with third parties if: 

  * MotionBased has your consent; 
  * MotionBased determines that it is required to do so by law; such as in response to a court order or subpoena. 
  * MotionBased finds that you are in breach of its terms and conditions or any of its policies or usage guidelines for specific products or services; 
  * it is necessary in MotionBased’s opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences or attacks on the technical integrity of MotionBased’s site(s) or its network; 
  * it is necessary in MotionBased’s opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of MotionBased or its employees, the users of its website(s), or the public; or 
  * it is necessary to fulfill your product or service order. MotionBased uses a credit card processing company to process your credit card information as required for your order and to ensure that your transaction is secure. This processing company does not retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any other purposes.



**What does MotionBased do to protect the data I transmit to MotionBased?**  
MotionBased’s website uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information such as your name and address, as well as critically sensitive information such as your credit card number. MotionBased engages a company that is an industry leader in online security and site verification to ensure the security of MotionBased’s site. MotionBased’s website is also registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm MotionBased’s identity before any personal information is sent. In addition, MotionBased’s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.

**What does MotionBased do after it gets an order from me?**  
Not only does MotionBased protect your purchase-related information as it is transmitted to MotionBased’s servers, but MotionBased also secures the servers themselves to help prevent unauthorized access to the data after it is in MotionBased’s hands. MotionBased has comprehensive security measures in place to protect its Internet servers, as well as its internal corporate computer resources, from loss, misuse, and alteration. In addition, your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to MotionBased’s ordering system.

**What can I do to help make sure the security works correctly?**  
To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at [www.motionbased.com](http://www.motionbased.com/). Please note: If you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted. MotionBased will not be responsible for any compromise of data that is intercepted due to your use of an unsecured browser.

Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid site identification information for the site you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection. MotionBased recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the site you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal http://), along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the site to which you are connected. MotionBased encourages you to use this to check the validity of any site you connect to using secure communications.

**If my credit card company determines that there are fraudulent charges on my account, what should I do?**  
If your credit card company determines that there are fraudulent charges on your account that are the result of the use of your credit card at www.motionbased.com and they hold you liable for the unauthorized changes, please contact MotionBased immediately. You can contact MotionBased by e-mail at [support@motionbased.com](mailto:support@motionbased.com) or postal mail:

**Does MotionBased offer opt-out or opt-in services?**

**What about the Blog Site?**  
MotionBased maintains a relationship with an outside service provider to administer the online Blog site that can be accessed through MotionBased’s site at <http://blog.motionbased.com/>. This website maintains the look and feel of the [www.motionbased.com](http://www.motionbased.com/) website, but any personal information you provide on the Blog site at <http://blog.motionbased.com/> is stored by the outside service provider. Any personal information submitted on the Blog site is wholly governed by the privacy policy of the outside service provider, which can be found at http://www.sixapart.com/privacy. MotionBased recommends that you read that privacy policy before submitting any personal information on the Blog feature. Although the blog pages may have MotionBased branding, the outside service provider is prominently identified so that you are aware of who is collecting your personal information.

**What about the Forum and Wiki Site?**  
MotionBased maintains a forum, accessible through “My Activities”. MotionBased administers this feature. Any personal information submitted on the forum is wholly governed by this privacy policy. We maintain a separate registration for this feature, requiring just a username, email address and password. MotionBased also maintains a wiki site at [http://wiki.motionbased.com](http://wiki.motionbased.com/), which is accessible through [www.motionbased.com](http://www.motionbased.com/). Any personal information submitted on the wiki site is wholly governed by the privacy policy set forth on the wiki site, which can be found at http://wiki.motionbased.com/mb/MB_Wiki:Privacy_Policy.

If you use the Blog site, the forum or the wiki site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the comment field can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums indefinitely, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. MotionBased is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these fields.

**What MotionBased’s policy regarding children’s use of MotionBased’s website?**  
While MotionBased encourages everyone to visit its website and learn about the company and GPS technology and applications, MotionBased has no desire to collect information from those under the age of 18. Any instance of personal information about a minor being collected would be purely accidental and unintentional.

**Where can I learn more about using the Internet and protecting my privacy?**  
The United States Federal Trade Commission has a web page <http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html> devoted to providing you with information about protecting your privacy online. MotionBased encourages you to familiarize yourself with the concepts discussed on this page.

**Privacy/Security Policy changes**  
If MotionBased makes changes to any terms or conditions of this Privacy/Security Statement, these changes will be posted on MotionBased’s websites in a timely manner. If MotionBased decides to change this Privacy/Security Statement it will post those changes on this Privacy/Security Statement and other places MotionBased deems appropriate, which may include its website, for a period of time MotionBased deems appropriate, so that you are aware of what information MotionBased collects, how MotionBased uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, MotionBased discloses it. MotionBased reserves the right to modify this Privacy/Security Statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If MotionBased makes material changes to this Privacy/Security Statement, MotionBased will update this Privacy/Security Statement and notify you by means of a notice on MotionBased’s website. In case of a business transaction in which a portion or all of MotionBased’s business is acquired, MotionBased will notify you as described above in this paragraph.
