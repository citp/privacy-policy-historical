Payment information (such as payment card number) and information about the security vulnerability of users’ websites is protected, by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the aforementioned information when viewed online.

While on a secured page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Firefox, Safari and Chrome becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing.

In addition, we limit access to personally identifiable information to employees who we believe reasonably need to receive such information to provide our Services or in order to do their jobs and take other precautions we deem reasonable to protect the security of users’ personally identifiable information.

However, users should be aware that we cannot fully guarantee the security of their personally identifiable information.
