# Privacy Policy - MouthHealthy - American Dental Association

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT CAREFULLY. It explains how the American Dental Association (ADA) and/or its subsidiary and affiliated entities (collectively, "ADA," "we," "us" or "our") collects information about you (whether you're a parent or a child) through our website and how this information is then used or disclosed. This Privacy Policy statement does not apply to those of our websites that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy policy statements or to information we may collect from you or about you in other ways, including through emails you may send to us. We may update this statement from time to time by posting updated terms. You are responsible for periodically reading this statement. If you use the MouthHealthy™ website after we have updated this statement, you acknowledge that you have read the updated terms and consent to our revised privacy practices.

This Privacy Policy statement describes our privacy practices, including what information we collect from you through this website, and what we then do with this information. If you are a minor, please be sure to get your parents to review and discuss this privacy policy statement with you, and get their permission, before using the MouthHealthy site.

We encourage parents to talk about what information their children should and shouldn't share online, and other restrictions about the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. We hope that our privacy practices as described in this statement will remove any concerns that parents may have about their children visiting the MouthHealthy site. We do not intentionally gather personal information about visitors who are under the age of 18. 

By using the MouthHealthy website you acknowledge that you have read this privacy policy statement and consent to our privacy practices as described in this statement, including our use and disclosure of personal information for the purposes described below. This statement is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal right in or on behalf of any person.

Residents of the State of California, please also read Your Privacy Rights to understand additional rights you may have pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83.   
IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE MouthHealthy WEBSITE.

#### Information we Collect Through the MouthHealthy Website

This Privacy Policy statement only applies to information that we collect through the MouthHealthy website, and does not apply to any information we collect through any other means. We collect two types of information from you and other visitors: (1) "personally identifiable information" (as described below) and (2) non-personally identifiable information (as described below).

"Personally identifiable information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your personally identifiable information through our websites:

  * we may collect your email address, first and last name, and zip code, if you sign up for an online newsletter; 
  * we may collect your email address if you contact us with a question; 
  * we may collect your first and last name, date of birth, and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and 
  * we may collect your first and last name, your address, and your credit card and billing information to enable you to make a purchase. 



"Non-personally identifiable information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender, or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does not identify you personally. If you do provide us with non-personally identifiable information, we may use it for the purposes described in this statement or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose. Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your non-personally identifiable information through our websites, and how we use such information: 

  * Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your "IP address" is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data, such as the screens and pages of the MouthHealthy website that you view. We use this information to deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our websites to the interests of you and our other visitors, and to measure traffic to and within our websites. 
  * Cookie. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the MouthHealthy website. For example, when you visit a screen or page a cookie is placed on your computer (if you or your browser accepts the cookie). This cookie may then be read by screen or pages on our website. You may configure your browser to notify you or to reject and block cookies, but if you do, you may not have access to some areas of the MouthHealthy website, or to the personalized features of our websites. 
  * Web Beacon. A "web beacon," "clear gif," "web bug," or "pixel tag" is a tiny graphic file with a unique identifier that is similar in function to a cookie, but allows us to count the number of users that have visited certain pages or screens of the MouthHealthy website, and help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens. 
  * Demographic Information. "Demographic information" may be your gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may collect such information about you through the MouthHealthy website and use it to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure that our site and services and the information on them is targeted to meet your needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information. 



If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that screen or page.

#### Use of Information Collected Through the MouthHealthy Website

#### Sharing and Disclosure of Information Collected Through the MouthHealthy Site 

Personally identifiable information: Primarily, we may share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following instances: 

  * To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you choose to watch an educational video we may share your personally identifiable information to provide the program to you. In addition, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information to fulfill the terms of that promotion, including for prize fulfillment purposes or with mail carriers. We also may share your information with co-sponsors of such promotion. 
  * To offer you products from our affiliates, strategic partners, agents, or from third-party marketers and other unaffiliated parties that we believe may be of interest to you, or to assist such parties for research, administrative, and/or business purposes. These parties may contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or they may use such information for their own research, administration or business purposes. 
  * To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents, or independent contractors who help us maintain our websites and us with other administrative services (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on our behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions). We seek to ensure that such unaffiliated third-parties will not use your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than that for which they are responsible. However, we cannot guarantee that they will not use it for any other purpose. 
  * To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on MouthHealthy.org, we may ask you for your credit card number, billing address, and other information in connection with completing such purchase, and we may use such information to fulfill your purchase.

******California Residents – Your Privacy Rights  
**(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)   
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. 

However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy statement) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.

As stated in our Privacy Policy Statement, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting-in to receive information from a third party. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on our website. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third-party's privacy policies and practices. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policies and practices of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e- mailing legal@ada.org. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
