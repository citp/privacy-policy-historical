### What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information: 

Our online forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, address, interests, and similar information. We do not request or store sensitive information from our visitors, such as social security numbers or complete credit card numbers. We do not sell any lists nor do we make lists available for use by outside organizations.

### Internet Protocol Address: 

We collect an IP address from all visitors to our Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track site usage and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Site. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

### Use of "Cookies": 

We use cookies, small files that are sent to your Web browser and stored on your computer's hard drive, to improve your Web site experience. The cookie is used to speed up your access to the Web site and the information you wish to see, but it does not contain any personal information. The majority of Web browsers accept cookies, but your browser should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies. However, please be aware that if you block cookies, some Web site functionality may be lost. 

### Security: 

All sensitive information provided to Mount Washington Observatory is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect sensitive information by restricting access to that information to certain qualified employees of Mount Washington Observatory. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.
