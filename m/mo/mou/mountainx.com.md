## Privacy Policy

Mountain Xpress has developed this privacy policy as part of its commitment to protecting individuals’ privacy.

When you visit our Web pages, we automatically log your Internet domain or address (IP address), geographic location and the Web location you clicked from, so we can tell how many people visit each page and how they find us. If you click on an ad, this is recorded so we can inform advertisers how many people respond to their ads. Some of our pages may place a small text file (a "cookie") on your computer so we can identify it when you visit. Most Web browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent. However, some Web features and services may not function properly with cookies disabled.

We use Google Analytics to monitor and analyze traffic on our site. Most of our pages contain a code that causes Google to place a cookie on your computer to enable this monitoring. For information on how Google uses its cookies, consult the [Google privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

We or our advertisers may use a third-party advertising company to serve some of the ads you see on our site. This company may use information about your visits to our and other Web sites in order to provide ads that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving ads to our site, an advertising company may place a cookie on your computer. 

Our sites may ask you for personally identifying information – such as your name, address and email address – for various reasons, such as: You are purchasing something, registering for our site as a member, taking a survey. You may refuse to provide the information. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under age 13.

If you are purchasing a product or service through the Xpress websites you may be asked to enter financial information (such as credit card numbers, and/or billing address). Credit card numbers are never stored by Xpress and are used only during the billing process. We use the reputable [Authorize.Net payment gateway](http://www.authorize.net/) to process credit cards. Their security and privacy statements can be found on [their website](http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/).

When gathering personally identifying information, we will not release any such information to third parties unless: 1) at the time of gathering the information, we specifically state our intention to do so, 2) at some later time, we ask for and receive your permission to release the information, 3) if at any time you give us your consent, 4) we believe in good faith that we are legally required to do so, 5) there is an emergency involving personal danger, 6) you have vandalized our site or behaved in a manner that warrants our contacting governmental regulatory authorities or your Internet service provider.
