# Mountain Project's Privacy Policy

Last updated: 12/8/05

**1\. What information does Mountain Project collect?**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Several of the services and features that we offer require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage. 

We collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, zip code, and gender when you provide it to us. Once you register with Mountain Project you are no longer anonymous to us.

**2\. What is Mountain Project's practice regarding cookies?**

Your internet browser has a feature called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to Mountain Project. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most of our sites, although use of certain features and areas may require cookies. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use the information to enhance your services. By adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected.

We also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our site, and information about pages you visited. 

We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: 

  


  * Keeping count of return visits to our site; 
  * Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on Web-site and advertisement usage;
  * Determining which features our overall user population likes best; 
  * Saving your username and/or password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites; 
  * Displaying the most appropriate advertising or content based on your interests.



We allow other companies that are presenting advertisements to use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit the Web site of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. 

**3\. How does Mountain Project share the information?**

Personally identifiable information

We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people when: 

  * You volunteer information or create a public profile in the course of your participation. 
  * When required by law, such as when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process. 
  * We believe that your actions violate applicable laws, Mountain Project Terms of Use, or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others.



Aggregate information

We aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.

**5\. What are my options?**

Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can still view much of the content and use many of the services without registering.

**8\. Privacy of children**

Mountain Project is not directed to children under the age of 13.
