Effective Date: May 18, 2017

This Privacy Policy applies to the Mouseflow, ApS owned and operated websites and its subdomains (“Sites”). Mouseflow, ApS (Mouseflow,” “we,” or “us”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Mouseflow when you access the Sites and Mouseflow Service (including through the websites of our partners), how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service. The use of information collected through our Sites shall be limited to the purposes under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service to customers.

  1. Information We Collect.

(a) Our Service: We may collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your full name, phone number and email address, when you register for an account. If you choose to purchase a product from us, we or our third-party payment processors will collect your payment information. We also collect data through our partners (customers) who use the Mouseflow Service (including by embedding our code on their websites) on their websites or mobile applications. When you use the Mouseflow Service or if you visit such websites or mobile applications, we may receive certain information about you as described below. We do not send any promotional emails; however, we may send you service related emails related to your account. If you no longer wish to receive these emails, you may opt out of them by canceling your account. 

(b) Cookies And Tracking Technologies: Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Mouseflow and our partners (such as advertising, marketing and analytics), affiliates or analytics or service providers. These technologies may be used in analyzing trends, administering the Sites, tracking users’ movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by such companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. Our partners may also use such technologies to deliver advertisements to you as described below. While we respect the privacy of our users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time. We use cookies to remember users’ settings as well as for authentication and analytics. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Sites may be limited.

(c) Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile application each time you access our Sites or the Mouseflow Service. For example, when you access our Sites or the Mouseflow Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and other such information. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

(d) Information Related To Data Collected For Our Customers: Mouseflow collects information under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose data it may process. If you are a client of one of our current customers and would no longer like to be contacted by such customer, please contact our customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

(e) Access And Retention Of Data Controlled By Our Customers: An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to a Mouseflow customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
