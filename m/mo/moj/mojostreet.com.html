<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Mojostreet Infomedia Services Pvt.  Ltd. (“<em>Mojostreet</em>,”  “we,” or “us”)  knows that you care about how your personal information  is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy explains what information of  yours will be collected by <em>Mojostreet</em> when you use the <em>Mojostreet</em> Service. Additionally, it  explains how you can control the collection,  correction and/or deletion of such  information. We will not use or  share your information with anyone except as  described in this Privacy  Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to  information we collect by  other means (including offline) or from other  sources. Capitalized  terms that are not defined in this policy are defined in  our Terms of  Use. Our expectation is that <em>Mojostreet</em> Users will use this  service for harmless social purposes. We would like to  extend a  cautionary note however, that by its nature, your location information   may be subject to misuse and over-monitoring by others including your  friends,  family, or acquaintances. We therefore request you to manage  your own mobile  and profile privacy preferences on the service on a  periodic basis.</p>

    <p><strong>What Information Is Collected?</strong><br>

    </p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>
      Mojostreet will store the information that you provide to us during the registration process as well as during the use of the Service. This information may include but is not limited to your email address, name, picture, phone number, and/ or Facebook/Twitter login ids as well as non identifying information like gender,  Birthday etc. While using the service, you may choose to share more information such as locations and tips, photos which may be publicly displayed to other Users and third party sites or services depending on your privacy and opt-in settings. Mojostreet automatically receives information about your location when you use the service. This device information is used for improving the content of the service, customizing the advertizing on the Service and communicating with you about offers and discounts. 
      <br><br>

		We will also collect the email, phone numbers, FB IDs of your friends when you use our mobile applications in a safe and encrypted format. This information is used for the sole purpose of helping your build your network on Mojostreet and also help your find your friends. <br><br>

		We also automatically collect certain information when you use Mojostreet, such as your location/GPS coordinates (if you enable this feature), a device identifier (but not the UDID), MAC address, Internet Protocol (IP) address (if using a browser), operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring site and your activity on Mojostreet.<br><br>


	We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies”. These are small files that your browser places on your computer. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our services, and to improve our services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
      <!--<strong>Provided by User</strong><br />

        <em>Mojostreet</em> will store the information that you  provide to us during the registration  process as well as during the use  of the Service. This information may include but  is not limited to  your email address, birthday, and/ or Facebook/Twitter login  ids. While  using the service, you may choose to share more information such as   locations and tips which may be publicly displayed to other Users and  third  party sites or services depending on your privacy and opt-in  settings. <em>Mojostreet</em> automatically receives information  about  your location when you use the service. This personal information is  used  for improving the content of the service, customizing the  advertizing on the  Service and communicating with you about offers and  discounts.</p>

      <p><strong>Automatically collected</strong><br />

        When you use the service, <em>Mojostreet</em> automatically  records  information including your location, IP address, browser and  page requested from  your browser or mobile platform. We treat this  information as personally  non-identifiable and use it only in aggregate  form, unless otherwise required  to under applicable law. We may  provide aggregate information to <em>Mojostreet</em> partners about how our customers  collectively use the Service.--></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>How Is My Information Protected?</strong><br>

      <em>Mojostreet</em> uses commercially reasonable physical,  managerial, and technical safeguards to  preserve the integrity and  security of your personal information. However, <em>Mojostreet</em> cannot guarantee the security  of user account information. Unauthorized  entry or use, hardware or software  failure, and other factors may  compromise the security of user information at  any time.</p>

    <p>Your <em>Mojostreet</em> account personal information is  protected by a password  for your privacy and security. You can prevent  unauthorized access to your  account and personal information by  selecting and protecting your password  appropriately and limiting  access to your computer and browser by signing off  after you have  finished accessing your account.</p>

    <p><strong>How Is My Information Shared?</strong><br>

    </p>

    <blockquote>

      <p><strong>Sharing with friends</strong><br>

        Your “friends” see the location  and time of each of your  check-ins, tips and photos (that you leave there), presidentships.   While your friends will be able to see the time of your check-ins, other  users  will only be shown the date of the check-in. Individuals reading  this  information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or  entities without  our control and without your knowledge. Hence we urge  you to exercise caution  while adding a user as a “friend”.</p>

      <p> <strong>Sharing with everyone</strong><br>

        Information such as your name and  picture, social network  links, presidentships, list of friends, tips, photos  are shared by  default with the <em>Mojostreet</em> community. However, you can choose  to restrict the visibility of your check-in  related information to your  friends only. </p>

      <p><strong>Sharing with partners and  authorities</strong><br>

        <em>Mojostreet</em> works closely with its partners in order to provide discounts and other offers  to you through <em>Mojostreet</em>’s service.  Mojostreet may choose to share your personal information with its partners for  the potential benefit of customers.<br>

        We may release personal  information when we believe in good  faith that it is necessary in order to  comply with the law of the land,  to enforce our terms of use or to protect the  rights, property, or  safety of <em>Mojostreet</em>,  our employees, our users, or others.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Your Choices About Your Information</strong><br>

      You have the right to decline to  submit personally  identifiable information through the service. If you choose  to do so, <em>Mojostreet</em> may not be able  to provide certain services to you. You may update or  correct your account  information [and email preferences] at any time by  logging in to your account.            Currently your check-ins have two  privacy settings. <strong>By default, check-ins are shared with everyone</strong>. You may  choose to share a check-in with only your friends at the time of check-in and  bypass the default setting.</p>

    <p><strong>How Is  Information Removed From My Account?</strong><br>

      Even after you remove information from your account or  profile, copies of  that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to  the extent it has been  shared with others, it was otherwise distributed  pursuant to your privacy  settings, or it was copied or stored by other  users.</p>

    <p><strong>Tracking</strong><br>

      Mojostreet uses Google Analytics  to better understand who is  using the Service, and how it is being used. Google  Analytics uses  cookies to collect and store anonymous information such as the  time(s)  of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, IP   address, and type of operating system used. We use this information to  improve  the Service and make it appealing to as many users as possible.</p>

    <p><strong>Links</strong><br>

      You may come across links to  external websites on <em>Mojostreet</em>.  We  are not responsible for the practices employed by these websites.  This privacy  policy governs only the practices collected on our  service.</p>

    <p><strong>Will There Be Changes To This Privacy Policy?</strong>&nbsp;<br>

      Mojostreet may amend this Privacy Policy periodically. Use  of  information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect  at the  time such information is used. If we make material changes in  the way we use  Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an  announcement on our <u>Service</u> or by sending you an email. Users are  bound by any changes to the Privacy  Policy when they use the Service  after such changes have been first posted.</p>

    <p><strong>What If I Have Questions Or Concerns?</strong>&nbsp;If you have any questions or concerns  regarding your privacy while using the Service, please send a detailed message  to:&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:privacy@mojostreet.com">privacy@mojostreet.com</a></strong>. We will make every effort to resolve your  concerns. </p>
