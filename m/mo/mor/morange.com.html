                    <strong>COOKIES </strong><br>
In order to provide you with personalized service, Morange uses

cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID
cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains
on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent

removing cookies may not allow you to take full advantage of all
Morange features. <br>
