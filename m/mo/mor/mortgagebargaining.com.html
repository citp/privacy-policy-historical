Welcome to mortgagebargaining.com (the "Site").<br> <br>We understand that privacy

deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining 
some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally 
Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally 
deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable 
Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.

<br><b>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</b><br> We will let our 
Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by 
posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy 
in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information 
that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, 
we will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or 
Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.
