<p>This policy applies to “users” and "customers" (or "you") of The Economist Group; that is anyone ordering, registering or interacting with any product or service from any of The Economist Group businesses. This includes event attendees, subscribers, registrants, website users, app users etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Collection and use of your information</b></p>
<p>The information you provide us, and that which we gather based on your activity, helps us to deliver more relevant content as well as create a more seamless experience across the products and channels through which you may access that content.</p>
<p>We collect and store some information about you in order to deliver products and services to you (such as your subscription, or so that you can attend an Economist Event). We share some of that information with trusted suppliers (including payment providers and postal services) to ensure the delivery of those products and services, or to give personalised recommendations on things we think will be of interest to you. We also collect information when you use our products and services and further details are provided below.</p>
<p><a id="info_we_collect"></a><b>Information we collect</b></p>

</ul>
<p>You can also volunteer to disclose additional information which may not be essential for us to deliver a service to you. By providing it you help us to ensure we communicate with you in a way that’s most relevant, useful and engaging for you. We may collect and ask for additional information when you order, purchase, register, subscribe or make use of our products or services in any way, for example in person, via our marketing campaigns, via phone or mail order, or our websites.</p>
<p><b>Information we receive from third parties</b></p>
<p>We occasionally work with third parties who provide additional information that you have shared with them, such as your telephone number and postal address (for example if you’ve moved house or updated your phone number and we need to contact you with important service information). Some third parties may also share further information about your interaction on our sites to help us personalise our services to you. More information can be found in the Audience Profiling section below.</p>
<p><b>Information we do not track</b></p>
<p>We do not track or collect any sensitive information about you. This includes race, religion, ethnicity, and political opinion.</p>
<p><b>How we use your information</b></p>
<p>We primarily use your information for the purpose of delivering the products and services that you have chosen and to personalise our interactions (including advertising) with you. For further details about this, and other ways we may use your information, please read the sections below.</p>
<p><b>To provide products and services;</b></p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>To manage customer service queries and complaints.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To manage your privacy preferences and to ensure you only receive communications that you have requested, which may include using your details to suppress you from communications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To send you administrative emails about your account, reminders for upcoming events, service changes, or new policies. These updates, changes and notifications are essential for the services that you have selected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To provide general location-based services (e.g. the region or country you are in), advertising or search results for our content.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To detect and reduce fraud including fraudulent orders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To prevent users from posting illegal, offensive or objectionable comments on our site.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To run competitions, prize draws and promotions or if you agree to be a speaker or contributor at, or in, one of our events, projects or films. In these cases, subject to any specific terms The Economist Group agrees with you separately, you grant a global right to The Economist Group to use your name, picture, likeness, voice, biographical information and statements, for advertising, trade, publicity and promotional purposes in all media now known or discovered afterwards and on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To deliver marketing and advertising</b></p>
<p>We need your consent to use your information for some specific purposes such as marketing, brand response communications and personalised advertising. Ways in which we will use your information if you consent are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may send marketing communications via a range of channels including email and push notifications and you can opt-out of these at any time. If you give us marketing permission, we may contact you to tell you about special offers and related or similar products or services within The Economist Group.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We may pass your information to specially selected third parties who would like to contact you with information regarding their own products and services such as other subscriptions, events or content services.&nbsp; Those parties are responsible for their use of your data and you should read their privacy policies carefully. For more information on how we work with third parties please see the section below.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will ask you if you wish to opt-out of such marketing when you first sign up to receive our products or services. You can also update your preferences for your <i>Economist </i>subscription at any time via your online account at economist.com or by contacting customer services (see ‘<a onclick="return !window.open(this.href);" href="#contact_us">Contact us</a>’). You can also opt-out of email marketing by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our emails. Other parts of The Economist Group will inform you of how to opt out of such marketing communications, or you can contact us. This does not apply to important service notifications such as payment confirmations (as covered in the section above) or where we have some other legal basis for contacting you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In order to deliver advertising and marketing messages that are relevant to you, we may use the information we hold about you, including details that we collate from your use of our services or third parties, such as more precise information on your location or your company's profile (ie. company name, company size), to ensure that the advertising you see is of interest to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Other uses of your information</b></p>
<p>Other than where we have asked for your consent, we mainly rely on two other separate bases to lawfully use your information. First, we need to use your information in certain ways to provide our products or services to you, in accordance with our contracts with you. In this case, it is necessary for us to use your information so that we can deliver the products or services you have chosen. Second, as described in more detail below, in certain cases, we may use your information where necessary to further our legitimate interests, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>To measure customer and user response and engagement with our products and services such as online content, email newsletters and subscription offers. This may include sharing your information with third parties who help us to analyse and measure these things.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To ensure our products (including websites and apps) are compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by most of our visitors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To help us improve our customer and user experience and to support new product development. We may send customer satisfaction surveys and market research questionnaires (for which we may share your information with third party suppliers employed by us).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To create audience profiles for personalised advertising, marketing or research and development on and off our websites – See <strong><a href="#audience">Audience Profiling</a> </strong>and <a href="#social_media"><b>Social media</b></a> sections below for more detailed information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To detect and reduce fraudulent activity and for other security related purposes such as to help us protect against harassment, IP infringement, crime or other security issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For any purpose required by law or regulation and to verify information that we provide to third parties for compliance and audit purposes such as the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC). We may share your personal data with a third-party auditing organisation such as ABC so they can verify aggregated statistics about circulation and usage of our products or review our policies, processes and procedures for compliance with relevant standards. You can view their privacy policy by following <a href="https://www.abc.org.uk/privacy-policy">this link</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the right to object to any of the above uses of your information, please contact us if you wish to do so. We will consider all objections reasonably, but there may be legal reasons where we deem that the use of your information is still appropriate. We will explain our decision to you in a timely manner.</p>
<p><a id="social_media"></a><b>Social media</b></p>
<p>The Economist Group publishes content on social media platforms e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn through both "organic" and "paid" methods to reach current and potential readers:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Organic” methods describe where content and/or offers are published onto a social platform so that they may appear in your social platform’s content, without being promoted or forced to appear more prominently, e.g. The Economist’s Facebook page.</li>
<li>“Paid” methods describe where content and/or offers are published onto a social platform so that they will appear more prominently, or be shown to users that do not currently follow The Economist Group's social pages e.g. a promoted tweet on your Twitter timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may place one or more social media platform “tags” on our website in order to better understand how The Economist Group may be of best value to you by providing you with the most relevant content available according to what you have chosen to read on our own websites. These tags only record information around events to help us understand if you are registered or subscribed with us, so that we may use your reading preferences to provide more relevant content and/or offers to you, on social media platforms, e.g. removing subscription offers from your feed if you are a current subscriber.</p>
<p>We do not have direct access to your personal data on your social media platforms.</p>
<p><a id="audience"></a><b>How we use your details for audience profiling</b></p>
<p>To enable us to personalise the content and advertising you see (including on social media), we may use your interaction and browsing behaviour or preferences (such as how and what you read on our websites and our apps) to create audience profiles. This is to enable content and message personalisation, and in some cases, advertising to be delivered to you or a group of users (an audience) with similar interests to you. This can be done both on our site and on those of third parties. Please see our <a href="http://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/Cookies_information.html">Cookie Policy</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We may analyse your individual information to create a profile of your interests and preferences as a part of an audience.&nbsp; These insights are used to help us make marketing decisions so that we can ensure our messages are relevant to you. There are times we may use additional information available from external sources to help us do this effectively (see <a href="#third_parties"><b>How we work with third parties</b></a> section below).</p>
<p>You can choose to opt out of our audience profiling activity if you wish. This does not mean that you will no longer see advertisements, it just means that the advertisements you will see are no longer personalised to your interests. Please contact us to do so.</p>
<p><a id="third_parties"></a><b>How we work with third parties</b></p>
<p>In some instances, we disclose personal information to third parties when it is necessary to deliver a service or product, or to help us improve your experience with us, or when we are required to do so by contract or law. “Third parties” include agents, subcontractors, sponsors and other associated organisations. We have in place contracts to ensure the information remains secure and limited in use, and if we do not have a legitimate business reason to pass on your information, we will ask you to give consent first. Some examples of when we share your information are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you make a payment on any of our sites your payment will be processed by a specialist payment processor to ensure a secure transaction. All payment processors used by The Economist Group are compliant with required security standards. If you have any questions regarding secure transactions, please contact the Data Privacy team by completing our&nbsp;<a href="http://privacyportal.economist.com">enquiry form</a> or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataprivacy@economist.com?Subject=Website%20Secure%20Transactions%20Question" target="_blank">dataprivacy@economist.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When you log on to your subscription account for the newspaper, a third party provider who specialises in online account management will manage your access, including re-setting your password.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When we send you an email or a push notification, these are delivered by marketing platforms. As part of this service, certain information such as message opens, clicks and formatting are recorded to help deliver the best email experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When we test and launch new products, services or offers, we may work with trusted third parties to support us.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We also employ third parties to carry out statistical analyses and conduct surveys on our behalf, to support our advertising and content production efforts respectively.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To provide information for auditing purposes by official regulators.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To enhance your profile with non-personal information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To enable third parties such as advertisers or sponsors to contact you with information about their own products and services that may be of interest – only if you give explicit permission for us to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Third parties who pass information to us</b></p>
<p>Our subscriptions services sometimes use additional information such as telephone numbers or postcodes from third parties (like list brokers, researchers or telemarketing agents, who have gathered this information lawfully) to help us to contact you with important service updates via phone or post or to help us make marketing decisions. This includes advertising (by ourselves or via advertising partners) to groups of people with particular interests. These third parties may give us access to your personal information, if you have allowed them to do so.</p>
<p>We may also work with third parties to identify individuals who may be interested in our products and services or in some cases our sponsors / advertisers’ products and services. These third parties may give us access to your personal information, if you have allowed them to do so. In any communication you receive from us, through these third parties, we make sure to identify ourselves (and them) so that you know who has access to your information.</p>
<p><b><i>IMPORTANT:</i></b><i> Please note that the collection, use, and disclosure of information by these third parties are described in their own Privacy Policies, and consequently may differ from that set out in The Economist Group’s Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for those third party Privacy Policies, and you should ensure that you have read and understood all applicable Privacy Policies before proceeding.</i></p>
<p><a id="retain_info"></a><b>Retaining and storing your information</b></p>
<p><b>Retention policy</b></p>
<p>We securely store your information, and hold it for as long as we need to in order to provide our services and products to you in accordance with (i) applicable law, or (ii) as long as is set out in any relevant contract you have with us.</p>
<p>We review our retention periods for personal information regularly. If you have not interacted with us in any way, we will generally no longer hold your information after 5 years (although this may be shorter for individual businesses (you can confirm by contacting us)). Sometimes we may need to keep it for longer periods such as for tax and other financial regulatory reasons, this would typically be 7 years.
