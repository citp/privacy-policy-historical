<strong>Web Site Information Collection</strong>
<br>
For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name or IP address, but not the e-mail address. Unless otherwise
stated on our web site, we collect only the domain name or IP address of
visitors to our Web page, the e- mail addresses of those who communicate
with us via e-mail, the e- mail addresses of those who make postings to
our chat areas, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or
visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or
visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey
information and/or registrations to access portions of the site and its
associated services. We use SSL (secure socket layer) encryption for
online payment collection for purchases of our own proprietary products
and services. We rely on third party providers for some of our products
and services--the privacy policies of those sites govern the method by
which they collect and use such information.</p>

<p>
<strong>Use of Web Site Information Collected</strong><br>
The information we collect is used to create an aggregate demographic profile of our user base so that we can improve the content of our Web site and provide aggregate information to potential advertisers (no individual information is provided to any
third-party without your consent), to customize the content and/or
layout of our page for each individual visitor, to notify consumers
about updates to our Web site, to send visitors our opt-in e-mail
newsletter(s) (if requested by the visitor), to provide users with the
products and/or services for which they signed-up or registered which
may include sending service disruption notices or other service- or
product-related information via e-mail, and is not shared with other
organizations for commercial purposes without the visitor's consent.
</p>

<p>Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes
other than those for which it was originally collected by sending us
e-mail at the above address.</p>

<p>Upon request we provide site visitors with access to contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them. You can access this information,
and/or have it corrected, by sending us e-mail at the above address.
</p>

<p>
<strong>E-mail and Direct Response Contact</strong>

<strong><i>All of our direct response methods are opt-in</i></strong>.

lists (such as but not limited to those run for us by Postmaster Direct
and DoubleClick), your e-mail may be made available to other
organizations whose products or services you might find interesting. If
you do not want your e-mail address to be shared with other companies or
organizations, please do not opt into this e-mail list when asked this
question. If you opted into this list(s) and want to opt out, follow the
instructions on the e-mail that is sent to you to "Unsubscribe" to that

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the
information for which you provided us your address. Persons who supply
us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone
contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed
on-line or with information regarding their inquiry.</p>

<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
<br>
We, and some of our partners who provide some of
the services and products on our site, use cookies to record session
information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart,
record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit,
record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when
visitors return to our site , customize Web page content based on
visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends, and
to enable access to specific areas on the web site such as but not
limited to our Intranet and other registered users sections.</p>

<p>
<strong>Ad Servers and Other Partners</strong>
<br>
To try and bring you offers that may be of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads or provide other services or
products on our Web pages and e-mail newsletter(s) and other services.
As a result of your visit to our site, these companies may collect
non-personally-identifiable information such as your domain type, your
IP address and clickstream information.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Children's Guidelines</strong>
<br>
This website is directed at adults, not children, and we do not seek to collect from children online contact information or distribution to third parties any personally identifiable information from children or entice children to divulge information to us.</p>

<p>
<strong>Security</strong>
<br>
When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our site (which is displayed automatically depending on your
browser's security settings). We strive to maintain appropriate security
measures in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse
or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our
site. Although we take reasonable measures to secure our data, we cannot
guarantee that the measures we take are or will remain adequate. Some
portions of our site link to other companies' web sites. Please refer to
the privacy policies of those sites for information on how they handle
security for information they collect.</p>

<p>
<strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong>
<br>
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this Privacy Policy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our Web site's Privacy Policy page to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out
of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is
used, you should check back at our Web site's Privacy Policy page
periodically.</p>  </div>
