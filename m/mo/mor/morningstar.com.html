      <p><b>What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?</b><br> 
When you register on Morningstar.com or subscribe to a Premium Membership or any other paid service on Morningstar.com, you will be asked to complete a registration form. This registration form includes certain personal information, such as your name, street address, e-mail address, as well as other demographic information like age, gender and household income. In addition, when you subscribe to any paid service on Morningstar.com or purchase any product on our Internet site, we also require your credit card information.</p>
      <p>We use your name, address, and e-mail address to contact you about Morningstar.com, to send you information about other products/services we think might interest you and to fulfill and ship any products that you may order from us. Morningstar does not share your e-mail address with its unaffiliated partners. However, we do offer certain well-screened partners the opportunity to send you through regular postal mail information about products and services that we think might interest you. During the registration/subscription process (and at any time thereafter), you can decide whether or not you wish to receive this sort of information from Morningstar and its partners. Details on how to control the use of your information are found below (How to Control or Change Your Profile).</p>
  <p>The demographic and personal profile information that we collect during the registration/subscription process, such as household income, age, and gender, are used only in aggregate. Morningstar does not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Instead, we use this information to create content and functionality that best serves the needs and interests of our users and to improve the quality of the service we provide you.</p>
 
 <p><b>How Is Portfolio Information Used and Protected?</b><br> 
We recognize that your portfolio information is very sensitive, and protecting the privacy of this information is a top priority for us. The contents of your portfolio are kept strictly confidential and are not shared with any third parties. </p>

<p><b>What About Internet Provider (IP) Addresses and Cookies?</b><br> 
Morningstar.com logs IP addresses and browser types, but we do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information. This means that, while a user's session is tracked, the identity of that user remains anonymous. We also use these IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p> 
  <p>Cookies are used for the same reasons. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer's hard drive that allow us to monitor what sort of content on Morningstar.com you find most interesting. By better understanding how you and our other users are using Morningstar.com, we can develop tools and customize content to personalize and improve everyone's experience. We also use cookies to remember your passwords for you (so that you don't have to keep re-entering them each time you come back to the site) and to better target that advertising on the site that we think will be of most interest to you. Your privacy and security are not compromised when you accept a cookie from Morningstar.com because we do not use cookies to collect personal information. Please note, however, that advertisers on our site may also serve you their own cookies when you click through to their sites. We do not control, nor do we have access to, any of the information that they may collect.</p>
  <p>Of course, you can choose not to accept the cookie by adjusting your browser settings but, if you choose to do so, you may not be able to take full advantage of the certain customized content on Morningstar.com, such as the Portfolio Manager tool or free areas such as Conversations and University.</p>

<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b><br>
To provide you with a more complete resource for investment information and services, Morningstar.com contains links to certain other sites, such as Amazon.com and Qpass. In some instances, we will share demographic information on our users with sites that link to Morningstar.com, but again, this information is shared on an aggregate basis only. Please note that you may be required to register with a site that links to Morningstar.com in order to take advantage of that site's services (for example, ordering a book through Amazon.com that was recommended on Morningstar.com).</p>
 <p>We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of these sites; you should refer to these sites' privacy policies for details.</p>

<p><b>The Conversations Area</b><br>
The Conversations area allows users to engage in a lively discussion with a community of intelligent investors. Please remember that any information you disclose in the Conversations area, including your e-mail address and user name, will become public information. We post user names and e-mail addresses to encourage responsible, productive discussions, but we can not prevent parties unrelated to Morningstar from accessing this public information. Please remember that, by disclosing your name and e-mail address in the Conversations area, you open yourself up to the possibility that you may receive unsolicited e-mail from parties outside of Morningstar.</p>
  <p>We encourage you to maintain a healthy skepticism about any information posted to the Conversations area and to do your own research before making any investment decisions. People writing in the Conversations area may not be who they say they are, may not know what they say they know or may not be affiliated with whom they say they are affiliated. The Conversations area of Morningstar.com is offered for entertainment purposes only. Morningstar expressly disclaims any responsible for the content or accuracy of any information posted to this area and for any trading, investment or other decisions made on the basis of this information.</p>

<p><b>Security</b><br>
Morningstar.com takes precautions to protect its members' personal information. We use industry-standard on-line security measures, such as encryption and authentication, to protect your credit card information. Please note, however, that no transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure.</p>
 <p>Morningstar.com also works to protect user information offline. All of your information is housed in secure, access-restricted areas. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific function are granted access to personally identifiable information.</p>

      <p><b>How to Control or Change Your Profile Information</b><br>
You can edit any of the personal information you've provided by visiting the <a href="http://members.morningstar.com/prism/ContactUpdate.html">Personal Profile section</a> of the Membership area. Because this information is protected, you will be required to enter your user name and password to make changes. Additionally, in the Personal Profile section, you can agree to receive special offers through regular mail from companies carefully selected by Morningstar. If you don't want this information, make sure the appropriate box is unchecked.</p> 
      <p>In the <a href="http://members.morningstar.com/prism/sub_cent_Newsletters.html">E-mail Subscription Center</a>, you can choose to receive e-mail newsletters and other communications about new features and improvements to Morningstar.com. If you don't want to be sent these communications, make certain that the appropriate boxes are left unchecked. We also include instructions on how to opt-out of receiving e-mail from Morningstar.com each time we send you a message. You can stop mail from Morningstar.com by e-mailing <a href="mailto:nomail@mail.morningstar.net">nomail@mail.morningstar.net</a>. Your name will be removed from our database within one business day. Or to immediately unsubscribe, update your Personal Profile by visiting the <a href="http://members.morningstar.com/prism/ContactUpdate.html">Personal Profile section</a> of the Membership area. Make certain the appropriate boxes are not checked.</p>

<p><b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b><br> 
If we ever change the Privacy Policy, we will post that information on this Privacy Policy page. If there is ever any material change to the information we gather and how it is used, we will notify you via the address we have in your personal profile. We invite you to come back from time to time to review the policy.</p> 
      <p>If you have any questions about Morningstar.com's privacy practices or this Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at<a href="mailto:joe@morningstar.com"> joe@morningstar.com</a>.</p>
