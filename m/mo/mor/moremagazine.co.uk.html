              <p>
                <strong>Our Commitment To Your Privacy</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Bauer Consumer Media (Bauer) is responsible for the website www.moremagazine.co.uk and is committed to protecting your privacy and security.</p>
              <p>From time to time we may invite you to supply personal information in order for us to authenticate your identity or to provide you with services (such as access to our subscriber-only services, our bulletin board, email newsletters and competitions). In order to deliver such services, we will need to process and store your personal information and may need to transfer it to the relevant partner(s), to Bauer’s for processing both inside and outside the European Economic Area (EEA). By submitting your personal information, you consent to such processing and transfers in connection with such orders, offers or services and for any other purposes to which you consent at the time you provide the information or as provided in this privacy policy "Who Else Will We Provide Your Data To?"</p>
              <p>Bauer is registered in accordance with and seeks to comply with the UK Data Protection Act 1998. We follow appropriate security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal information so as to prevent unauthorised access by third parties. We also require those parties to whom we transfer personal information to comply with the same. However, the Internet is not a totally secure medium and you acknowledge and agree that Bauer shall not be responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of personal data, except to the extent. We are required to accept such responsibility by the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
              <p>This Policy only applies to the use that we make of data provided to us via the Internet and email. Other uses may be made of data provided to Bauer in correspondence, by telephone or by other means not detailed in this Policy. These terms apply in addition to Terms &amp; Conditions Of Use for the website.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why We Need To Collect Information From You</strong>
              </p>
              <p>We will notify you as to the types of information we are collecting about you as well as the uses we intend to make of that information. We may use the information we collect about you to notify you from time to time about important new features and changes to our online services or special offers, competitions or promotions we think you'll find of interest.  </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Special Promotions</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Occasionally a third party may sponsor a promotion, offer, competition or page of the website and you may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. In those circumstances we may transfer personal information to those named third parties that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy policy will apply.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Who Else Will We Provide Your Data To?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Subject to what we say below, we will not pass on your personal details to any third party, including site sponsors or advertisers, without your consent. In order to provide goods and services to you we may need to provide your data to our agents and service providers. We may provide aggregate statistics about our users, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to our third-party partners (if any), but these statistics will not contain any information about you from which you could be identified.</p>
              <p>If you enter any competitions on this website it may be necessary for us to provide your personal information to the promoters of the competition or to others that are involved in the organisation of the competition or the prize-giving.</p>
              <p>Also, we may transfer your personal information to purchasers or subsidiaries (and potential purchasers or subsidiaries) if Bauer acquires, or is acquired by or merged with, another company. This will enable you, for example, to continue your relationship with Heat despite a change of ownership.</p>
              <p>We may also need to provide your data to our subscription and other fulfilment agents in order to provide goods or services to you.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Content Posted by You</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Of course, if you post any personal information to any bulletin boards or forums, this information will immediately be made available to other users throughout the world who may use it to send you unsolicited communications. Furthermore, in some circumstances we may display some of your personal information (such as username and age) when you post material to the website to allow users to identify each other. At the point of providing personal information, we will advise you of what information may be displayed to other users. Also, if you post any content in breach of our Terms &amp; Conditions Of Use we may inform any relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Security and possibility of international transfer.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Please note that countries outside the EEA may not have the same level of protection as countries within the EEA, but we always demand that those parties to whom we transfer data adhere to the same security procedures that we follow ourselves. By submitting your personal information, you consent to such processing and transfers in connection with such orders, offers or services and for any other purposes to which you consent at the time you provide the information.</p>
