## Candidate Privacy

  * ### Overview of candidate data

We want to explain clearly how we process the Candidate personal data that we hold.

In order to provide our recruitment services we need to collect personal data relating to our Candidates. This section of the Privacy Statement provides specific information relating to Candidates.

  * ### Candidates & Associated contacts

Our Candidates are individuals to whom we provide our services, for example advising them and assisting them to find a new career opportunity.

As a recruitment business we connect those looking for a job (“ **Candidates** ”) with businesses who are looking for Candidates (“ **Clients** ”). For the purposes of this Privacy Statement a Candidate includes:

    * an active job seeker who registers with us with the purpose of us helping them to find a job, or applies to a role that we have advertised;
    * someone who we have placed with a Client whether on a permanent or contract basis;
    * someone we identify as a potential job seeker (for more information see Sources of Personal Data);
    * for the purposes of this Privacy Statement a contractor of Morgan McKinley Group is defined as a Candidate.

An **“Associated Contact”** of a Candidate means individuals whose contact details are provided to us where, for example:

    * a Candidate may make a referral of another jobseeker;
    * a Candidate may provide the details of their emergency contacts;
    * a Candidate may provide us the details of a referee;
    * A Client Contact with whom Morgan McKinley Group has/had a Candidate on contract assignment, may provide a reference for that Candidate.

  * ### Sources of personal data

We have a large variety of sources of Candidate data. We will only ever source data that is necessary to provide services to you and in a way that would be generally expected.

We receive personal data about Candidates from a variety of sources. The primary source is from our Candidates directly. Examples of the sources of personal data of Candidates are as follows:

    * the Candidate may send their CV to us with the intention of registering with us to be informed of potential job vacancies;
    * the Candidate may apply directly to a position advertised on a Morgan McKinley Group website;
    * the Candidate may apply to a position advertised on a third party jobs website;
    * the Candidate may be sourced from publicly accessible platforms where Morgan McKinley employees are also registered users, for example LinkedIn;
    * the Candidate may be sourced from third party CV providers such as jobs websites who provide CV search facilities and where users have made their CV data available to registered customers of these sites;
    * we receive Candidate information when the Candidate interacts with our communications e.g. websites and advertisements;
    * we may receive personal data about a Candidate from nominated referees of the Candidate or from other Associated Contacts of the Candidate;
    * the Candidate may be referred to us from a Client who wishes us to payroll the Candidate as a contractor;
    * when we are providing a managed services solution to a client, the Candidate may be referred to us from a third party recruitment business which is a supplier to us for that client;
    * when we are providing a managed services solution to a client, the Candidate may be referred to us directly from that client requesting that we process their application on their behalf.

  * ### Lawful processing

We have to process personal data legally. If we look for consent we will always ensure that Candidates know what they are consenting to. We may also process personal data without consent but only if that is compliant with the GDPR and/or is in line with the reasonable expectations of Candidates and Associated Contacts.

Under the GDPR we must have a lawful basis for processing all personal data. The GDPR sets out the grounds where processing of personal data can be undertaken legally. The main grounds used by Morgan McKinley Group to process personal data are as follows:

**Contract**  
If we have a contract with a Candidate, such as a contract worker, or where the Candidate has entered into a work finding services agreement for the provision of services, we will process personal data in order to fulfil the requirements of the contract, or to undertake set up requirements prior to entering into the contract.

**Legal Obligation**  
If we have a legal obligation to process personal data, such as the payment of taxes, we will process personal data on this legal ground.

**Legitimate Interests**  
The GDPR states that we may process personal data “if necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data”. We may use legitimate interests where we do not have GDPR compliant consent, or where the information is collected indirectly about Candidates (see Sources of Personal Data).  We have assessed the scenarios where we use legitimate interests as a legal ground for processing and we consider our processing is in line with Candidate expectations and that there is a balance between our interests, and those of Candidates. Candidates may object to any processing undertaken on the grounds of legitimate interests. To find out How do you Access / Update / Delete Your Data, please read that section of our General Privacy Statement.

**Consent**  
Consent may be collected when a Candidate applies to a position advertised on our websites, or when a candidate completes our registration process (see Sources of Personal Data). Where we are unable to collect consent for a particular processing activity we will only process personal data if we have another lawful ground.

**Defence of legal claims**  
In limited circumstances and in accordance with the law we may use Candidate information in the defence of legal claims or enforcing legal rights, such as IP rights.

**Assessment of employee working capacity**  
In certain circumstances, particularly in the case of a contract worker, we may be required to assess the working capacity of that worker and we will operate under this legal ground in relation to any tests or assessments undertaken involving the processing of sensitive personal data.

  * ### Retention of candidate information

Our aim is to build lasting relationships with our Candidates and thus to contribute to long term career success and development. So our goal is to continue to engage and interact with Candidates even after they have secured a new position - for example to keep them informed of market developments, invite them to topical seminars and networking events, and to be on hand to offer advice about career planning. But, we recognise that the level of engagement we have with different Candidates will vary and so our retention policy is designed to reflect this. If we lose touch with a Candidate we recognise that the personal data we collected is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected and we won't retain it any longer.

Examples of the activities that we would consider evidence of our ongoing engagement with a Candidate and thus a reason to continue holding their data include:

    * the Candidate meeting one of our consultants, to register for new opportunities, or for example to update on their situation and seek career advice or some other professional input;
    * us sending a Candidate’s CV to a Client for consideration for a role;
    * us arranging an interview between the Candidate and a Client;
    * us exchanging email correspondence or having telephone conversations with the Candidate;
    * the Candidate interacting with us in other ways for example, clicking to open our market insights, newsletters, surveys etc.

Unless the Recruitment Services have been provided to the Candidate, such personal data will be retained for a period of twelve months following the date of the last engagement by the Candidate with any marketing communication received. If a Candidate unsubscribes to marketing communications the Candidate personal data will be deleted from the marketing database and no further marketing communications will be sent.

Specifically in relation to Recruitment Services, IT, Finance, Legal, Equal Opportunities & Diversity, personal data will be retained in accordance with the above statements unless we are required to keep it for legal reasons. It will then only be retained for the period required by law and will not be further processed for any other purpose.
