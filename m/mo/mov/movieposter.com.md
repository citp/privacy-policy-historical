**_MOVIEPOSTER.COM Privacy Policy_**

**Purpose**

The purpose of this statement is to let our customers and visitors know what information we gather and what we do with it. 

**Identifying Personal Information**

**Order Information**

We gather only that information that visitors are willing to give. Some of it is required to fill orders (like names, shipping addresses, and phone numbers) or to maintain accounts (like customer accounts and affiliate accounts) and some is requested so that we can be of better service (contact information like email addresses and phone numbers, for example).

**Email**

We keep all the email we get and send in great big files so that we can go find all the information we need about particular order histories.

We send email to customers only if it regards a particular order or inquiry, or if the customer has opted to receive promotional emails. We do not share email addresses.

**Privacy**

Movieposter.com maintains a strict privacy protocol for all customer information. We don't share, trade or sell other people's personal information. Period. We only occasionally use the information in order to update our customers on new products, services, special offers, promotions, and anything else we think might be of interest (unless you don't want us to, in which case just let us know and we won't).

**Security**

All the information you provide is transmitted encrypted. Nobody but us has access to the information once it has been received — all collected data is protected by firewalls and other means.

**Non-identifying Information**

We collect all kinds of statistics about visits to our site -- where the visitors came from, what they did and viewed during their visit, what kinds of computers and browsers they use, and where they went when they left. However, we do not (and cannot) collect any personally identifying information (names, email addresses and such) in this way.

**Cookies**

We use cookies to make our shopping cart work. Without cookies, there is no way to order from us online. We also use cookies to provide information that allows us to properly track sales under our affiliate program.

This policy is subject to change.
