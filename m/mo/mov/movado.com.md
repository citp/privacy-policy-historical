## MOVADO GROUP, INC. SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY POLICY

Movado Group, Inc. (MGI) respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, employees, business partners and others. Not only does MGI strive to collect, use and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the Policy) sets forth the privacy principles MGI follows with respect to transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and from Switzerland to the United States.

  


## SAFE HARBOR

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under EU law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States (U.S.- EU Safe Harbor). The EEA also has recognized the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection. The United States Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) of Switzerland have agreed on a similar set of principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under Swiss law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States (U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor). Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, MGI adheres to the principles set forth in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor (Safe Harbor Principles).

  


## SCOPE

This Policy applies to all personal information received by MGI in the United States from the EEA and from Switzerland, in any format, including electronic, paper or verbal.

  


## DEFINITIONS

For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:

“Agent” means any third party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, MGI or to which MGI discloses personal information for use on MGI's behalf.

“MGI” means Movado Group, Inc., its predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups in the United States.

“Personal information” means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of MGI to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information.

“Sensitive personal information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, views or activities, that concerns health or sex life, information about social security benefits, or information on criminal or administrative proceedings and sanctions other than in the context of pending proceedings. In addition, MGI will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.

  


## PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

The privacy principles in this Policy have been developed based on the Safe Harbor Principles.

**NOTICE:** Where MGI collects personal information directly from individuals in the EEA or Switzerland, it will inform them about the purposes for which it collects and uses personal information about them, the types of non–agent third parties to which MGI discloses that information, the choices and means, if any, MGI offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of personal information about them, and how to contact MGI. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to MGI, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before MGI uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.

Where MGI receives personal information from its subsidiaries, affiliates or other entities in the EEA or Switzerland, it will use and disclose such information in accordance with the notices provided by such entities and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates.

**CHOICE:** MGI will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

MGI in the U.S. particularly receives, holds and processes the following personal data from the EEA and/or Switzerland:

In connection with its retail sale activities and its after-sales service, MGI may receive, hold, and process personal information from clients within the EEA and/or Switzerland, including payment card data provided by clients for the purpose of merchandise transactions and client information relating to services agreements and watch repairs.

In addition, MGI’s goal is to provide its clients with a personalized Internet experience and deliver services that are most relevant and helpful to its users. In order to achieve these goals, MGI may collect information and process personal information during user’s visits to its web- sites and, in particular, during a user’s visit to movado.com and/or movadogroupinc.com web-sites. As a consequence, MGI may receive, hold, and process personal information from clients within the EEA and/or Switzerland while providing web-site services such as a searching listing of authorized MGI retailers. MGI’s collection and use of personal information varies based on the web-site services requested by the users and the user's choice of privacy options within the relevant web-site services.

Further MGI receives, holds, and processes personal information from employees of MGI’s wholly owned European subsidiaries, which are transferred to MGI in the U.S. for purposes of human resource administration. Any such personal information is collected and processed solely for job related purposes, for other legitimate purposes reasonably related to an individual’s employment, their performance of job responsibilities and MGI’s ability to make employment services and benefits available to them. MGI particularly collects and uses personal information for the proper management of global operations, including for payroll management, headcount, promotions and performance reviews, vacation, tax and social security withholding, enrollment in company benefit programs, stock purchase and stock incentive programs as well as other compensation plans, relocation or immigration assistance, and the mandatory compliance with all applicable labor, employment, tax and other laws. 

For sensitive personal information, MGI will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly consent (opt-in) to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

MGI will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices.

**DATA INTEGRITY:** MGI will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. MGI will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

**TRANSFERS TO AGENTS:** MGI will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, being subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (EU Data Protection Directive), being subject to Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European Commission or Swiss FDPIC adequacy finding (e.g., companies located in Canada). Where MGI has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, MGI will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.

**ACCESS AND CORRECTION:** Upon request, MGI will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, MGI will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.

**SECURITY:** MGI will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Accordingly, MGI has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security measures to safeguard and secure any personal data under MGI’s control. However, MGI cannot guarantee the security of personal data on or transmitted via the Internet.

**ENFORCEMENT:** MGI will conduct annual compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy and will have a program in place to oversee the daily functions of the privacy program. Any employee that MGI determines is in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION:** Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of personal information should be directed to the MGI Privacy Officer at the address given below. If the question or concern relates to personal information of any employees of MGI or any of MGI subsidiaries the MGI Privacy Officer will refer the matter to MGI’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources (HR Representative). MGI will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information by reference to the principles contained in this Policy. For complaints not involving human resources data and which cannot be resolved between MGI and the complainant, MGI has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). For complaints involving human resources data and which cannot be resolved between MGI and the complainant, MGI has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European data protection authorities (DPA) and to cooperate with the Swiss FDPIC in the investigation and resolution of complaints to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles.

  


## LIMITATION ON APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES

Adherence by MGI to these Safe Harbor Principles may be limited (a) to the extent required to respond to or satisfy a legal or ethical obligation; (b) to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement obligations; and (c) to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.
