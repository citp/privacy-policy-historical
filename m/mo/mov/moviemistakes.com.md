# Privacy policy

moviemistakes.com keeps no personal information on record that is not knowingly provided.

Names and e-mail addresses given when submitting entries to the site are used solely for the purpose of contacting people if issues arise in relation to their submission, and are not required from any visitor. Once a submission is entered onto the site, the contributor's e-mail address is deleted. However, the name is retained so individuals can be credited at a later date. It should be noted that if a contributor enters their e-mail address in the "name/nickname" box, then this information will **automatically** be visible on the main page for a period of time, as the list of recent contributors is automatically generated from the name/nickname field. It is each contributor's responsibility to ensure they do not enter their e-mail address in the wrong box.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
