**PRIVACY STATEMENT:**  
We at Realcomp II Ltd (hereafter referred to as “Realcomp”) are committed to the protection and security of the information provided by the visitors to MoveInMichigan.com.

Most importantly, one of our missions with this site is to afford our REALTOR® subscribers with the opportunity to connect with you, the home-selling, home-buying public that enjoy an online investigative method of research and might not otherwise have an opportunity to find a REALTOR®. 

**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT:**  
Our Web site is informational and our visitors can browse anonymously. The only time we will ask you for information will be if you choose to use one of the email functions on the site.
