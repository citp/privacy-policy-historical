**1\. Information We Collect**

**Information You Provide**  
We may collect personal information from you when you use the Services, create an account with us; place an order; make a purchase; sign up for newsletters or our email list; participate in our offers and programs including sweepstakes, contests, and surveys; or otherwise contact us.   
This personal information may include your name, email address, zip code, gender, date of birth, race, ethnicity, income level, education level, parental status, marital status, primary language spoken in the home and, if you are making a purchase, financial account information (e.g., credit card, debit card or bank account information).

**Information Automatically Collected**  
We may use cookies, web beacons, log files or other technologies to automatically collect certain information about visitors to our Site or users of our App, or interactions with our email and online or mobile advertisements. For example, we may collect information such as your browser type, your computer operating system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, mobile or unique device identifier (provided by your mobile device or wireless carrier, as applicable, including your IDFA), the domain from which you accessed the Site, viewed webpages, whether an email was opened, links that are clicked, the number of times you have viewed an ad, and whether or not you clicked on an advertisement.

**Device-Location Information**  
The App may collect precise information about the location of your device. In order to allow the App to collect real-time location information you must opt-in to this service when prompted by the App and also enable the GPS services on your mobile device. We use your location information to provide information regarding nearby theaters. You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by managing your location preferences in the "My Account" section of the App or disabling the GPS services on your mobile device. ****

**Advertising, Analytics, and Third-Party Providers**  
We may also use third party providers, such as advertisers and ad networks, to help operate our Services and such providers may also use the information collected from or about you on the Services to serve you advertisements or other promotional messages from us or third party advertisers. Some of these advertisers and ad networks may collect and use information about your device ( _e.g._ , its IP address and device identifiers), your zip code, geographic location information, audio watermarks or inaudible audio waves, and other information in order to help analyze usage and target advertising on the Service and elsewhere. This information may be collected using technology such as cookies, web beacons, embedded audio watermarks, log files, or other technologies. 

These advertisers and ad networks may collect and use the information described above to provide you with relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, your activities on the Services and other third party sites or mobile apps, interactions with our email, demographic information, or information relevant to your general location so that the advertising you see on through the Services, across other third party sites, mobile apps, or devices, via email, or through App push notifications more closely reflects your interests or geographical location. For example, the App may recognize audio watermarks that are broadcasted during a movie theater pre-show if your device is in the theater, which may then be used to send you relevant advertising through App push notifications. 

**Online Tracking** **and California Do Not Track Disclosures**

You are free to set your browser or operating system settings to limit certain tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features offered on the Service or take full advantage of all of our offerings.

**7\. Your Legal Rights**

**Arbitration**  
Movietickets.com is committed to resolving any customer concerns regarding their privacy. If you feel that your privacy may have been violated, we will attempt to directly resolve the complaint. Any complaints that are still unresolved after these direct efforts will be settled by binding arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (https://www.icdr.org) in accordance with its applicable commercial rules. Requests for arbitration may be made by either party by written notice to the other party. If, within ten (10) days of issue of the request for arbitration, the parties agree to determination of the matter by a named single arbitrator, it shall be determined by that arbitrator. If, within ten (10) days of issue of a request for arbitration, the parties do not agree on a single arbitrator for determination of a specific dispute, such dispute shall be determined by a panel of three (3) arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party, with those to appoint a third arbitrator to act as chairman of the panel.

**Class Action Waiver**  
Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. Accordingly, you and we agree that the AAA Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations do not apply to our arbitration.
