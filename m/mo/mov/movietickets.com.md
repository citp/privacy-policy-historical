7\. Additional Provisions

**Social Media**  
You also can engage with our content on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter or other third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application. We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information from your interaction with our content. 

When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our applications or websites, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards.

**Arbitration**  
Movietickets.com is committed to resolving any customer concerns regarding their privacy. If you feel that your privacy may have been violated, based on the Safe Harbor Principles, we will attempt to directly resolve the complaint. Any complaints that are still unresolved after these direct efforts will be settled by binding arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its applicable commercial rules in Palm Beach County, Florida. Requests for arbitration may be made by either party by written notice to the other party. If, within ten (10) days of issue of the request for arbitration, the parties agree to determination of the matter by a named single arbitrator, it shall be determined by that arbitrator. If, within ten (10) days of issue of a request for arbitration, the parties do not agree on a single arbitrator for determination of a specific dispute, such dispute shall be determined by a panel of three (3) arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party, with those to appoint a third arbitrator to act as chairman of the panel. The costs of the chairman of the arbitration panel, or of a single arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the parties. Each party shall pay the costs of an arbitrator appointed by that party whenever a panel of arbitrators is engaged. Each party shall be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees and related expenses, unless the arbitrator(s) award recovery of such fees and expenses to the prevailing party. 

**Class Action Waiver**  
Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. Accordingly, you and we agree that the AAA Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations do not apply to our arbitration. If, however, the law of your state would find this agreement to dispense with class arbitration procedures unenforceable, then this entire paragraph (Class Action Waiver) is unenforceable. 

**Revisions to this Privacy Statement**  
MovieTickets.com reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time. When we do, we will post the change(s) on the Site. If we change the Privacy Statement in a material way, we will provide appropriate online notice to you.
