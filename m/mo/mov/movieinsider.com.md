### About Movie Insider

Movie Insider offers an extensive selection of movie information focused on current and upcoming releases. Visitors can access numerous daily feed updates and profiles for hundreds of movies-in-production, as well as a comprehensive theatrical, DVD and Blu-ray release calendars. 

Brian Renner first launched The Movie Insider in July of 1999. As a movie fan himself, Mr. Renner aimed to maintain a website that effectively provided behind-the-scenes news from movies at each stage of production. 

Started as a small online publication, The Movie Insider grew from a thousand in the early 2000s to over one million visitors monthly.
