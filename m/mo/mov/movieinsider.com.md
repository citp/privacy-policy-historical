#### About Movie Insider®

**Movie Insider offers behind-the-scenes film information about upcoming Hollywood and independent releases. Movies are tracked and updated through all stages of film production from concept/announcement, development, production, post-production and finally to release.

Since 1999, Movie Insider has strived to provide the most up-to-date upcoming movie release schedules based on confirmed third-party announcements and reporting. 

**

Movie Insider is owned and operated by The Movie Insider LLC. 

##### History of the Site

Movie Insider was first launched on free webhost _AOL Hometown_ in July 1999 by its founder Brian D. Renner (age 13 at the time!) who had a strong passion in movies and computers. Back then, the mission of the Movie Insider website was "to keep you and everyone else up to date about the world of movies". Not long after the initial launch, Brian moved the website to _Yahoo! Geocities_ and some other free hosts, followed by its first domain name "movie-insider.com" (registered by a third-party, because Brian's mom was afraid to use a credit card online!) in July 2000. Soon after a third-party ownership issue regarding this first domain name, Brian purchased "themovieinsider.com" (his mom finally relented to letting him use her credit card!) and re-launched his website again under "themovieinsider.com" on September 10, 2000. Since 2000, the Movie Insider website has gone through numerous changes/pivots, recreations and redesigns. Many are available for review by using the [Internet Archive's WayBack Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.themovieinsider.com). 

With an [October 2010 domain arbritration case](http://domains.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/1345100.htm), Brian was granted "movieinsider.com" from a recognized domain squatter (who had picked it up in August 2000 between the registration of "movie-insider.com" [July 2000] and "themovieinsider.com" [September 2000]) and eventually moved the Movie Insider website from "themovieinsider.com" to "movieinsider.com". In 2012, Brian finally secured "movie-insider.com" again too!  Movie Insider has grown from a thousand visitors in the early 2000s to over one million visitors a month today.
