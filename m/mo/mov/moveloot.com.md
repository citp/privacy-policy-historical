  * Additional Information. Additional information that you provide to us, including through comments and feedback, emails, or answers to surveys or questionnaires that you may submit. You will also be able to access your mobile camera and photo library through our mobile site, but we will not collect photo information unless you choose to upload such information to our Services.

All information that is posted to a message board, chat area, or other public area of the Services may be shared by us with others.
  * Social Network. When you first register for the Services via a Social Network (or at a later time by changing your privacy settings), you may choose whether your activities on the Services will be published on your Social Network and visible to other Social Network users, or if your activities will only be visible to you on your Social Network. If you choose to make your activities visible to other Social Network users, your activities may be published on you Social Network, including without limitation on your Social Network news feed, timeline, and profile (as applicable). Your Social Network’s website is governed by its own Social Network’s terms of use and privacy policy, including, without limitation, privacy, password, and account security policies. We do not exercise any control over your Social Network. If you chose to connect to our Services via a Social Network, you should consult your Social Network’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for your Social Network’s privacy practices, and we are not liable for your Social Network’s misuse of personal information about you.
  * Sales and Marketing. We enter into certain select marketing relationships with advertisers, suppliers and retailers and other companies that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to users of the Services. We will share personal information or any information collected through the Services with those sales and marketing affiliates in order to help them send you information that we believe will be of interest to you. You may opt-out from having your information shared with such sales and marketing affiliates by contacting us at hello@moveloot.com.
  * Subsidiaries and Affiliates. We may share personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates for the purposes for which you provided the information or as reasonably necessary for our internal administrative and business purposes.
  * Third Party Service Providers. We work with third party service providers in connection with our offerings. Such services may include moving and logistics services, payment card processors, website hosting, marketing, website usage analytics, advertising, customer service, and monitoring and maintaining the Services. We may share personal information and non-personal information with these third parties for the purpose of enabling them to provide these services. We do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties.
  * Consent. We may share personal information in accordance with any consent you provide.
  * Required by Law. We may disclose personal information or any information collected through the Services if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to legal process, in response to a request from government officials or law enforcement authorities, or as necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of illegal activity.
  * Certain Transactions. We may disclose or transfer personal information or any information collected through the Services to third parties who acquire all or a portion of Company’s business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation, or purchase of all or a portion of our assets, or in connection with any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding brought by or against us.
  * Non-Personal Information. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of people who visited or accessed the Services, the number of profiles created by users of the Services, survey and rating information and other feedback provided by users of the Services. Such information does not identify you individually.
  * Online Advertising. We may permit third party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Service as well as on other websites or apps. Companies like Google may also use this data to provide us with analytic and demographic information about our users. Typically, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. (To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies, you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org). If you access our service on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings.
  * Do Not Track. As discussed above, we track website usage information through the use of cookies for analytic and internal purposes only. Because we do not collect this information to track you across websites over time, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser will not have any effect on our collection of cookie information for analytics or internal purposes, though it may have an effect on the collection of cookie information by third party advertising networks on our site.
