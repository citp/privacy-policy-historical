<strong><font color="#800000">V. Movoto's Do-Not-Call Policy</font></strong><br>
<p><strong>Date Updated: </strong>November 30, 2006 </p>
<p>Movoto has established and implemented the following written policy and procedures for maintaining a do-not-call list.&nbsp; It is Movoto's intent to honor anyone's do-not-call request in a systematic and timely manner.&nbsp; It is also our intent to fully comply with any and all applicable do-not-call rules as a matter of course in our routine business practices.&nbsp; These rules are generally set forth at sections 64.1200 <em>et seq </em>. of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. </p>
<p>Movoto requires our sales staff, affiliated real estate agents and other personnel to read, understand, and strictly adhere to the following rules and procedures: </p>
<p><strong>Checking Company-Specific Do-Not-Call List: </strong> Do not initiate any call to any home or cell phone number for the purpose of soliciting business unless you first check client Contact Restrictions on the Movoto client administration tool.&nbsp; There is no exception to this rule for calls made based on written permission, established business relationship, or personal relationship.&nbsp; If you do not have a copy of or access to Movoto-specific do-not-call list, inform Movoto immediately. </p>
<p><strong>Honoring Do-Not-Call Requests: </strong> If the purpose of your call is to solicit business, you must refrain from calling anyone's home or cell phone number listed on Movoto do-not-call list.&nbsp; Honor any do-not-call request for five years, unless the person asks to be removed.&nbsp; Do not share Movoto's do-not-call list with anyone outside Movoto. </p>
<p><strong>Verbal or Written Do-Not-Call Requests: </strong> If anyone you speak with over the telephone or in person requests for Movoto to refrain from calling that person or if you receive a do-not-call request by mail, fax, e-mail or any other method, you must immediately update the following information in the Movoto Client Record: (1)&nbsp;the person's name, if provided; (2) the person's&nbsp;home and/or cell phone number(s) to be included in the do-not-call request; (3)&nbsp;the date and time of the do-not-call request; and (4) set "Contact Restrictions" to "Do Not Call This User".&nbsp; Your immediate attention in this matter is essential because Movoto must honor the do-not-call request within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of the request. </p>
<p><strong>Our Affiliated Entities: </strong> A do-not-call request applies to Movoto and our affiliated agents for the purposes of Movoto initiated business contact. </p>
<p><strong>Any Questions? </strong> If you have any questions or concerns about the do-not-call rules, bring it immediately to the attention Movoto Customer Care.<br>
