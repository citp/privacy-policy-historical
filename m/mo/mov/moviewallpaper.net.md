1\. What information we collect.

We may collect Personal Information from you or from other sources. **“Personal Information”** generally means information that might reasonably be used to specifically identify you and may include information such as:

  * Contact information, such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number and/or mobile number;
  * Demographic information such as gender, job information and company information;
  * Age and/or date of birth;
  * User name and password; and
  * Location data that describes the precise geographic location of your device (“Precise Location Data”).



We do not intentionally collect data such as financial information or data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership.

We also collect other kinds of information from you or other sources, which we refer to as **“Other Information”** in this Privacy Policy. The type of information we collect may change as technologies evolve. Other Information may include, but is not limited to, information such as:

  * Areas or topics of interest;

  * Browsing history, including the websites or other services you visited before and after visiting the Services;
  * Device type, settings and software used;
  * Device identification ( **“ID”** ), which is a distinctive number associated with a smartphone or similar handheld device, but is different than a hardware serial number;
  * Advertising ID, which is a unique, user-resettable identification number for advertising associated with a device (e.g. iOS uses the Identifier for Advertising (or **“IDFA”** ) and Android uses Google Advertising ID);
  * Internet connection means, such as internet service provider ( **“ISP”** ), mobile operator, WiFi connection, service set identifier ( **“SSID”** ), International Mobile Subscriber Identity ( **“IMSI”** ) and International Mobile Equipment Identity ( **“IMEI”** );
  * Internet Protocol ( **“IP”** ) address, which is a unique string of numbers automatically assigned to your device whenever you access the Internet;
  * Log files, which may include IP addresses, browser type, ISP referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps and/or clickstream data, including any clicks on customized links;
  * Web Beacons, which are electronic files that allow a website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies;
  * Pixel Tags, also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user’s computer to a third party website;
  * Non-precise information about the approximate physical location (for example, at the city or zip code level) of a user’s computer or device derived from the IP address of such computer or device (“GeoIP Data”);
  * Local Shared Objects, such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage, such as HTML5;
  * Mobile analytics to understand the functionality of our mobile applications and software on your phone; and
  * Information collected through the use of cookies, eTags, Javascript, pixel tags, device ID tracking, anonymous identifiers and other technologies, including information collected using such methods and technologies about (i) your visits to, and interaction and engagement with, the Services and ads on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels, and (ii) your interaction with emails including the content and ads (collectively, **“Online Data”** ).



We may also supplement the Personal Information and Other Information we collect from you with information from third parties, including third party affiliate network operators, referral sources, social networking sites or services (such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn), and commercially available or public sources (such as data brokers, data aggregators and public databases). If you use a third party connection or log-in (such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google+) to create a membership or profile on any part of the Services, access our content or forward our content to another person, platform or service, we may also receive your user name, password or email address for those third party services or other information available about you or collected from you on those services. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of third parties, including those that may disclose information to Ziff Davis.

**All of the above information is referred to collectively as “User Information”.**

Please note that Ziff Davis is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the discussions in certain public areas of the site, such as forums, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, private messages, message boards or other publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make public in your member profile or other areas that allow users to upload or post content. We discourage users from posting Personal Information in this fashion. You can change your publicly available information at any time via your profile page or to request removal of your Personal Information from these areas. Please see our section on How you can change or control what is collected in this Privacy Policy. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

2\. How we collect and use information.

Ziff Davis collects information as described herein. All information is or may be used as described in this Privacy Policy.

We collect User Information across our Services, such as when you register for site membership or create a profile or account on any part of the Services; purchase a subscription, software license or product; sign up for emails, newsletters, bulletins, webinars or white papers; enter a sweepstakes, contest, competition or prize draw; receive promotional information by SMS text message; participate in surveys; perform search queries on the Services; or otherwise communicate with us. We also collect User Information about you offline through telephone or direct mail efforts or from customers, vendors, suppliers, third parties and publicly-available sources.

When you use the Services, we may combine Personal Information with Other Information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and to improve the functionality of the Services and our ability to market or advertise to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. We may also combine information you have provided to us with information obtained from other sources.

Personal Information is used to provide Services to you from Ziff Davis or its partners, which includes, but is not limited to when: (i) we send emails or newsletters offering services or products to you, (ii) you post your personal testimonial alongside other endorsements, (iii) we display your personal reviews of products or services, or (iv) you to search for other website members using information you may already know about that member such as username, full name or gamer profile and identify users matching that criteria. Personal Information may also be used to send you advertisements and promotions on the Services and on third party channels. Personal Information you provide to us is used in a way that is compatible with the Services and this Privacy Policy. Some of the Services use Personal Information of a registered user to “pre-populate” online forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting additional information about you by the Services or on behalf of a third party.

If you choose to use our referral service to send an article to a contact or to invite a contact to become a member of a website, we will ask you for your contact’s email address or allow you to import your contacts from your email account’s address book. We will automatically send your contact a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website. We may collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts, and will only use that information for that purpose.

Ziff Davis and its partners use cookies and other tracking technologies to analyze trends, administer Services, track users’ movements around the Services and on third party sites, devices and applications, and to gather demographic information about our user base. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the Services. To manage Flash cookies, please click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). Please see our [Cookie Policy](http://www.ziffdavis.com/cookie-policy) for more information, including a more in-depth explanation of what cookies are, the different types of cookies used on the Services, and how to change or delete them.

Tracking technologies on the Services may be deployed by Ziff Davis and/or by our service providers or partners. Certain tracking technologies enable us to assign a unique identifier to you, and relate information about your use of the Services to other information about you, including your User Information. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times and use such information along with offline and online information obtained from other sources (including from third parties), including, but not limited to, demographic information and updated contact information for the purposes of learning more about you so we can provide you with relevant content and advertising.

When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use web beacons, customized links, clear GIFs or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information, and/or aggregate with other data we collect for some or all of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

We and our partners (including e-commerce partners, affiliates, and analytics providers) may also use technologies such as pixel tags, e-tags, IP addresses, Local Shared Objects, Local Storage, Flash cookies and HTML5 to analyze trends; administer the Services; collect and store information such as user settings, anonymous browser identifiers and video viewing history; supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement; track users’ location and movements around the Services; gather demographic information about our user base; and to improve our understanding of traffic on the Services, visitor behavior, and responses to promotional campaigns. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these third party companies on an individual and aggregated basis. For example, we may connect information about your IP address to known corporate or other information or User Information and use the associated information related to aggregate content preferences to assist in our efforts to market services to you or the originating corporation(s). Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing Local Storage. To manage Flash Local Shared Objects please click [here](http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

We use mobile analytics software to collect data and to better understand the functionality of our mobile software, devices and applications on your phone and other devices. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We may link this information to User Information.

The Services include certain social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, which include the “Share” button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Services. These features may collect your IP address, track which page you are visiting on the Services, and may serve a cookie to enable the features to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

3\. Information regarding interest-based advertising.

Ziff Davis and/or certain third parties collect information about you for online behavioral advertising (“ **OBA** ”) purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels. OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising.

Ziff Davis displays ads on both the Services and on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels (collectively, “ **Channels** ”). We use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA. For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.

**The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change.** For a list of some of the applicable providers, [click here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?type=ziffdavispop&pid=ziffdavis01&aid=ziffdavis01). For information about how to opt out of tracking methods for these entities and others, [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). For more details about OBA and opting out, click here.

Online Data is aggregated with the other information and data we collect as described in this Privacy Policy and/or similar data collected by partners to create groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data and GeoIP Data, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using the Services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services. We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests. We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your Personal Information.

We may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.

We engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. We do not authorize such third party providers to collect Personal Information from our Services for their own purposes. Except as may be set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, this Online Data is retained by Ziff Davis for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire. However, the 180 day period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits or interacts with an ad, email, the Services or a Channel.

We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them. We may share your User Information with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier. Our partners may also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system; (ii) combine User Information about you received from Ziff Davis with information about you from other sites or services; and (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

Our ad network partners may use cookies, web beacons and advertising IDs to collect information about your activities on the Services and Channels to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria. If you wish to not have this information used by Ziff Davis or vendors collecting OBA data on the Services for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served all advertising. If you opt out of interest-based ads, you will continue to receive ads, but these ads may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser, reset your advertising ID, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out settings.

4\. What information we give to third parties.

Ziff Davis provides User Information to third party companies and contractors who work on our behalf to provide us with specialized services, such as email message deployment, email address validation, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses), subscription fulfillment, customer support and service, research, statistical analysis, cross-device user tracking, data and website hosting, marketing, advertising, and other data and transaction processing. These companies work on our behalf, are authorized by Ziff Davis to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service, and are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information. We also engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing the sale of subscriptions, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, or other services. These service providers have access to or are provided with certain Personal Information (including credit card information) in order to provide us with the applicable service.

At times, we conduct contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, or produce and host sponsored white papers, webcasts or other downloads for a variety of companies (“Sponsors”). Information collected during the registration for such events is used by us as part of User Information, and may be shared with the Sponsor and others. The information collected would be subject to our Privacy Policy and, in the event that it is shared with a Sponsor or other third party, would also be subject to the Sponsor’s or such other third party’s privacy policy, and it may be used by us, the Sponsor, and/or such other third parties for follow up purposes. We may also share your information with third party vendors involved in the administration of such events. For contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, please read the official rules or terms and conditions carefully before you submit your information.

For some of our Services, we may make some information, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer’s name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g. sale) to third party providers of goods and services, for example, when such information is provided in connection with webcasts, white papers or other sponsored downloads. While many customers appreciate the communications they receive from the third party providers of goods and services to whom we provide lists of our customers, if you no longer wish to receive messages from individual providers, follow the unsubscribe link and instructions at the bottom of the provider’s message or contact the third party provider directly to be removed from their list.

When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Ziff Davis), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that partner. This may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services. Use of your information by such partners may be subject to their privacy policies as well as ours.

In order to help us sell advertising on the Services and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and its brands, we may share aggregate statistics that describe our online audience. Those statistics are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse the Services and describe, among other things, the demographics of our visitors.

We may also disclose User Information that we receive from you and from third party and public sources to third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, content publishers and retailers) that want to market products or services to you. In addition, we provide information to third parties for OBA as discussed above.

Ziff Davis and some of our advertisers use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements and perform related services when you visit the Services. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookie and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.

5\. How you can change or control what is collected.

_Updating Your Registration Information._  Upon request, Ziff Davis will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal Information. You can also view, correct, delete or change the information collected during user registration at any time at the profile page for that membership, app or website. Please allow five to ten business days for corrections or changes to be publicly displayed or implemented throughout our systems. If you have any trouble accessing, correcting or deleting any of your information, or would like to make a request about whether Ziff Davis holds any of your Personal Information, please contact the website directly by clicking on the appropriate link below (which should lead to a “Contact Us” page or support email) or contact us at [ZDLegal1@ziffdavis.com](mailto:ZDLegal1@ziffdavis.com)  **(must include “Privacy Policy” in the subject line)**  and we will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

_OBA_. Ziff Davis is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance ( **“DAA”** ) in the U.S., E.U. and Canada and uses third party assurance platforms to comply with the DAA principles. Online ads on the Services using Online Data are delivered with the DAA Ad Marker Icon [](http://youradchoices.com/), which helps users understand how their data is being used and provides choices for users who want more control. This icon is also on each of our web pages and applications where Online Data is collected that will be used for OBA purposes.

The DAA Ad Marker Icon [](http://youradchoices.com/) provides information (and links to other information) on online behavioral ads, who is collecting and using your Online Data, how you can opt out and more. If you would prefer that we not collect Online Data that may be used to help determine which advertisements to serve you, opt out by clicking this icon [](http://youradchoices.com/), which can be found on most of our webpages and mobile applications.

_Cookies and Pixel Tags_. You may stop or restrict cookies and pixel tags on your computer or purge cookies from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. However, if you “turn off,” purge, or disable cookies or pixel tags, although you may still use the Services, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions, or services available on the Services.

_Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions_. You can opt out or unsubscribe to a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some Services, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list.

_Push Notifications_. We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.

_**California Residents**_. In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, we may collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use the Services. While we give our users many avenues to opt out of providing Personal Information, we do not respond to Web browsers’ “do not track” signals. If you wish for us to refrain from gathering your Personal Information, please see our section on How to Change or Control What Is Collected. California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our users who are California residents to periodically request and obtain certain information about any Personal Information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes.

However, we cannot guarantee there will not be a breach, and we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any third parties. In certain instances we may use Secure Sockets Layer encryption and/or transfer certain User Information in a non-human readable format to provide protection. You are ultimately responsible for the security of your email address and password.

No one under age 13 should provide any Personal Information or use our public discussion areas, forums or chats. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases on the Service or obtaining coupons or codes from the Services to purchase goods or services on third party websites.

If it is discovered that we have collected Personal Information from someone under 13, we will delete that information immediately.

_Data Retention_. The time period for which we keep information varies according to the information’s use. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period.

Ookla

Ookla is a Ziff Davis company and operator of Speedtest.net, Speedtest Custom and Pingtest.net, as well as the Speedtest applications. Speedtest by Ookla is also offered on multiple devices, products and platforms, such as an extension on your web browser or as an application in certain products such as routers.

When conducting a test through Speedtest on any device or platform, we collect: (a) the test results; (b) non-precise information about the approximate physical location of your computer or device derived from the IP address of such computer or device **(“GeoIP Data”)** , and/or location data that describes the precise geographic location of your device **(“Precise Location Data”)** (if your mobile device settings allow it); and (c) other information, including, but not limited to, the IP address, the ISP, college or organization that operates the network you test, and network, hardware and device identifiers such as your SSID or IMEI (if the test is conducted on a smartphone). If you install Speedtest on your smartphone or other mobile device, Ookla may collect your Precise Location Data, both while you are running a test and when the application is not actively in use but is running in the background on your device. To turn off the background scanning feature of the Speedtest application, go to the settings or coverage maps features within the Speedtest application and switch the background scanning feature to “Off.” If your smartphone or mobile device settings do not allow transmittal of Precise Location Data, certain features may not be available or their functions may be limited. 

Except as otherwise described herein, the information we gather from all tests run through Ookla’s brands is collected anonymously and then aggregated to provide performance data to users on the Ookla websites and/or to third parties to whom we license the information. We do so with the express intent of providing a neutral and unbiased monitoring and reporting resource for users around the world. The only Speedtest results we do not license to third parties are those test results from instances of Speedtest Custom which have a paid subscription– in such instances, the Speedtest results are owned by the subscriber and are subject to that subscriber’s privacy policy. 

Information collected through Speedtest may not be anonymous as follows: In most cases, the IP addresses collected when you run a test on Speedtest.net, the Speedtest applications, or through the Speedtest feature of the browser extension are masked or partially hidden, but in some cases we provide the full IP address to the company licensing the information. For some ISPs and mobile carriers, Ookla will provide full IP addresses and/or network, hardware or device identifiers, for such ISP or mobile carrier’s customers upon request. Ookla may also provide full IP addresses and/or network, hardware and device identifiers, to equipment manufacturers and core network, or wholesale, providers on a case-by-case basis for network research purposes. Ookla may also collect GeoIP Data and/or Precise Location Data, and such data may also be licensed and/or transferred to third parties.
