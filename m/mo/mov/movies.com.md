# Privacy Policy | Fandango

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Fandango Media, LLC and its subsidiary companies, including the businesses operating under the Fandango, FandangoNOW, Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster, Movieclips, Movies.com, Activaterewards.com, or M-GO brands ("Fandango", "we", "our" or "us"), with respect to how we collect, use, disclose and transfer the information you provide when you interact with us via those of our websites, applications, emails and other communications that link to or reference this policy (the "Online Services"); this privacy policy does not apply to other communications that you may have with us outside of the Online Services or information that we obtain from third parties. 

When the Online Services receive or collect information, that information is being received and collected, and will be owned, by Fandango and each of "Fandango's Owners" (i.e., each company that owns an ownership interest in Fandango). While Fandango's use, handling, disclosure and practices with respect to that information will be governed by this Privacy Policy, each Fandango Owner's use, handling, disclosure and practices with respect to that information will be governed by that Fandango Owner's privacy policy. Fandango's Owners are currently NBC/Universal and Warner Bros. If you want to learn more about the privacy practices of NBC/Universal and Warner Bros., we encourage you to review their policies (linked below): 

**Your use of our websites and our other services are subject to binding individual arbitration of any disputes which may arise, as provided in the[Terms and Policies](https://web.archive.org/policies/terms-and-policies). Please read the arbitration provisions of the [Terms and Policies](https://web.archive.org/policies/terms-and-policies) carefully and do not use the Online Services if you are unwilling to arbitrate any disputes you may have with us as provided in our [Terms and Policies](https://web.archive.org/policies/terms-and-policies).**

##### 1\. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

There are two main types of information we collect about users of the Online Services: 

  * **"Personally Identifiable Information"** is information that identifies you, and may include for example your full (i.e., first and last) name, phone number, email address, postal address, or credit or other payment card number, and photos of you or other individuals. 
  * **"Non-Personally Identifiable Information"** is information that relates to you or your computer or device but does not on its own identify you. Non-Personally Identifiable Information relates to information about you, or the computer or mobile device you use to access the online Services, but doesn't identify you personally. This information may include (for example), information about your use of the Online Services, including web pages you have visited, apps you have downloaded, parts or functions of the Online Services you have used or viewed, gameplay data, content you have accessed or viewed, advertising sent to you or that you have viewed, transaction history, IP address and device identifiers, information about your Internet connection, information about the equipment or software you use to access the Online Services, and information you provide to or post on message boards or chat rooms that are part of the Online Services. 



##### 2\. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM YOU

We collect information about you in three main ways:

  * **_Directly from you, when you provide it to us:_** for example, when you register with the website, download an app, sign up for email or text alerts, buy movie tickets or make other purchases via the Online Services, request products or services, respond to surveys, contact us or otherwise interact with us. Please remember that if others use devices into which you remain logged in, they may share information with us as if they were you, and they may have access to information that you have previously provided us. To protect your privacy, please log out from the Online Services you use on shared devices.
  * **_Automatically, when you use our Online Services_** : we collect information through the use of cookies and similar technologies, through logging your activities on the Online Services, and when you download our mobile applications. Please see our [Cookies and Tracking Technologies Information Center](https://web.archive.org/policies/cookies-and-tracking), and [Mobile Apps Information Center](https://web.archive.org/mobileterms) for further information, including your choices in relation to the use of these technologies.
  * **_From third parties_** : we may obtain information about you from third parties outside of the Online Services—this Privacy Policy will not apply to that information. When you sign-on to the Online Services or otherwise interact with social networks or if you interact with us through a social media function such as a plug-in (for example, a Facebook "like" button) then you may be permitting us to have on-going access to some information from your social network profile (such as your name, email address, your friend list, photo, age, gender, location, birthday, social networking ID, current city, the people/sites you follow, and so forth). We may also obtain information about you from a third party data aggregator, cookie technology operator, advertising network, or another type of data company. 



##### 3\. HOW WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

We (and our service providers) may use the information we collect about you for a variety of business purposes. For example, we may use that information to:

  * Provide the services and products you have requested;
  * Create an account on the Online Services if you have requested one;
  * Personalize the services we offer and the advertising displayed through the Online Services (see options for opting-out of personalized advertising at our [Cookies and Tracking Technologies Information Center](https://web.archive.org/policies/cookies-and-tracking));
  * Respond to your inquiries, requests, and comments;
  * Allow you to participate in the interactive features of our Online Services, where you choose to do so;
  * Provide technical support for the Online Services;
  * Understand how the Online Services are used so that we can continuously improve the services we provide to you;
  * Send you service-related communications, including announcements and administrative messages;
  * Send you newsletters and information about products, services and promotions relating to us or other companies or organizations that we work with. 
  * Use technology (such as Facebook Custom Audiences) to deliver advertising to you on other sites based on the email address or other Personally Identifiable Information you provided to us or through the use of information we received from third parties. Please see Your Rights and Choices for further information about how you can control these updates;
  * Send gifts to your requested recipients, provide other communications relating to those sorts of transactions, as well as any further communications as may be authorized by the recipients; and
  * Combine all the information we collect or receive about you for any of the foregoing purposes.



##### 4\. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as aggregate data and information about your use of the Online Services with third parties. We may also share information about you as disclosed at the time you provide that information, as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and in the following circumstances: 

  * **_Fandango's Owners and Subsidiaries:_** As stated at the beginning of this Privacy Policy, when the Online Services receive or collect information from you, that information is being received and collected by Fandango under this Privacy Policy, as well as by each of Fandango's Owners, each under its own respective privacy policy. Fandango's Owners are currently NBC/Universal and Warner Bros. If you want to learn more about the privacy practices of NBC/Universal and Warner Bros., we encourage you to review their policies (linked below): 
    * [NBC/Universal Privacy Policy](http://www.nbcuniversal.com/privacy)
    * [Warner Bros. Privacy Policy](http://www.warnerbros.com/privacy-center-wb-privacy-policy)
  * **_Service providers that we have retained to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf:_** For example, our service providers may offer services such as research, analytics, hosting websites, fulfilling transactions, maintaining databases, administering contests, providing technology services and platforms, deliveries, and processing payments. Typically, when these companies are provided with Personally Identifiable Information they are only provided with that Personally Identifiable Information they need to perform their functions and that Personally Identifiable Information can only be used as is necessary to perform the services on our behalf, or to comply with legal requirements. Similarly, where appropriate, we often take steps to require third-party service providers to protect Personally Identifiable Information.
  * **_Theaters, Venue Operators, Event Promoters:_** We may provide information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to theaters, venue operators and event promoters so that they can admit you to their premises (or to the premises of their events), or be prepared to handle issues relating to your attendance or planned attendance. 
  * **_Loyalty Program Operators_ :** Our services offer the ability for consumers to link their Fandango account with the loyalty rewards programs of certain theaters, venue operators, event promoters, movie studios or other companies offering loyalty reward programs. When you indicate that you'd like such a link to occur, we may share transaction information or other information (including Personally Identifiable Information) pertaining to you with the applicable program operator. 
  * **_Social Networks:_** You may interact with certain features of the Online Services that cause information to be published to your social networks. Or, you may sign up for features on the Online Services or a social network that are designed to require that we provide to the social network, or the social network provide to us, information, which may include Personally Identifiable Information, to associate our records relating to you in our data base with the records that social network has relating to you in their database, so that they or we can contact you or tailor messages to you, or otherwise. On pages of the Online Services that contain social network functionality, the social network providing the functionality may be able to collect information about you, even if you don't use that functionality.
  * **_Message Boards and Other Public Areas:_** Information you provide to or post on message boards, chat rooms or other public areas that are part of the Online Services may be freely used and disclosed by us. 
  * **_For Mobile, Consumer Electronics or Other Device Apps:_** We may share information (including Personally Identifiable Information and how you use mobile apps, consumer electronics device apps or other device apps) with mobile carriers, technology providers, analytics providers, device makers or operators, or the operators of platforms, operating systems or other mobile, consumer electronics or other device apps. Please see our Mobile Apps Information Center for additional details about mobile apps.
  * **_Opt-Ins:_** In some places on our Online Services we may place opt-ins where you can select to receive communications from companies with whom we have promotional relationships. If you opt-in to receive those communications, or opt-in to consent to share Personally Identifiable Information with them, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to them.
  * **_Contests and Sweepstakes:_** We may publicly disclose the name, city and state of contest and sweepstakes winners if permitted by the contest/sweepstakes rules. 
  * **_Sale of Our Business or Assets:_** If we sell all or part of our business or assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign any or all information to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction. Upon such a transfer, the privacy policies of the acquiring entity may govern the further collection and use of Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
  * **_Legal Reasons:_** We may use or disclose information to cooperate with or enlist the support of law enforcement, government or regulatory bodies, content protection organizations or judicial processes with respect to, or to prevent, suspected or possible fraud or other suspected or possible illegal activities. We may also use or disclose information as we determine appropriate to the extent that records have been subpoenaed or otherwise in connection with pending or potential litigation, or to enforce or protect the rights or safety of Online Services users, us or others, or for risk management purposes.



**_A Special Note About Sharing Video Viewing Information:_** By using the Online Services, you are agreeing that we may share information about the video content viewed on your device through the Fandango Services with the analytics providers, advertising companies, third-party social media sites, and the other service providers we work with (as described in this Privacy Policy). If you have registered, you may withdraw your consent to sharing of personally identifiable viewing information associated with content viewed by sending an email to [privacy@fandango.com](mailto:privacy@fandango.com). You may also be able to control information shared with third parties, such as social media sites, through your privacy settings on those services.

##### 5\. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

We may work with third party ad networks and consumer data companies to help present ads through the Online Services or to help us evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Online Services and viewing of our ads and other content. These third parties may view, edit or set their own tracking technologies/cookies, which will allow them to collect information about how you interact with content and advertising while you are using the Online Services and while you are on other third party platforms where their tracking technologies are located. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. 

If you do not want to receive the benefits of targeted advertising, you may opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by visiting the [NAI Opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or the [DAA Opt-out page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you. Please note that if you opt-out of targeted advertising, we may still track your visits to the Online Services for our own analytics, operations and security purposes

For more information about your choices relating to these activities, see [Cookies and Tracking Technologies Information Center](https://web.archive.org/cookies-and-tracking).

##### 6\. CHILDREN

The Online Services are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, and thus if you are under 13 we ask that you do not use the Online Services or provide us with any information. If we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information then we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under 13 has provided us with information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@fandango.com](mailto:privacy@fandango.com). 

California minors under 18 years old may request the removal of any information that they posted to the Online Services by contacting [privacy@fandango.com](mailto:privacy@fandango.com). Upon such request, we will anonymize or remove from public view any content posted by a minor to one of the Online Services, unless required by law to retain such content or information.

**7\. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION**

We maintain procedural, technical and physical safeguards for the Online Services to help protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide via the Online Services. Unfortunately, no transmission of data is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. Therefore, any transmission of Personally Identifiable Information to us is made at your own risk.
