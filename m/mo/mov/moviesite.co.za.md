# The MovieSite — Privacy Policy

We value your privacy. 

We hate spam just as much as you do. 

So we do not and will not release your email address or any other personal details to anyone else outside this web site without your permission. 

Your email address is used only for sending out the regular mailings about updates to this site, if you subscribed. Email addresses supplied when you submit a movie rating are sometimes used to verify that it was indeed you who submitted an opinion, and then deleted. 

Any personal information collected (in competition entries, for example) is used solely for statistical purposes. If we have a good idea of the ages, genders, etc. of our visitors, we can tailor the content better for you. 

Note however that if you supply your age when submitting a movie review or rating, we will include your age next to your name if we publish your rating or review. This is so that other visitors can better judge whether your comment or rating has relevance for them or not. If you are sensitive about your age, and for some reason are convinced that you are the only individual in the whole universe with your particular first name and surname combination, then do not include it when submitting a rating or review.
