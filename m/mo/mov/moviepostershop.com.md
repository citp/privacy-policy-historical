# Movie Posters, Photos and Picture Art – MoviePosterShop.com

Security  
When you shop at the Movie Poster Shop, our secure server encrypts all of your personal information, including name, address and credit card information. Our industry standard encryption ensures no one can access or use your personal information.

Privacy  
We know your privacy is important to you and Movie Poster Shop is committed to protecting your information.  
When you place an order, we will ask for your contact information (i.e., name, shipping address, and e-mail address) and, if you are paying by credit card, financial information (like credit card number and expiration date.) We have partnered with a credit card processing company to assist us in processing your payment; however, that company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. The information you provide us is used for processing and fulfilling your order and contacting you if we have any problems processing your order.

In addition, Movie Poster Shop, like almost all large e-commerce Web sites, uses "cookies". Cookies are bits of information that are stored on your computer by your Web browser. Although our cookies don not store any of your private information, they do allow us to do things like keep items in your shopping cart between visits or during the same visit. Whether you want your Web browser to accept cookies or not is up to you. If you have not changed your computer settings, most likely your browser already accepts cookies.

Our Commitment:  
Movie Poster Shop is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the personal information you provide only for order processing. You may, from time to time, receive information from us about new features, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. Under no circumstances do we rent, trade or share your e-mail address with any other company for marketing purposes.

Choice to opt-out:  
If you are no longer interested in receiving announcements and other marketing information from us, please e-mail your request to [mail@moviepostershop.com](mailto:mail@moviepostershop.com). Please include your complete name and mailing address (as well as your e-mail address) if you prefer not to receive direct mail postcards or catalogs from us.

Updating your personal information:  
If your personal information changes, we provide you a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you provided to us. You can make necessary changes by contacting our customer service department via e-mail at: [mail@moviepostershop.com](mailto:mail@moviepostershop.com).

When you shop at Movie Poster Shop, our secure server encrypts all of your personal information (including name, address and credit card information) before it gets to us, and protects it against any unauthorized access. All secure pages are earmarked by an "https" address instead of an "http" address. All our pages that have an "https" address are secure and protected (e.g. while you place an order).

Notification of changes:  
If we decide to change our privacy policy in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting a notice on our web site. Those changes will go into effect on the date posted in the notice. The new policy will apply to all current and past users of our web site and will replace any prior policies that are inconsistent.  
Your Agreement:  
By using our website or purchasing a product from us, you agree to the collection and use of information as set forth in this privacy policy.
