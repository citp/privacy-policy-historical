The information we need:  
When you place an order, we will ask for your contact information (i.e., name, shipping address, and e-mail address) and, if you are paying by credit card, financial information (like credit card number and expiration date.)

The information you provide us is used for processing and fulfilling your order and contacting you if we have problems processing your order.  
Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law and when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.  
What we do with your information: The private information that you give us when you place an order or utilize one of our special services is used to process and fulfill your order or request.
