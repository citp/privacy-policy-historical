Anonymous data is information (originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may collect anonymous data whether or not you are a registered member of Movieclips. We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis.

Movieclips may share this type of anonymous data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers, and other current and prospective business partners. Movieclips may use anonymous data collected for website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes.

Movieclips may also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant.
