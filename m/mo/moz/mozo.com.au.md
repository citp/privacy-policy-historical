Where we ask for personal information we clearly outline the purpose for which the information is collected and how we will use your information and to whom it may be disclosed.

By providing personal information to Mozo on our website or via the phone, you authorise and consent to Mozo collecting, using, storing and disclosing personal information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. 

If you request that your personal information is passed onto another entity by using our Services we will share your personal information with that third party. Once we disclose your personal information to a third party we are no longer responsible for the conduct or practices of those third party providers, as they are not under our control. When you are contacted by a third-party you should check the applicable privacy policy of that third party. 

We use third party service providers in order to provide the Services to you and in doing so may make your information available to certain third party service providers. These services include website hosting, mailing list providers, CRM software, accounting software, web analytics software, ad serving and online marketing software. These providers may be located in a range of different countries including Australia and the United States. We take all steps which are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that these organisations both inside and outside of Australia deal with personal information according to this Privacy Policy and do not breach the Australian Privacy Principles in relation to the information. 

We may also use the information provided by you on an anonymous basis where your personal information is not identifiable and we may use this for any purpose or share it with third parties. We mainly use your information on this basis in relation to our market research services, measuring the way that our Services are being used and the publishing of customer reviews information on the site. We may also provide this information to 3rd parties to allow them to serve relevant advertisements to you. 

## How do we protect your information? 

Mozo will act to protect your personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles using commercially reasonable administrative and technical measures to safeguard and protect this information. We are committed to keeping the personal information you provide to us secure. We take all reasonable precautions to protect the personal information we hold about you from misuse and loss and from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. 

We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed for the purpose for which the information was disclosed or lawfully required. 

We will only collect your personal information by lawful and fair means. 

## Accessing or correcting your information 

We provide you with easy access to the personal information we hold about you. Once you register you can easily access and change your personal information by contacting Mozo directly. If you require details of your personal information held by us, we will need to verify your identity before meeting your request, which we will process in a reasonable time. 

If the information we hold about you is inaccurate, irrelevant, misleading, incomplete or outdated, inform us so that we can promptly correct it. 

If you no longer wish to receive email communications from us, you can unsubscribe at any time by using the link on the emails we send you, or informing us and we will do it for you. Our marketing communications will provide you with details of how to opt-out. 

You can delete cookies from your computer at any time via your internet browser. However doing so will limit your use of some of Mozo's features. 

When your personal information is no longer needed, or if it not collected from you personally and it would not be lawful for us to collect it, we will remove any personal identifiers or we will ensure the secure destruction of the records. 

As far as permissible under law, Mozo accepts no responsibility for the unauthorised access of personal information held by Mozo.
