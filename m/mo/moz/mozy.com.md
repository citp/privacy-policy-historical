# Privacy | Mozy

This Privacy Policy explains the practices and policies of Mozy, Inc. and subsidiaries regarding the collection and protection of Personal Data supplied by users or collected by us from users of Mozy websites, including Mozy.com, MozyPro.com, MozyEnterprise.com and the MozyHome, MozyPro, and MozyEnterprise backup services (the "Service").

Mozy defines "Personal Data" as any data from which it is practical to directly determine the identity of an individual. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in the Service's License and Service Agreement (the "User Agreement"). This Privacy Policy may be updated by Mozy from time to time. Mozy will provide notice of materially significant changes to the Privacy Policy by posting notice on its websites.

By registering to use the Service, you agree (1) to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and (2) Mozy may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy or the User Agreement. Personal Data may be processed by Mozy in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent.

## How Mozy Uses Information

**Personal Data**

We **will not** sell or market the email addresses or other collected personal information of registered Users to third parties.  
We **will not** view the files that you backup using the Service.  
We **may** view your file system information (file extensions, sizes, etc., but not your file contents) to provide technical support.

You acknowledge and agree that Mozy may occasionally send you administrative communications regarding your account or the Service via email.

**Cookies and Passive Data Collection**

Mozy uses cookie, IP address, and URL information to improve and further develop the Service, and to provide enhanced or geographically differentiated features and service levels to Users, where available. Mozy uses cookies to save User screen names, session validators, and on Users' browsers and hard drives, and may use them to provide tailored products and services to those Users, as they become available.

IP Addresses also help us diagnose network congestion, problems with our servers and otherwise assist in the administration and delivery of the Service to our Users.

Third-party vendors, including Google, show your Mozy ads on sites on the Internet. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at [http://www.google.com/privacy/ads. ](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads. "http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/")

## User Information Mozy Collects

**Personal Data**

Once you register with Mozy and sign in to the Service, you are not anonymous to Mozy.

When registering with Mozy, you provide Personal Data, which may include company name, industry, number of employees, phone number, your title, city, state, country, zip code, a user name, confirmed email address, and a password. When backing data up with the Service, you send us that data and you also are sending file system information, including names of files and directories. Mozy may also record your IP address when you submit information.

Mozy also may collect, at your option, certain preference and demographic information from you.

All information collected by Mozy is used for internal purposes of providing the Service, providing support to users, and to improve services. Aggregating non-identifying information supplied by users allows Mozy to understand its user base and to improve services.

To protect your account information, please keep your password secure.

All Users may opt to remove their Personal Data from our live database by contacting Mozy and canceling their Mozy user account. Users of the Mozy.com Services may also cancel their user account by logging into their account, selecting My Profile, and clicking on Delete Account.

Mozy does not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13.

**Cookies and Passive Data Collection**

Mozy automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request.

Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering the Mozy websites might place Personal Data within a User's URL during a visit to their website, and Mozy has no control over such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by Mozy.

**Links to Third-Party Sites**

Mozy websites may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

## Disclosures

**Mozy Service Providers**

Mozy does not disclose Personal Data to third parties, except to process credit card information for orders. However, at a future time, Mozy may need to provide users' Personal Data to other third parties to deliver specific services to the user (such as hosting services or support services). These third parties will be required to adhere to Safe Harbor Privacy Principles or at a minimum Mozy will require the third party to certify they follow privacy protection equal to Mozy's. Users will also be provided with a mechanism to opt-out of having their Personal Data viewed by such third parties.

**Legal Requirements**

Mozy does not disclose Personal Data, including the data you back up with the Service, unless disclosure is necessary to comply with an enforceable government request such as a warrant.

**Change of Ownership**

In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition with another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of Mozy User information, including Personal Data, to a separate entity. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (by posting on our website or an email to the email address you provide when you register) of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of Mozy's assets by a third party, and you may choose to modify any of your registration information at that time.

## Security

Mozy uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by Mozy in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, Mozy cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "crackers" from obtaining this information.

## **Updating or Removing User Information**

You may, at any time, choose to correct or update the information you have submitted to Mozy by updating your account on our website.

If you cancel your account, your Personal Data and other information may be retained in our archive or backup records.

## Privacy Complaints

If you have a dispute or complaint about privacy on a Mozy website, we kindly ask that you attempt first to resolve the issue directly with Mozy by emailing [privacy@mozy.com](mailto:%70%72%69%76%61%63%79%40%6d%6f%7a%79%2e%63%6f%6d "privacy@mozy.com").

## Adherence to European Union Safe Harbor Privacy Principles

Mozy complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as published by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Mozy has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Mozy’s certification, please visit [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/ "http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/")

Among other requirements, adherence also involves engaging an independent third party to resolve privacy disputes. If you are a European consumer and feel your privacy dispute or complaint has not been adequately resolved, the [Council of Better Business Bureaus](http://www.bbb.org/us/european-dispute-resolution/ "http://www.bbb.org/us/european-dispute-resolution/") has been contracted by Mozy to handle complaints that allege a failure to comply with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.
