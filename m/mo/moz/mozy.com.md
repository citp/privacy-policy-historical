# Privacy Policy

### BERKELEY DATA SYSTEMS PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy explains Berkeley Data Systems Inc.'s policy regarding the collection and protection of Personal Data supplied by users or collected by us from users of the Mozy.com web site and Mozy backup service (the "Service").

Berkeley Data Systems defines "Personal Data" as any data from which it is practical to directly determine the identity of an individual. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in the Berkeley Data Systems License and Service Agreement[LINK] (the "User Agreement"). This Privacy Policy may be updated by Berkeley Data Systems from time to time. Berkeley Data Systems will provide notice of materially significant changes to the Privacy Policy by posting notice on the Mozy.com website.

By registering to use the Berkeley Data Systems Service, you agree (1) to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and (2) that Berkeley Data Systems may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy or the User Agreement. Personal Data may be processed by Berkeley Data Systems in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent. 

**HOW BERKELEY DATA SYSTEMS USES INFORMATION**

**Personal Data**

We **will not** sell or market the email addresses of registered Users to third parties.

We **will not** view the files that you backup using the Mozy backup service.

We **may** view your file system information (file names, sizes, types, etc.) to provide personalized content and services.

We **may** use your Personal Data to provide personalized content and services.

You acknowledge and agree that Berkeley Data Systems may provide you with advertising and promotional material and other information from Berkeley Data Systems and on behalf of third parties via email. If you do not want to receive such material, you must terminate your account and cease use of the Software and Service. We may also send you administrative communications regarding your account or the Service.

We may use Personal Data and other data you explicitly agree to send to us to determine which advertising and promotional material to provide to you. We may provide aggregated demographic and preference information to advertisers and other third parties.

**Cookies and Passive Data Collection**

Berkeley Data Systems uses cookie, IP address, and URL information to improve and further develop the Service, and to provide enhanced features to Users, where available. Berkeley Data Systems uses cookies to save User screen names, session validators, and on Users' browsers and hard drives, and may use them to provide tailored products and services to those Users, as they become available. 

IP Addresses also help us to diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Service, and to otherwise provide the Service to our Users. 

**USER INFORMATION BERKELEY DATA SYSTEMS COLLECTS**

**Personal Data**

Once you register with Berkeley Data Systems and sign in to the Service, you are not anonymous to Berkeley Data Systems. 

When registering on Berkeley Data Systems, you provide Personal Data, which includes a user name, confirmed email address, a password, and zip code. When backing data up with the Mozy Backup service, you send us that data and you also are sending file system information, including names of files and directories. Berkeley Data Systems may also record your IP address when you submit information. 

Berkeley Data Systems also may collect, at your option, certain preference and demographic information from you.

To protect your account information, please keep your password secure. 

All Users may opt to remove their Personal Data from our live database by contacting Berkeley Data Systems and canceling their Berkeley Data Systems user account.

Berkeley Data Systems does not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13.

**Cookies and Passive Data Collection**

Berkeley Data Systems automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request.

Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering the Mozy.com website might place Personal Data within a User's URL during a visit to their website, and Berkeley Data Systems has no control over such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by Berkeley Data Systems.

**Links to Third Party Sites**

The Mozy.com web site may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These web sites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the web sites. We have no responsibility for linked web sites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

**DISCLOSURES**

**Berkeley Data Systems Service Providers**

Berkeley Data Systems may need to provide your Personal Data to third parties to deliver specific services to you (such as hosting services or support services). These third parties are required not to disclose your Personal Data and not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Berkeley Data Systems.

**Law Enforcement; Subpoenas**

Berkeley Data Systems may disclose Personal Data, including the data you back up with the Service, with or without notice (a) if required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, (b) where required by law, or (c) at our sole discretion, where we deem it necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the general public or to prevent violation of our User Agreement or the rights of Berkeley Data Systems or any third party.

**Berkeley Data Systems Affiliates**

Although Berkeley Data Systems currently does not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "affiliates"), it may in the future. Berkeley Data Systems may share some or all of your Personal Data with these affiliates, in which case it will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. 

**Change of Ownership**

In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition with another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of Berkeley Data Systems' User information, including Personal Data, to a separate entity. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (by posting on our website or an email to the email address you provide when you register) of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of Berkeley Data Systems' assets by a third party, and you may choose to modify any of their registration information at that time. 

**SECURITY**

Berkeley Data Systems uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by Berkeley Data Systems in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, Berkeley Data Systems cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "crackers" from obtaining this information.

**UPDATING OR REMOVING USER INFORMATION**

You may, at any time, choose to correct or update the information you have submitted to Berkeley Data Systems, by updating your account on our website.

If you cancel your account, your Personal Data and other information may be retained in our archive or backup records.

**REVISIONS TO THIS POLICY**

Berkeley Data Systems reserves the right in our sole discretion to revise, amend, or modify this policy and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. Notice of any revision, amendment, or modification of this policy will be posted on the Mozy.com website, and a User's continued use of the Service will signify agreement to such changes.
