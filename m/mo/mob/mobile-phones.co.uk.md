### **Security**

Our website is a "Let’s Encrypt Secure Site" and keeping information about you secure is very important to us, however, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.  As a result, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.  Sensitive information, for example your security information and credit card details, is encrypted to minimise the risk of interception during transit.

  
We have security procedures in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control.  We have security measures in place to protect its user database and access to this database is restricted.  All information collected, or processed via the website is encrypted making it secure, inaccessible, and unrecognisable to any third parties.

We have put procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breaches and will notify you and the supervisory authority of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

### **Cookies**
