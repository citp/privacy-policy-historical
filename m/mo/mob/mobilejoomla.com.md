# Privacy Policy

Last Updated on Friday, 11 September 2015 12:53 

On our website ("Website" or "Service" or "Mobile Joomla!") you will be asked to provide an email address when registering for an account.

When you register you can choose whether to allow other forum members to contact you by email or private messaging and the type of personal information that is available using your user profile. You can also opt to subscribe to specific forums or threads which means your email address will be used to send information when new posts are made. All email from the forum site includes a link that allows you to opt out from continued subscription to that thread or forum. Forum administrators may use your email address to contact you if necessary.

Occasionally, we may use your email address to inform you about major new updates to Mobile Joomla!. You may always opt-out from this communication. See more below in section Email Marketing.

Your IP address may be used to identify duplicate user accounts (which are forbidden under the forum rules).

Should you choose to edit or create wiki pages your identity is recorded and your username is viewable by those who look at the history of the pages you have worked on. Your IP address may be used to identify possible abuse and may be blocked if abuse is detected.

On Mobile Joomla!, we may use aggregate IP information to help us understand the geographic distribution of those downloading and using Mobile Joomla! and other packages; in order to improve our product and service quality.

On any of the sites with commenting features your name, email address, and IP address will be recorded when you make a comment. This information will not be published or shared with any third parties.

A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use this Website (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Website, store your preferences and record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when you return to our site, such as indicating which threads you have read).

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.

However, some or all features of this Website may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 

## Sharing of information with third parties

With the exception of the issues discussed in this paragraph we do not share your information with third parties. On some sites, we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Also, we reserve the right to include a small advertising unit(s) on the mobile sites generated with the Mobile Joomla! extension. In this case, third parties, e.g. Google and other similar ad networks, may be placing and reading cookies on your browser, or using web beacons to collect information as a result of ad serving on the mobile site generated with Mobile Joomla! extension. Your own privacy policy must include this information in regard to your mobile site users. You may also disable the ad unit in your Mobile Joomla! installation with the ad removal module available through the Mobile Joomla! website.

Mobile Joomla! may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and for behavioral advertising and to personalize the advertising content you see after you have left this site. 

This Website may use the following services: Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics collects data about your traffic via Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. 

You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising, and opt out of the use of other Google services by visiting Ads Settings ([http://www.google.com/ads/preferences](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/)). Also see <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. How Google uses data when you use their partners' sites or apps:  <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners>. 

With Website's permit Google may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to transmit information, optimization, and displaying ads based on you using the Website.
