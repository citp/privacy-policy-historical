## Security and Privacy

mobileStorms’ web site uses security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We store the information in two redundant databases in two secure environments at different locations with our data hosting service provider, Savvis Communications.

mobileStorm takes care to reinforce the importance of our web site visitors’ security and privacy among our employees. mobileStorm requires unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a user logs on to mobileStorm’s client interface. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of all data. The bottom line is that, because our business involves hosting application accounts, data security is paramount. We’re constantly reevaluating and deploying new technologies to enhance our security.

In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets. In such transactions, visitor information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that all or substantially all of mobileStorm’s assets are acquired in a transaction, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred. Such a transaction will be disclosed per the “Notification of Privacy Policy Changes” guidelines above. Also, as with the data we collect on behalf of our clients, we reserve the right to disclose any data we collect at our Web site if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority or to protect the health and safety of mobileStorm’s employees or the general public.

mobileStorm is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which we link. We encourage our visitors to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
