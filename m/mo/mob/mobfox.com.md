# Privacy Policy | MobFox

  | **Updated on December 17th 2018**

Mobfox US LLC and its subsidiaries (“Mobfox”, “we”, “Us” or “Our”) put great efforts in making sure that we secure your personally identifiable information and use properly.

Mobfox is an international digital marketing company providing advertisers, agencies, publishers and application developers (“Customers”) with a wide range of digital and programmatic advertising solutions (“Service”).

This policy explains our privacy practices for processing personally identifiable information on Mobfox’s advertising solutions and platforms (the “Service”) and Mobfox’s Website (the “Site”). We process your personally identifiable information subject to the terms of this policy.  
  
Mobfox provides data driven technology to Mobfox Customers. | The Service

Mobfox provides Customers custom digital and programmatic based advertising solutions supported by large data analytics, proprietary platforms and optimization technologies. As such, Mobfox has no direct interaction with the individuals that visit Customers’ websites (“Users”).

The personally identifiable information Mobfox collects is typically used for Real-Time Bidding complex technological tools or platforms that enable advertising buyers to bid in “real time” for the opportunity to show an online advertisement when a web page is loaded, or an app is used by the User.

Customers required, according to Mobfox’ agreements with Customers, to provide an appropriate notice to Users about this Privacy Policy.  
  
We collect information you provide to our Customers and information about your device. | The Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect

Mobfox collects personally identifiable information in several ways (as described below) to provide the Service and for other specific purposes, as described in this policy. Please note that you are not required by law to provide us personally identifiable information. Data collected through Customers’ websites and ads When Users engage with Customers’ website or Customers’ ads, we will obtain the following types of personally identifiable information through our engagement with Customers:

  1. Data that User provides to the Customers, including registration details, age, gender and geo-location;
  2. Data about User’s device, including device dimensions, model, manufacturer, operating system and the origin of the data (the application or website that User used);
  3. IP address and connection type;



We obtain such information by using digital identifiers. You can find more information on our digital identifiers below:

  * Beacons, Pixels and Tags: Beacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, on websites by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page.
  * A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.
  * Mobile SDK: A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a beacon or tag (see Beacons and Tags above). The SDK is a piece of computer code that publishers include in their apps to enable ads to be shown and to enable related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, including by collecting and analyzing data which is available through the device on which the mobile SDK is installed.
  * Cookie: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.
  * Non-Cookie Technology: Today’s online world is becoming increasingly complex, with a proliferation of new devices, software platforms, online services and other technology. As such, cookies are not always available. Therefore, companies are using alternative methods to distinguish devices. For example, some platforms, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising. Most mobile devices are assigned unique identifiers that also may be used to distinguish devices. Additionally, it is possible to use mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses about recognizing devices.

  
We automatically log ‘traffic/session’ information including IP addresses and user agent.

We collect session durations and additional activity information If you register with the Service we will need your name, your company name, email address and password, for registration and notice purposes.

We will receive any personally identifiable information that you provide when commenting on our blog or site and when contacting us.

The Site will also include links to third-party social media websites such as Facebook®, Twitter®, LinkedIn® and Google+®, as well as associated social media features and scripts, such as the Facebook® “like” button and widgets.

These features and scripts will collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Site, and will set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by the applicable third party social media website or hosted directly on the Site.

Your interactions with these social media features and widgets, as well as your interactions with the social media websites themselves, are governed by the privacy policies of the applicable social media websites.

If you submit personally identifiable information in a comment on a blog post or on any applicable social media website, you should be aware that the personally identifiable information that you submit can be read, collected or used by others and could be used to send you unsolicited messages or otherwise contact you without your consent or desire.

We will use Customer’s email address to contact Customer when necessary, to send reminders and to provide information and notices about the Service. We will include commercial and marketing information.

If necessary, we will use personally identifiable information to enforce our terms, policies and legal agreements, to comply with court orders and warrants, and assist law enforcement agencies, to collect debts, prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity thefts and any other misuse of the Service, and to take any action in any legal dispute and proceeding.

We commit to process personally identifiable information solely for the purposes described in this policy.  
  
We use service providers, for example, to process payments and send email messages. We will transfer information as needed if we change our corporate structure, and we will share the information with our affiliate entities. | Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Others

We will share your personally identifiable information with service providers and other third parties, if necessary to fulfill the purposes for collecting the information, provided that any such third party will commit to protect your privacy as required under the applicable law and this policy.
