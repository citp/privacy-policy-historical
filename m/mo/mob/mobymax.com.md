Privacy Policy

Last updated on February 21, 2018

Student privacy is just as important to us as it is to you.

Our security starts with the data you enter into our program. Only the most basic personal information (name and grade level) is  
entered into MobyMax.

We never share your information with third parties, with only one exception: with your explicit permission, we may allow educational  
researchers to access aggregate class information.

You can reach out to us. We’re here to answer any additional questions you might have. Please don’t hesitate to call us at  
1-888-793-8331 (between 8 am and 5 pm ET) Monday-Friday, or email us at support@mobymax.com anytime.

What we do

Comply with COPPA  
and FERPA.

Allow teachers to replace  
student first and last  
names with nicknames or  
aliases.

Allow parents/guardians  
to view a student’s  
progress, time spent, and  
lesson data.

Constantly monitor the  
security and integrity of  
data.

Allow student accounts to  
be soft-deleted or  
permanently deleted.

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which MobyMax collects, uses, maintains and discloses personally identifiable information in records ("Student Records") collected from users ("User") of the www.MobyMax.com website ("Site"). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and all the services offered by MobyMax on this Site. 

COPPA and FERPA

We are committed to working with our Users to comply with laws, rules, and  
regulations governing the use and protection of Student Records, including  
the Children Online Privacy Protection (COPPA) and the Family Educational  
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and their implementing regulations,  
applicable state laws, and statues governing Student Records we receive  
from Users. As such, MobyMax is committed to protecting the security,  
confidentiality, and integrity of Student Records that we receive from Users,  
as well as to protecting against unauthorized access or anticipated threats. 

Personal identification information

We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways,  
including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Site, subscribe to email alerts,  
and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make  
available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address,  
mailing address, and phone number. Teachers or administrators choose which  
identifying information to include as the students' first name, last name, username,  
password, and ID. We never collect sensitive information such as student  
addresses, social security numbers, or dates of birth. We permit teachers or

administrators to replace student first and last names with nicknames or aliases. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously.  
We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always  
refuse to supply personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities.  
Users can correct any erroneous personal information by emailing support@mobymax.com or calling (888)793-8331. 

Non-personal identification information

We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal  
identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users' means of  
connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information.

Web browser cookies

Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance Users' experience. A User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping  
purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert  
them when cookies are being sent, but this may result in some parts of the Site not functioning properly. 

How we use collected information

MobyMax may collect and use Users' personal information for improving the User’s  
experience or sending periodic emails. Students shall not receive email alerts containing  
any advertising or product information. We may use information in the aggregate to  
understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources provided on our  
Site and so that we may improve our Site. If the User decides to opt-in to our email  
alerts, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related  
product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe  
from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the  
bottom of each email. 

Property and control of student data

All student records and data continue to be the property of and under the control of the  
local educational agency. Students are able to access, print, and otherwise retain any  
student-generated content by accessing it through various channels in their student  
accounts. If teachers provide parents or guardians with login instructions, they are able  
to access basic student MobyMax data like progress, lessons completed, and time  
spent.

What we don't do

Collect sensitive student  
information such as  
address, social security  
number, or date of birth.

Sell or rent user  
information.

Display commercial  
advertising.

How we protect your information

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures to protect against unauthorized access,  
alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on  
our Site. 

Sharing your personal information

We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others. We will not allow unrelated third parties to use your  
personal information for any reason without your consent. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any  
personal identification information regarding visitors, and users with our business partners for the purposes outlined above. We may  
disclose and share personal information with (1) our group companies or any entity which acquires any part of our business, (2) with our  
service providers (including, for example, suppliers who develop or host our sites), (3) with single sign-on providers that you use to access  
our software, (4) roster services that you use to update your student and teacher rosters, and (5) if required or permitted by law with  
other third parties with your consent.

Procedure for unauthorized records disclosure

In the event of a breach or unauthorized disclosure of student records that would be subject to disclosure under applicable federal or  
state law has occurred, MobyMax will take prompt and appropriate steps to mitigate further breach or release of student records,  
provide notice to the affected User promptly and without reasonable delay, and work with the affected User to provide information and  
assistance necessary to comply with any notification to parents, legal guardians, or students, as is required by applicable law. 

Contract termination/completion

Following expiration or termination of the agreement under which the User purchased access to the MobyMax web-based products or  
services, and upon receipt of written request from the User, MobyMax will destroy or, if agreed, return to the User, the Student Records  
in its possession within a commercially reasonable period of time. At any point, teachers or administrators are able to soft-delete or  
permanently delete student accounts and data. For clarity, data generated by MobyMax or our products that is in aggregate, or that is  
anonymized (i.e., personally identifiable information has been removed) may be retained by MobyMax and used for product  
improvement purposes. 

Changes to this privacy policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. If we change the  
policy in a material manner, for example, if we seek to use personal information in a materially different way than we had previously, we  
will provide at least 30 days’ notice to you so that you have sufficient time to evaluate the change in practice. Of course, you can always  
opt out by deleting your account before the changes take effect.

Your acceptance of these terms

Unless you have entered into your own school or district contract with MobyMax, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy by  
using this site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will be deemed your acceptance  
of those changes.
