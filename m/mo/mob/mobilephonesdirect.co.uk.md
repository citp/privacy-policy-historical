# Mobile Phones Direct :: Vodafone, Orange, T-Mobile, 3 & O2 Mobile Phone Shop.

At Mobile Phones Direct we take your privacy very seriously. We only ask you for details we need to take your order and to improve your online shopping experience. We only use these details for our own records and never sell them to third parties.

 **What information do we collect?**

1) We collect your contact details. It is important that you provide us with all of the contact details we ask for. We need these, first of all to send you your shopping and we may need to contact you if there is a problem with your order.

2) If you are ordering a contract phone from us we need to take some extra details from you, such as your previous address details and personal details such as your place of work. Without these we cannot perform the necessary credit checks we need to perform when selling contract phones.

3) We take your credit card details. It is important you give us the correct details in order for us to take your payment.

 **Secure ordering**

When you use our checkout your credit card details are sent to us over a 128-bit encrypted connection for your security and peace of mind.

 **Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information about you which are stored on your own computer. The only piece of information we keep about you on your PC is your username. No personal information such as contact details or credit card numbers are stored in cookies. It is important for you to have cookies “switched on” on your browser for our basket software to function properly.

 **Log Files**

We analyse log files for market research purposes to see how popular our site is and which parts can be improved. The statistics software we use does not allow us to track the browsing habits of individual users.

 **Changes to this policy**

We do change this policy from time to time. When we do we will post the changes on this page.
