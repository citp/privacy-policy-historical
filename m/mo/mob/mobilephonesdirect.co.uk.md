Below are examples of the categories of data collected:

When you use our products or services or contact us, certain additional information, such as your mobile telephone subscription number, may be transmitted to us as a standard part of that communication. Please also see the section "Use of Cookies and Web Beacons" below.

·           **We may collect demographic information** For example, your age, gender, postal code and language preferences. We may also collect other information you provide, such as your consents, preferences and feedback, information relating to your devices and other such information you provide us with. Please note that certain non-identifiable information collected from you may become personally identifiable when you provide us with your personal data. We may also obtain, in accordance with applicable law, some personal data from list-rental companies and other such publicly available sources.

2.       **IP addresses**

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your Internet protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

3.       **Use of cookies and web beacons**

When you visit our site, information is placed on your computer to allow us to recognise your computer. This information is commonly in the form of a text file known as a "cookie". Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your computer's hard drive, rather than on the website. 

We use cookies:

·           that are strictly necessary to enable you to move around our site or to provide certain basic features. We use cookies to enhance the functionality of our site by storing your preferences, for example. We also use cookies to help us to improve the performance of our site to provide you with a better user experience;

·           for website traffic analysis and anonymous demographic profiling so that we may improve our services; and

·           to enable us to identify your device, or you when you have logged into our site and to collect certain information about your computer, including your IP address, your computer's operating system, your browser type and the address of any referring websites. Our use of cookies is intended to provide benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password frequently during a session or the need to re-enter items you place in a shopping cart if you do not finish a transaction in a single visit. 

We may use so-called web beacons (or "pixel tags") in connection with our site. However, we do not use them to identify individual users personally. Web beacons are typically graphic images that are placed on a website and they are used to count visitors to a website and/or to access certain cookies. This information is used to improve our services. Web beacons do not typically collect any other information than the information your browser provides us with as a standard part of any Internet communication. If you turn off cookies, the web beacon will no longer be able to track your specific activity. The web beacon may, however, continue to collect information of visits from your IP-address, but such information will no longer be unique.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified before they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser so permits. Please understand that if cookies are turned off, you may not be able to view certain parts of this site that may enhance your visit. Some of our business partners whose content is linked to or from this site may also use cookies or web beacons. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

4.       **Storage of your personal data**

**Data Quality**

We take steps to keep the personal data we possess accurate and up-to-date and to delete out of date or otherwise incorrect or unnecessary personal data.

As certain products and services may allow you to manage your profile, we encourage you to access your personal data from time to time to ensure that it is correct and up-to-date. Please remember that it is your responsibility to provide us with correct details as well as to update the personal data you have provided us with in case of any changes.

**Security**

While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone, via the internet or otherwise, and no technology is completely safe or "tamper" or "hacker" proof, we take appropriate technical and organisational information security measures to prevent and minimise such risks.

Such measures include, where appropriate, the use of firewalls, secure server facilities, encryption, implementing proper access rights management systems and processes, careful selection of processors and other technically and commercially reasonable measures to provide appropriate protection for your personal data against unauthorised use or disclosure. 

Where appropriate, we may also take back-up copies and use other such means to prevent accidental damage or destruction to your personal data.

If a particular part of our site supports on-line transactions, all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using an industry standard security measure, such as the one available through "Secure Sockets Layer" ("SSL"), to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (" **EEA** "). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

5.       **Uses made of the information**

We use information held about you in the following ways (Please note that one or more purposes may apply simultaneously):

·           to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer: 

·           to fulfil your requests, process your order, for credit status approval and/or to verify your personal data in order to supply network airtime or services, or as may otherwise be necessary to perform or enforce the contract between you and us, to ensure the functionality and security of our products and services, to identify you and to prevent and investigate fraud and other misuses:

·           to personalise our offering and to provide you with information, products or services that we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes and to display customised content and advertising in our site. 

·           for marketing or research purposes, for example, to conduct market research and we may, in accordance with applicable law, contact you to inform you of new products, services or promotions we may offer. 

·           to develop our products and/or services. However, for the most part we only use aggregate and statistical information in the development of our products and services. 

·           To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.

We may share your personal data if we have your consent to do so.

We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by post or telephone. 

If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you. 

If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this. 

If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please tick the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data when you place your order.

Some of our products and services may be used to promote products and services of other companies. We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers or any other company, except to a member of our group (as indicated in the section on sharing your personal data below), for marketing purposes without your prior consent.  We may however provide aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
