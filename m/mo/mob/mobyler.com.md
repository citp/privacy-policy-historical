# MobileVoip | Mobile Voip app for iPhone, Android and Symbian

MobileVOIP ("MobileVOIP" or "we" or "us" or "our" or other similar pronouns) takes your privacy matters very seriously. Our Privacy Policy details how we receive and use information in connection with our website located at MobileVOIP.com (the "Site"), the MobileVOIP VoIP software ("MobileVOIP App") provided on the MobileVOIP.com website (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Services"). 

  1. **Collection and Use of Information**  
**MobileVOIP Application**  
When you install the MobileVOIP App and log in, you will be asked to allow us access to your mobile device's address book (collectively, "Personal Information"). 

Your phone number, which will be verified via a text message that will be sent to you or phone verification, will be used for identification purposes as your MobileVOIP user ID. 

MobileVOIP works with Crashlytics, Inc ("Crashlytics") to report any bug affecting our iOS and Android Apps. If either app crashes during normal use, the app will send certain information about the incident to Crashlytics. This information consists of the device type, OS version and certain hardware information about your mobile device, and the time of the crash, the state of the application at the time of the crash, and stack traces.
