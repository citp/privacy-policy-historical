We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998) and according to the Which? Web Trader Code of Practice.

We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service.

We will not e-mail you in the future unless you have given us your consent.

We will give you the chance to refuse any marketing e-mail from us now and in the future. We will never sell or pass on your details to a third party unless we believe an order has been placed fraudulently.

The type of information we will collect about you includes: 

  * your name 
  * address 
  * phone number 
  * e-mail address 
  * credit/debit card details 

We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent except for mandatory information required by the Network Providers in order to process a credit check for you.

The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by e-mailing us. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law and the Which? Web Trader Code.

If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first.

We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening. The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings.

If we believe an order has been placed fraudulently, or our online auction system has been abused, then we may share that information with third parties including the Police, credit card companies and any other organisation that may help to track and/or prevent future occurences of fraud or abuse.

If you have any questions or comments about privacy, please e-mail the business manager, [Lisa Green](mailto:lisa@mobiles.co.uk).
