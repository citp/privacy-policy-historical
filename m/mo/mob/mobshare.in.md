This Privacy Policy also applies in the offline environment in relation to personal data collected in connection with the promotion, sale, offering and/or provision of mobME products and services.

Please note, that certain mobME products and/or services may have a specific privacy policy of their own that will apply. This will usually be indicated in the terms and conditions or other material for the product or service concerned. Where that is the case the specific privacy policy for that product or service will prevail over this Privacy Policy to the extent of any conflict in content.

You may have provided us with certain personal details, such as contact details, in relation to your interest in purchasing or using our products and services without you having an existing customer relationship with mobME. You may provide us with such information, for example, by participating in one of our sales promotions or competitions or by requesting information about our products and services.

In order to be able to personalise our offerings to you and to create more attractive products and services, we may combine the information and personal data described above. We may also use the above information to create statistical information.

#### **4\. The Purposes for which we process your personal data**

mobME processes the personal data and other information described above only in connection with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**Provision of products and/or services**  
In order to provide you with the products and/or services you have requested, the processing of your personal data may be needed. In case we need to invoice you for those products and services, your personal data will be used also for that purpose. Also, to help us fulfill your request, we may share information with others, for instance, other parts of mobME, mobME's business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in the provision of a product or service. Personal data is also used to manage mobME's accounts and records.

**Development and improvement of products and services**  
mobME strives continuously to improve and develop its products and services, as well as to create new ones, the better to meet our customer's requirements. Sometimes it is necessary to use your personal data for that purpose.

**Communicating with you**  
We may use your personal data to communicate with you. We may, for example, wish to contact you in order to conduct market research, to inform you about our products and services or changes therein as well as to send you such information as we may be required to send. Certain mobME services provide you with the possibility to manage your preferences in terms of how you want us to communicate with you. Your personal data will also be processed in connection with your communication with us.

**Marketing of products and services**  
Your personal data may be used also to market our products and services to you as well as to do market research. Before we use it in that way, however, we will offer you the opportunity to provide your consent to our doing so. Also, some of our websites and other services we provide may be used for marketing products and services of companies with which mobME has agreed to such usage. However, mobME does not disclose your personal data to such companies or any other company for marketing purposes without your prior consent.

**Personalising our offering**  
We want to provide you with such an offering that would meet your personal demands. Therefore we may process your personal data in order to personalize our products and services to you. That may include, for example, customizing our websites and other services by obtaining and combining information relating to your use of other mobME's products and services.

**Statistical purposes**  
We may also use your personal data for statistical purposes.

#### **5\. Collecting the data of children**

Generally, mobME avoids collecting the personal data of children. However, our databases may nevertheless contain personal data of children due to the fact that it is not always possible to determine precisely the age of the user. Insofar as we ask you to provide your age, we block the service from any person who is under 13 years of age. From time to time, we will also make reasonable efforts to clear our databases of personal data relating to children.

mobME's policy is to request that minors (the age of minors is determined by local law where you reside) do not make purchases or engage in other legal acts on this site without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, unless otherwise permitted by applicable local law.

#### **6\. Ensuring data quality**

We aim to keep the personal data accurate and up-to-date and to delete out of date or otherwise incorrect personal data.

Insofar as you provide us with your personal data directly, we would like to remind you that it is your responsibility to provide us with correct and relevant information. As certain mobME products and services may allow you to manage your profile, we also encourage you from time to time to access your details to ensure that your personal data is correct and up-to-date.

To the extent permitted by applicable legislation, we may use public sources in order to verify that personal data we possess is correct.

#### **7\. Regular disclosures and transfer of personal data**

Generally, we do not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose your personal data to unauthorized third parties without your prior consent.

**mobME Affiliates, processors and other involved parties**  
We may transfer and/or disclose your personal data between mobME Affiliates in connection with processing personal data for purpose(s) for which it was collected, being a purpose outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Generally, mobME may make use of third parties to process personal data on its behalf. Personal data may also be transferred to mobME's business partners to the extent necessary for the provision of our products and services, such parties being, for example, mobME's professional advisers and mobME's retailers selling or providing our products and services. In all cases where a third party is granted access to personal data in order to provide processing services or as is necessary to provide mobME's products and services, the third party is bound by contractual agreement to process your personal data consistently with this Privacy Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your personal data.

In case a part of mobME's business is sold to a third party, the customer data registers relating to that business may be transferred to the entity that continues to operate the business.

_Financial and other such institutions_  
In relation to products and services requiring financial payment, your personal data may be provided to financial institutions and other third parties involved in such monetary transactions and in securing mobME's financial interests related to that transaction.

**Law enforcement and other governmental bodies**

Certain law enforcement agencies and other governmental bodies may have a legal right to obtain personal data from mobME. In such a case, mobME transfers personal data to the extent required by law.

_International transfers_

mobME is a global organization having Affiliates, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. This being the case, our products and/or services may be provided by using resources located in various countries around the world. Accordingly, your personal data may be transferred outside the country where you use the service or otherwise provide us with your personal data. That includes countries that do not have laws which provide specific protection for personal data where you may have fewer legal rights. However, mobME's privacy practices have been implemented so that all processing of your personal data is conducted in accordance with this Privacy Policy in every country where mobME does business.

#### **8\. How we protect your personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data**

While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via the internet or other technologies, and no system of technology is completely safe or "tamper"/"hacker" proof, mobME endeavours to use appropriate measures (having regard to the nature of the personal data involved) to prevent and minimise such risks in connection with your use of our products and services.

We endeavour to take appropriate measures, such as the use of firewalls, secure server facilities, encryption, implementing of proper access rights management systems and processes, careful selection of processors and other technically and commercially reasonable measures to provide appropriate protection for your personal data against unauthorised use or disclosure. We also make appropriate back-up copies and use other such means to prevent the accidental damage or destruction to your personal data and to ensure that our services are functioning properly.

mobME uses encryption technology when collecting certain financial personal data such as credit card information. If a particular part of a mobME website supports on-line transactions, we will use an industry standard security measure, such as the one available through "Secure Sockets Layer" (" **SSL** "), to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions.
