Because these third parties may retain or use your personal information, you should contact them directly concerning their privacy and information sharing practices.  For a list of these third parties to whom your information was disclosed, you may email us at info@Mobclix.com</p>
				<p><em>Other Mobclix, Inc. Businesses:</em> We are part of the Mobclix, Inc. family of businesses.  For a list of our family of businesses, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@Mobclix.com">info@Mobclix.com</a>.

In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.  When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms of use, conditions or other agreements or policies.</p>

If a change in ownership occurs that will result in your personal information being used in a manner different from that stated in the then-existing privacy policy, notification will be provided consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p>Please note that once your information is shared with a third party, our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling of any of your information (whether it be your personal information, your non-personal information, or your other information).  Any third parties to whom we may disclose any information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose any and all information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of any and all of your information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>
				<p><strong>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information.</strong> We may rent, sell, or share aggregated and/or demographic information (i.e., information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you), and other non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and the Mobclix, Inc. family of businesses to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including but not limited to advisors, advertisers, affiliates, business partners, and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our websites and the most popular features or services accessed.</p>

For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our websites, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party linked websites, even if our websites frame the linked third party website. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites.

It may take up to 30 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as product and service offers, requests for additional information, service updates or announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p>

				<p>We will implement your instructions within 30 days. We have policies and procedures in place and train our employees to honor your request. Please note that we may still need to call you for servicing or other non-marketing purposes.</p>
				<p>If you do not want us to send you postal mail for marketing purposes, you may remove your name from current and future mailing lists by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@Mobclix.com">info@Mobclix.com</a>; or sending postal mail to: Mobclix, Inc., Attn: 102 University Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301</p>

To opt-out of communications from our third party business partners, please contact them directly.</p>
				<h3>INFORMATION RETENTION, SECURITY, AND PROTECTION</h3>
				<p>Mobclix, Inc. and its family of businesses store your information, automated personal information, financial information, credit card, and billing information that we collect about you for a minimum of one year from the time of initial submission.  We may retain the information for indefinite periods of time during and for a minimum of one year after the term of your membership for billing purposes. Further, we may use this information for any purpose including but not limited to marketing, billing and/or any other purpose required by applicable law.</p> 
				<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, alteration, destruction, and disclosure. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. We use industry standard one-way SHA-256 hash to store all user information.</p>
				<p>Further, only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions; also, we restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a "need-to-know" that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services and websites, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</p>
				<p>We want you to feel confident using our websites to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
