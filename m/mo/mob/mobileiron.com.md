## Your controls and choices ****

You can exercise certain controls and choices about our collection, use and sharing of your personal data. Providing your personal data in the first place is optional but it may be necessary for certain MobileIron offerings, for example, to access whitepapers and other content, or to qualify your suitability as a vendor. In such cases, you may not be able to take advantage of requested offerings and some Site features, and some of our offerings may not be able to account for your interests and preferences.

**Your online access and control.** You can view, edit or delete your personal data online for some of the Sites and Services. You also can make choices about MobileIron's collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which Sites or Services you use. For example:

  * [Partner Portal](https://partnerportal.mobileiron.com/)
  * MobileIron University, via the MobileIron University tab in the [MobileIron Support Community](https://help.mobileiron.com/) or [Partner Portal](https://partnerportal.mobileiron.com/)
  * Resources for MobileIron personnel, some of which are available through the company [login](https://home.mobileiron.com/)

These choices do not apply to service notifications or other communications required for the purposes of carrying out your instructions, enabling you to make purchases you request and register for events or access to a Site or Service, administering your account, or as required by law, which you may receive occasionally unless you stop using or cancel the Site, Services and Products in accordance with their terms and conditions.

By using the Sites or Services or otherwise providing personal data to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use. For example, if we learn of a security system's breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on one or more Sites, sending an email or contacting you in another way.

**Browser-based controls**. Browser-based controls related to cookies and other tracking technologies are described below in the Cookies and other tracking technologies section.

**Community forums**. You can choose whether to publish content in MobileIron’s community forums, user-editable documents and/or commenting systems made available by the Site or Services. Any information you provide there (including any personal data) may be indexed by search engines and made available in response to search queries and may be published, read, collected and used by others. We are not responsible for personal data you choose to submit in these forums.

**Linked websites.** You can choose whether to visit websites or third-party applications or widgets operated by other companies that we do not own or control via links on the Sites or Services. The links may have been added by us or by a visitor, such as in a submitted comment. The links do not signify our endorsement of the other website, its contents, or the third party that offers the site or contents. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices.

**Your responsibilities**. You are responsible for the information you provide or make available to MobileIron, and you must ensure it is honest, truthful, accurate and not misleading in any way; does not contain material that is obscene, defamatory, or infringing on any rights of any third party; does not contain malicious code; and is not otherwise legally actionable. If you provide any personal data concerning any other person, such as individuals you provide as references, you are responsible for providing any notices and obtaining any consents necessary for MobileIron to collect and use personal data as described in this notice before you provide it to MobileIron.

## Cookies and other tracking technologies ****

Like many websites, the Sites use automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to the Sites.  Examples include your browser type and the address of the website from which you arrived at a Site.

They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, a number automatically assigned to your computer or device whenever you connect to the Internet. It is a unique address assigned by your Internet service provider or IT department on a TCP/IP network. Among other things, the IP address allows web servers to locate and identify your device. The automatic data collection tools also may collect information about your clickstream behavior. This includes, for example, the pages you view and the links you click. These tools help make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return. You can [block or delete cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html).

Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a [Do Not Track](https://allaboutdnt.com/) feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different from blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a Do Not Track feature enabled may still accept cookies. No industry standard currently exists on how companies should respond to Do Not Track signals, although one may develop in the future. The Sites do not currently recognize and respond to Do Not Track signals.

We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. You may opt out of this advertising if you are located [in the European Union](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) or if you are located [i](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/)[n all other parts of the world](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Generic, non-personalized ads will continue to be displayed.

Our Sites include social media features, such as social media widgets that link to a social media website or allow you to share website content. These features may collect your IP address and the URL of the page you are visiting on a Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features such as widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on a Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Storage and processing locations ****

Personal data collected by MobileIron may be stored and processed in your region or in any other country where MobileIron and our service providers maintain facilities, including any of MobileIron’s [offices](https://www.mobileiron.com/en/company/contact-us). As an integrated group of companies, MobileIron stores data primarily in the United States, where MobileIron and many of our service providers maintain processing operations. Wherever your personal data is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard it.

## Security and retention ****

The security of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 

We may scan messages automatically and check for spam, viruses, phishing and other malicious activity, illegal or prohibited content or violations of our agreements, this privacy notice or our other policies.

We will retain your personal data for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:

  * a specific retention period for a certain data type adopted and announced by us
  * the period for which the personal data is needed to provide our Services and Products and to operate our business (including maintaining and improving the performance of our Services and Products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records), as a general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods
  * the period until you actively delete the data if it is the type you provided with the expectation that we will retain it until you affirmatively remove it
  * a longer period if there is no automated control that enables you to access and delete the personal data at any time
  * a shorter period if the personal data is a sensitive type
  * a period required by a legal, contractual, accounting or similar obligation to retain the data (such as mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation or legal holds in anticipation of litigation)
  * a period dictated by the statute of limitations on legal actions related to the subject matter of the data
  * a period necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person



## EEA and Swiss residents

This version of the notice includes changes made to prepare for the GDPR, including the following paragraphs.

**Data Controller**. If you are resident in the EEA or Switzerland, MobileIron, Inc. is the data controller responsible for your personal data. If you are an applicant to or personnel of any other MobileIron group company, the data controller will be MobileIron, Inc. jointly with that company.

**Data subject rights**. Under certain circumstances, you have the [right](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/data-protection-overview-citizens_en.pdf) to request access to your personal data and to rectify it, to object to personal data processing, to request erasure of your personal data, to withdraw your consent and to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority.

**International transfers**. We use a variety of legal mechanisms to help ensure that your rights and protections follow personal data transferred from the EEA and Switzerland to countries that have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. These mechanisms include [standard contractual clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en) approved by the European Commission, your consent and, for transfers to MobileIron, Inc. or MobileIron International, Inc. in the United States, the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield in accordance with our [Privacy Shield Policy Statement](https://www.mobileiron.com/en/legal/mobileiron-privacy-shield-policy-statement).

**Data protection representative**. MobileIron International, Inc. is our data protection representative.

## Children ****

Our Sites and Services are not intended for use by children. We will promptly delete any personal data collected from someone under the applicable age of consent.

## Updates ****

We will update this notice occasionally and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our practice. We will post a prominent notice on this Site if we make material changes to the notice.

## Comments and questions ****

If you have a comment or question, please contact us by email at privacy@mobileiron.com or by post at 401 East Middlefield Road, Attn: Legal, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
