# MobiLoud - Privacy Policy

Through the MobiLoud service, we, Fifty Pixels Ltd (trading as "MobiLoud"), provide website operators and other individuals with a number of tools, services and assistance (including this website) to enable them to create, publish, and manage mobile applications.

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website, mobile applications and other products and services collectively as “Services.”

Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

We do not sell our users’ private personal information.

We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.

MobiLoud is a worldwide service. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, which may have rights and protections that are different from those in your home country.

Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by MobiLoud and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.

If you’d like to use third party services like plugins, SDKs, crash logging, advertising and analytics tools with our Services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself to those third parties. We don’t own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information. You should review their rules and policies when installing and using third party software.

If you are a user to one of our Users’ apps please note that this privacy policy doesn’t apply to you in regard to that specific app. We process limited information that users provide to our Users’ apps on behalf of our Users and in accordance with our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms). We encourage our Users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information.

The section above of our Privacy Policy is available under a Creative Commons Sharealike License and is based on Automattic's Policy.
