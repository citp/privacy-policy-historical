MobileMoneyCode.net respects the privacy of every individual who   visits our websites. This privacy statement provides notice of the   standards and terms under which MobileMoneyCode.net protects the   privacy of information supplied by visitors to sites on the World Wide   Web that are owned and operated by MobileMoneyCode.net, including   MobileMoneyCode.net and www.MobileMoneyCode.net. This privacy   statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of   the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change   from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this   information.<br>
<br>
<strong>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong><br>
MobileMoneyCode.net typically receives specific data about its   website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily,   such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for   services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume   information for  employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these   activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a   purchase, use a credit card to pay for services,  submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you   provide personally- identifiable information to MobileMoneyCode.net   through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific   request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select   whether you do, or do not, want MobileMoneyCode.net to use this   information for additional purposes. You may also request that   MobileMoneyCode.net not use your information by sending an e-mail   to admin@MobileMoneyCode.net , however, MobileMoneyCode.net   reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other   important information about your MobileMoneyCode.net services.   Absent any instructions from you, MobileMoneyCode.net may use   information you provide to inform you about additional services and   products offered by the MobileMoneyCode.net family of companies,   MobileMoneyCode.net authorized agents, and other goods and services   providers with whom MobileMoneyCode.net has relationships and   whose offerings might be of interest to you. MobileMoneyCode.net   will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable   information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in   the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those   MobileMoneyCode.net sites where you may provide   MobileMoneyCode.net with credit card or other ordering information   via the web, MobileMoneyCode.net protects and secures this   information by employing commercially customary web- based security and   encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer   (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you   voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments,   suggestions, ideas or the like, MobileMoneyCode.net will treat that   portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and,   except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement,   MobileMoneyCode.net assumes no obligation to protect such   information from disclosure.<br>
<br>
<strong>B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information:</strong><br>
In general, MobileMoneyCode.net gathers some generic information   automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the   visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address   assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the   MobileMoneyCode.net sites visited. MobileMoneyCode.net   gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer   service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain   technologies, including "cookies" (a technology that can be used to   provide the visitor with tailored information about   MobileMoneyCode.net services). MobileMoneyCode.net does not   combine information collected in this way with any   personally-identifiable information. You can set your browser to notify   you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.<br>
<br>
<strong>C. Your MobileMoneyCode.net hosted website, server, bulletin boards, forum, Third-Party Sites:</strong><br>
Information that you disclose in a public space, including on any   bulletin board, chat room, or website MobileMoneyCode.net may host   for you as part of your MobileMoneyCode.net services, is available   to anyone else who visits that space. MobileMoneyCode.net cannot   safeguard any information you disclose in these locations. Additionally,   MobileMoneyCode.net websites contain links to sites that belong to   third parties unrelated to MobileMoneyCode.net.   MobileMoneyCode.net cannot protect any information you may disclose   in these sites and recommends that you review the privacy policy   statements of those sites you visit.<br>
<br>
<strong>D. Exceptions and Limitations:</strong><br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing and in compliance with applicable laws,   MobileMoneyCode.net (i)  cooperates fully with state, local, and federal officials in any   investigation relating to any content  (including personal or private electronic communications transmitted to  MobileMoneyCode.net) or purported unlawful activities of any user   of the Service, and (ii) takes reasonable measures to protect its   proprietary rights. For the limited purposes of accomplishing such   cooperation and measures and in compliance with applicable laws,   MobileMoneyCode.net may be required to disclose personally   identifiable information. In addition, MobileMoneyCode.net may   elect to monitor the areas of communication of any kind (i) to satisfy   any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is   necessary or appropriate to operate MobileMoneyCode.net; or (iii)   to protect the rights or property of MobileMoneyCode.net or others.   In connection with the potential sale or transfer of any of its   interest in MobileMoneyCode.net and www.MobileMoneyCode.net   and other sites owned by the company, MobileMoneyCode.net reserves   the right to sell or transfer your information (including , but not   limited to name, address information, and other information you provided   to MobileMoneyCode.net) to a third party that (i) concentrates its   business in communication products or services; (ii) agrees to be   MobileMoneyCode.net 's successor in interest with regard to the   maintenance and protection of information collected and maintained by   MobileMoneyCode.net; and (iii) agrees to the obligations of this   policy statement.<br></td>
