#### (a) Information Collected or Received from You

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.

If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name and email address (“PII”).

If you create an Account through the Site or one of these third party accounts, we will also collect some information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. Additionally, we will need to collect your summoner name, gamer tag, or other game-account related identifier in order to associate our Account with you with your game’s account.

##### (ii) Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.

Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.

 **“Cookies”** are small text files that are placed on your device by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.

 **“Web Beacons”** (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).

 **“Log Data”** means information our servers automatically collect about how a person uses our Services, including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, hardware specifications, network specifications, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, amount of time spent using our Services, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics.

### 3\. Information that We Share with Third Parties
