<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><br><br>
<div id="content">
<div class="loop">
<div class="descender"><p>Mobiledia Corp. ("Mobiledia.com") understands your concern with privacy
and the use of your personal information. By browsing through our website,
we assure you that we are committed to protecting your personal privacy.</p></div> 
<p>1. Information Mobiledia.com Collects</p>
<p>Mobiledia.com collects e-mail addresses of consumers who communicate with
us or through our authorized vendors via e-mail. We also collect information
on web pages visited and other information that is provided by consumers
either on our site or in response to e-mail communications from us.</p>
<p>All information provided by consumers in any of the above-listed ways
or otherwise becomes the property of Mobiledia.com once received by us and
may be used and disclosed as permitted in this Policy.</p>
<p>Browsing on our Website</p>
<p>If you browse through our site without entering any personal data, we
will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information
does not identify you personally and cannot be linked back to you unless
you decide at some point to identify yourself.</p>
<p>If you are only browsing, we collect the following information: IP address,
the type of browser and operating system used to access our site, the date
and time you access our site, the pages you visit (click-through), and if
you linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of that Web
site, as well as additional information related to your visit.</p>
<p>2. How We Use Your Personal Information</p>
<p>Collected information is used to improve the content of our website,
customize the content or layout of our website for individual users, provide
services requested, notify users of updates to the site and, subject to
the limitations set forth below, to develop new products and services and
to contact consumers for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Special Sections of Our Site</p>
<p>Mobiledia.com offers forums on its site. Any information you disclose
in these forums is available to all Mobiledia.com registered members and
may increase the risk of receiving "spam" or unsolicited e-mail from other
parties. Be careful and use discretion when disclosing information online.</p>
<p>3. Cookies</p>
<p>Cookies cannot be used to retrieve data from your hard drive, obtain
your e-mail address or obtain sensitive information about you. When a cookie
is set, your browser will check it for length, an expiration date, and where
it originated. Only Mobiledia.com can access the cookies that we set.</p>
<p>Mobiledia.com allows our ad service company to set cookies as well. These
cookies can "recognize" a consumer by a Unique identifier assigned at the
time of the first visit, and may be used to measure site and page visits
and browser version number, and browsing activity. This information may
be used to better serve and provide advertising content on future visits
and web pages viewed during your browser sessions on our websites. These
cookies cannot obtain private information like name, e-mail or other personal
information, and are not shared with Mobiledia.com.</p>
<p>We use a third party tracking service who sets cookies on our site to
track visits, page views and click stream behavior. The third party tracking
service reports this data to us in aggregate so we can better understand
our users and to improve our site. This information is not tied to any individual
user.</p>
<p>4. Third Party Ad Servers</p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our
Web Site. If so, a list of these ad serving companies will be available
here. These companies may use information (generally, not including
your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits
to this Web Site and to other web sites in order to provide advertisements
about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies
and clear GIFs to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information
that these third parties collect via cookies and clear GIFs is generally not
personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personally
identifiable information to them through an ad or e-mail message).
We encourage you to read these businesses' privacy policies if you should
have any concerns about how they will care for your personal information.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your
choices about not having this information used by these companies,
see the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer web site at
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">
http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
<p>If we are going to use your personally identifying information in a manner
different from that stated in our privacy policy at the time of collection,
we will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not
to allow us to use your information in this different manner. In addition,
if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect
user information already stored in our database, we will revise this policy
and update the date displayed at the top of this policy to reflect that
the policy has been changed. In some cases we will also e-mail users who
have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes
in our privacy practices.</p>
<p>In the event Mobiledia.com or its assets are acquired, such as through
merger, acquisition or similar event, resulting in a change in ultimate
control over customers' personal information (other than through an internal
corporate reorganization or similar transaction), customers will be notified
promptly of such change. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that
the acquirer of our customers' personal information respects the provisions
of this privacy policy, although this may not be possible in certain legal
settings (such as bankruptcy).</p>
