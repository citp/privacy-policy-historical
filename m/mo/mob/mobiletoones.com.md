## Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

Mobile Toones allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Mobile Toones Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the YouTube Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. 

Mobile Toones does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. The advertiser may use information regarding your use of the YouTube Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Mobile Toones's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. 

Currently, Mobile Toones has relationships with the following third-party ad servers or ad networks:
