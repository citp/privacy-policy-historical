We do not ask for any information from you when you visit our site. If you sign up for our newsletter, we will ask for you email address and name so that we may send that newsletter to you via email. We may also ask what country and US city you live in. This information is for our own demographics only (so we know what languages to offer the site in, and from what time zones you're most likely to visit us). This demographic information is completely optional. If you register to use our discussion forums, we will ask you for your email address and your password will be mailed to you as part of our user verification process. **** When registering to use our discussion board, you have the option to enter other information about yourself. This is entirely optional, and these items are of general interest to your fellow board members. We will also ask you for your birthdate in compliance with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ([COPPA](http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/9910/childfinal.htm)) is intended to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. As of April 21, 2000, many Web sites are required to obtain parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13. **  
We will never sell your name or any other information about you to a 3rd party.**
