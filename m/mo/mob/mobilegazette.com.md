If you click on an advertising link this will be shown in our statistics. No personal information is passed to us from the advertisers or merchants. We do not hold any information that can be classed as personal data under United Kingdom law.

We welcome pre-launch tips and product details and will receive and republish these with no reference whatsoever to our sources.

We do not publish personal information or pass addresses from our mailing lists on to others. A general exception to this rule is where we receive fraudulent emails requesting mobile phones to be shipped to them, especially from Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina, South Korea, China or the former Soviet Union. In these cases we will publish your personal details and report you to the relevant authorities.
