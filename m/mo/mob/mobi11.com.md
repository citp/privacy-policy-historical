Your comments are always welcome but please do not use excessive paragraphs when commenting and make it look longer. A short and sweet comment holds more value than a long one like this:

Thanks!

(Know what we mean? We hope you do

**Owner’s Words:**

Here is an honest truth from the owner and blogger of Chaos Inc.:

“I respect your privacy and I personally feel that one user shall know their online rights. I also feel that statistics matter because it will help develop the entire online and e-commerce market. I never engage with ad networks that entices people to do something and uses the info in an illegal way. Hence I recommend you to always know your rights and liabilities before you surf on the net or

simply try someone’s service out. Personally I feel that most of the bigger ad networks like Google, Yahoo, DoubleClick, MSN, TribalFusion, Admob etc will not hamper or tamper any info wrongly without thinking about the users or publishers and they will deliver the readers, publishers and visitors with all the good stuff while respecting their rights. Hence I never engaged myself with advertisers outside a very few. ”

But, still you should check out their policies in case you want to know more about privacy.
