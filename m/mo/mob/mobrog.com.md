###  3\. Data Security

Information collected by MOBROG is stored in accordance with our site security policy and we take reasonable steps to ensure that Member information is secure from unauthorized access, interference and loss, modification or disclosure. If MOBROG no longer requires a specific information, we will take reasonable steps to destroy such information. 

###  4\. Access & Correction

Information collected by MOBROG can be accessed and updated by the Member by using the facility provided on the Site (you will be required to log in first). Furthermore you can contact MOBROG Support anytime and ask for any stored information concerning you. You can easily request deletion of your information by opting-out as described below. 

###  5\. Linked Sites

The MOBROG Site, the survey invitations we send you, and if applicable, the email promotions we send you may provide links to our partner and advertiser web sites. If you link to any of these Third Party sites this policy will not apply to your use of those sites. 

###  6\. Frequency of email communications

All email communications that result from your MOBROG membership will be sent directly from us and will prominently feature the MOBROG logo and our contact details. Except PayPal, none of our partner companies will contact you. After completing a given survey, you may experience a gap of some number of days before another survey invitation is offered. While every attempt is made to send each Member survey invitations frequently, due to various factors, a given Member may not receive as many invitations to participate in surveys as they would like. Note that MOBROG is under no obligation to offer any specific or minimum number of survey invitations whatsoever. 

###  7\. Opting out

As a condition of membership, you must provide a valid email address and agree to accept survey invitations from us.

If you do not wish to receive survey invitations from us, you must terminate your membership using the facility provided in the profile. A link to an opt-out facility is also provided at the bottom of every survey invitation we send you (you will be required to log in first). By following this link you may terminate your membership.

In the event that you opt-out it may take up to 72 hours for your opt-out request to take effect. You will not receive any further email promotions from us after that time.

Your account will become inactive for and permanently deleted after seven days except from such data that has to be archived for legal reasons. After that, all personally identifiable information will be destroyed. This also affects any outstanding or undelivered rewards due. If you want to reverse your membership termination within these seven days, please contact our support.

###  8\. Changes to this policy

MOBROG reserves the right to update this policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).  If you do not agree with this privacy policy in completely or in part, or if you do not agree with changes made to this policy, you must not become a member or terminate your account.
