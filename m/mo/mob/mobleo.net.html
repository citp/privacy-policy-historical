                        protecting your privacy. This statement provides our privacy policy for 
                        Mobleo and explains our online information gathering practices 
                        and the choices you can make regarding your personal information. 
                        Although our privacy policy may change, our commitment to protect your

                        Mobleo collects information online primarily to make it easier and 
                        more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on the service 
                        you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide 
                        information such as your name, e-mail address, or other contact 
                        information. On other occasions such as when you want to purchase 
                        products or advertising online, we may request your credit card number to 
                        conclude the transaction while allowing you to control your privacy. 
                        <ul><br>
                        <li><b>IP Address</b><br>
    	                  An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically 
                        assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When users 
                        request a page from our site, our servers log the current IP address. We 
                        use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to 
                        administer our website. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally
                        identifiable. This means that while a user session will be tracked, the 
                        user will be anonymous. <p>
    	                  </p></li><li><b>Cookies</b><br>
    	                  "Cookies" are pieces of data your browser stores on your computer's 
                        hard drive that contain information about your website preferences and 
                        website activity. We do not use cookies to retrieve personal information 
                        about you from your computer. Most web browsers automatically accept 
                        cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent the acceptance
                        of cookies. If you elect to reject cookies you can still use our services 
                        on our website, but you may be limited in view and functionality. Our 
                        policy does not cover the use of cookies by any other companies we choose 
                        to have on our site. <p>
                        </p></li><li><b>Your Account</b><br>
    	                  When you become a member or associate of Mobleo, we will ask you for your 
                        name, address, telephone number, and email address. If necessary, we use 
                        your contact information for help in processing an order or request you have 
                        placed. We may ask for demographic information and interest-based information when
                        you create an account. However, whether you provide such information is 
                        purely optional. <p>
                        If requested, we may from time to time, use this information to send you alerts about 
                        new products, services, or other promotions. We may also ask you to 
                        participate in a survey. You can at any time "opt-out" of receiving such
                        communications by sending us an e-mail to the following e-mail address: 
                        <script type="text/javascript">de("<a class='general_small' href='mailto:mobleo@nowhere.com'>mobleo@nowhere.com</a>");</script><a class="general_small" href="mailto:mobleo@tbsystems.com">mobleo@tbsystems.com</a>. </p><p>
                        </p></li><li><b>Other Information We Collect</b><br>
    	                  When you purchase our products or services, we ask you for information
                        such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card 
                        number. We store and use this information so we can process your order. If 
                        necessary, we might use this information to contact you for help in processing
                        the order. <p>
                        Whenever you send us comments or feedback in e-mail or letter or if other 
                        users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or 
                        posting's on the website, we may collect and store such information. </p></li></ul><br>

    	                  <li><b>Personal Information</b><br>
    	                  Personal information includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, 
                        method of payment information, or other data that identifies you as an 
                        individual. Your personal information is used by Mobleo in order to 
                        provide you with free trial services or to process your purchase of our 
                        products and services. Mobleo does not sell, trade, rent, or release 
                        your personal information to third parties unless given permission to do so. When
                        permission has been given, and you now choose to keep your information private, you can 
                        "opt-out" at any time. <p>
                        </p></li><li><b>Aggregate Information</b><br>
    	                  Mobleo may occasionally share aggregate data about our users, traffic 
                        patterns, sales, and other website information with partners, vendors, and
                        reputable third parties. This data, however, does not contain any personally 
    	                  identifying information. For example, we don't disclose that you purchased 
                        a specific product or service, but we may share statistics on how many customers 
                        have purchased a specific product. <p>
                        </p></li><li><b>Legal Issues</b><br>
    	                  Mobleo discloses personal information when required by law or in the

                        We incorporate industry standard practices to safeguard the 
                        confidentiality of any information you choose to share with us. 
    	                  After your information reaches Mobleo, it is stored on a 
                        secure server, which means it resides behind a firewall and is 
                        not readily accessible from outside the company. At that point, your 
                        information is only readily accessible by our employees. 
                        All such employees sign a confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement, 
                        which provides legal confidentiality protections for our users. <br>&nbsp;<br>

                        For their protection, children are not eligible to use our services. 
                        Because we are not a children's website, we do not provide most of the 
                        privacy measures that are so important for their protection on the 
                        Internet. Thus, we ask that minors do not submit any information to us
