&nbsp;<br xmlns=""><br>Most recent update <b xmlns="">November 28, 2011.</b><br xmlns=""><br>Exxon Mobil Corporation and its affiliated companies, ("ExxonMobil") appreciate your interest in this Web site and other related or linked ExxonMobil sites (Site). Your privacy is important and we want you to understand our practices with respect to gathering information from visitors to the Site and with respect to the uses we make of that information. Please check each portion or page of the Site that you visit. Certain portions or pages of the Site may contain changes to the Privacy Statement applicable to your use of that portion or page, for example, certain applications may request additional information from you.<br xmlns=""><br><b xmlns="">Information and Uses</b><br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">
When someone visits the Site, our web servers automatically gather information that allows the site to communicate with the visitor's computer during the visit. We also track such information as the number of visits to the site, which parts of the site visitors select, IP address (the Internet address assigned to your computer from your Internet Service Provider), domain type, browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome&nbsp;or Internet Explorer), date and time of day. We use such information only for statistical purposes that help us design and administer the Site.&nbsp;<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">
Privacy concerns focus on Personal Information, that is, information that could identify a specific individual such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. If during your visit you personalize the Site, complete an order form, enter a contest, or submit other information to us, you may provide us with Personal Information. We may collect and use that Personal Information to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and services you request, to tell you about ExxonMobil&nbsp;products and services which we think may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes.<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">
As a visitor of our Site, you may be asked that we read the geolocation of your computer or mobile device; this geolocation information will be used to provide the services you request such as showing the location of nearby service stations, and the route to service stations; we may also use this geolocation information to tell you about ExxonMobil products and services, for instance in combination with weather information about the geolocation of your computer or mobile device. If you do not wish us to use the geolocation information for such purposes, you can decline our request to read the geolocation; in that case, some of the services of our Site may not be delivered. We may provide the geolocation information to third parties who assist us in the provision of the services and communications to you through the Site.<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">As explained below in the section on Dissemination of Information to Third Parties, we do not distribute or sell Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to market their products and services to you; moreover, as explained in the Opt Out/Modify Information section, we will make a reasonable effort to remove your Personal Information from our database in such a way that you will not receive future communications from us, if that is your wish.&nbsp;If you notify us that Personal Information previously submitted to our site is no longer accurate, we will make a reasonable effort to make appropriate corrections. &nbsp;To facilitate our efforts to meet your request,&nbsp;it would be helpful if you could let us know the context in which you provided Personal Information, e.g in connection with promotion of a specific product or service.<br xmlns=""><br xmlns=""><b xmlns="">Information Placed on Your Computer</b><br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">
We may store some information (commonly known as a "cookie") on your computer when you look at or use the Site.

(The ‘help’ screen in your browser or computer user manual should tell you how to do this.)<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">We use third-party advertising technology to provide ads when you visit sites upon which we advertise. This technology will not process any information that can be used to personally identify you, that is it will not include your name, address, or other personal information. When you access an ad, a "cookie" file will be stored on your computer. This information is used to help manage our on-line advertising.
