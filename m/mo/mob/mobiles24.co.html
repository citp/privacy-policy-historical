		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	</div>
<div>
	  	  <p>Mobiles24. ("Mobiles24" or "we" or "us" or "our") is a mobile content discovery platform. We enable our community of users to actively download, produce, promote and share original content such as wallpapers, themes, ringtones, apps, and games.</p>
	  	  <p>We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting the information we collect. The following privacy policy is designed to let visitors to and users of www.mobiles24.co (our "Website") and mobile applications (our "Mobile Apps") understand our privacy practices. We refer to our Website visitors and Mobile App users as users ("Users") of the Mobiles24 service (our "Services"). We also encourage you to read through our terms of service http://www.mobiles24.co/tos of which are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by reference.</p>
	  	  <p><strong>1. WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES MOBILES24 COLLECT?</strong></p>
	  	  <p><strong>a) User Provided Information.</strong> We obtain certain information when you provide it to us: for example, if you setup your account profile, you may provide your name, email address, your date of birth and a list of interests such as your favorite music and television shows. Some of that information can be used to identify or contact you directly and is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information.<br>
	  	    <strong>b) Information from Use of our Service.</strong> Mobiles24 gathers non-personally identifiable information from Users of our Service. Non-personally identifiable information is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include: the Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, operating system, mobile network information, browser type, locations of the Website pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website, and non-precise location information (e.g., your city or zip code). Mobiles24 enables you to send messages to other Users in the Mobiles24 community. While we generally don't read the content of these messages, we keep track of the number of messages sent and similar information to keep our Service running smoothly. Mobiles24 also enables you to 'friend' other members of the Mobiles24 community, and records which members of the community you've friended, which Mobiles24 groups you've joined, and what pieces of content you've uploaded via the Service.<br>
	  	    <strong>c) User Generated Content.</strong> We offer our Users the opportunity to post reviews, upload images and audio, and offer opinions. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service . In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information on publicly viewable web pages or applications, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. We encourage you to read the Mobiles24 online safety tips.<br>
          <strong>d) Facebook Connect</strong> - When you connect or login to Mobiles24 with your Facebook account, we can access certain information you've added on Facebook in order to provide a social and personalized experience while using the Service. We adhere to the Facebook Platform Policies which restrict how we may can access and use this information. If you log into our services via Facebook Connect, we collect the following information from your Facebook account, including: your name, city, your birthday, your Facebook Connect ID, and the list of your Facebook friends.</p>
	  	  <p><strong>2. HOW DOES MOBILES24 USE INFORMATION?</strong></p>
	  	  <p><strong>a) User Provided Information.</strong> We use the personally identifiable information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Services to: deliver the products and services that you have requested, manage your account and provide you with customer support, communicate with you about products or services that may be of interest to you, and to monitor compliance with the rules governing the Service. For example, we may review messages sent via the Service between you and other members of the Mobiles24 community for compliance with our policies, but will treat these messages as private to the extent required by applicable law. We don't sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.<br>
	  	    <strong>b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information from the use of our Service.</strong> Mobiles24 analyzes non-personally-identifying information gathered from users of the Website and the Mobiles24 App to help Mobiles24 better understand how our Service is being used and to help tailor content and advertising on the Service. By recognizing patterns and trends in usage, Mobiles24 is able to better design our Service to improve Users' experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.<br>
	  	    <strong><a name="cookies"></a>c) Friend information</strong> - Mobiles24 enables you to 'friend' other members of the Mobiles24 community. Your "friends" can see certain information about you, including: links to your Twitter and Facebook accounts (if you have connected those accounts to your Mobiles24 account), a list of your friends, and the content you've uploaded into the Mobiles24 Service. We offer you the ability to control the types of information that is available to friends, and to the public via the Service. As part of connecting you to your friends, we may search your phone's contacts for other friends using Mobiles24 who you may want to connect with. However, we do not store the information from your phone's contact list on our servers.<br>
	  	    <strong>d) Cookies &amp; User Preferences.</strong> A cookie is a text file that stores information on behalf of websites and certain mobile applications.
