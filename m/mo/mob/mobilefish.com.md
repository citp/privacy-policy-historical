Contact Forms.  
Mobilefish.com contact forms require users to give contact information (like their name and email). The contact information from these forms is ONLY used to get in touch with the users when necessary. I do not rent, sell, share or in any way give your personal information to anyone. I will not use your email address to send you unwanted advertisements.

External Links.  
This site contains links to other sites. Mobilefish.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

Privacy Philosophy.  
I hate spam, junk mail, and unwanted advertisements just as much as you. What I am saying is that I know what it's like and consider spam a horrible way to promote a website and would therefore never do it myself or help any other site to do it. In fact I recommend you to join project [Honey Pot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org/?rf=43013) to identify spammers and the spambots they use to scrape addresses from websites.
