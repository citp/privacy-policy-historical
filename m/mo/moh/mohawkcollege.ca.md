The names of alumni, their School and program, award information, degrees, diplomas and certificates awarded and date of graduation is considered public information and may be published by Mohawk College. In addition, student photographs posted by the College in the form of individual pictures or class pictures may be publicly displayed. Aside from the foregoing, the information you provide and any other information placed in a student record, or in a personnel record, will be protected and used in compliance with Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (RSO 1990) and will be disclosed only in accordance with this Act.
