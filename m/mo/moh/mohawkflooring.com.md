# Privacy Policy

| 

This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for this web site operated by Mohawk Industries, Inc. (“Mohawk”). Mohawk wants you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding Mohawk’s collection and use of your personally identifiable information through this web site. 

### Information Collection and Use

Mohawk collects personally identifiable information when you visit the site’s pages or when you voluntarily provide information to Mohawk through the site. 

The site automatically logs information about you from your browser when you visit the site, such as your IP address, the pages you visit and similar information. You may also choose to voluntarily provide us with information about you at various places on the site. Personal information which we may ask you to provide includes your name, location, e-mail address, company affiliation, telephone number, and other similar information. 

This site may place and access cookies when you visit the site. A cookie is a small data file that web sites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file contains information that can identify you each time you visit the site. This site uses cookies as a way to measure activity and traffic patterns on the site. You may choose to set your computer to reject cookies if you desire. 

From time-to-time our site may request additional information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose additional information that may be requested. Information requested via surveys and contests may include additional demographic information. 

Mohawk may use the information collected through this site to send you information and promotional material, to process your requests for information or services, or to customize the site for your future visits. 

### Sharing and Disclosure

Mohawk is not in the business of selling or renting your personally identifiable information. Mohawk may share information about you with others under the following circumstances: 

  * when necessary to third parties who work for Mohawk in order to process your requests or provide you information;
  * when you consent to disclosure; 
  * by operation of law, when such information is transferred as a part of a sale of assets including the assets represented by this site; 
  * to comply with law, court orders, subpoena or legal process; or 
  * to enforce or apply Mohawk’s agreements or protect Mohawk’s rights. 



In the event that Mohawk or substantially all of its assets are acquired outside of the ordinary course of business, your information may be one of the transferred assets. 

### Linked Sites

It is important to note that Mohawk’s web site contains links to other web sites and that those other web sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Mohawk. For instance, if you click an ad on our web site, this may take you away from our site to an entirely different web site. This includes links from advertisers, content providers and trade partners who may use our logo and/or style as part of a co-branding agreement. These other web sites may collect data from you that Mohawk would not and may use that data in ways that Mohawk would not. 

### Security

This site takes precautions to protect your personally identifiable information. In certain areas of the site, your information may be protected using standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take steps to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information is restricted in our offices. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added; our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. 

### Correcting and Deleting Information

1\. If the information you have given Mohawk changes and you would like to modify it or if you would like to view the information Mohawk has about you, send your request to the following location. In addition, if you wish to remove information about yourself from Mohawk’s files, use the Contact Mohawk form or send an email to the address listed on the site. 

With any request, provide Mohawk with a means to identify you and contact you if necessary. Mohawk will respond to appropriate requests within a reasonable time. 

### Changes to Privacy Policy

Mohawk may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If Mohawk decides to change its privacy practices for this site, Mohawk will post those changes to the Privacy Policy on the site in advance of the changes taking effect. You should periodically check the site to review changes.
