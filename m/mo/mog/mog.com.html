<h2 class="generic">Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Effective August 26, 2005</p>

<div class="textpage">
	<dl>
		<dt>About MOG</dt>
		<dd><p>MOG is a service and system that allows our members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends.  MOG members can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and meet new friends, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests.  To enrich our members' experience, we request and display personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends.  MOG members create their profiles, and have the ability to change their profile information at any time.  They also have the ability to control how other
members and the service communicate with them.</p><p>MOG cares deeply about online privacy.  If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at "privacy at mog dot com".</p></dd>
	</dl>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Information Collection and Use by MOG</dt>
		<dd><p>MOG collects information submitted by its users, such as name, email address, and age, to authenticate users and to send them notifications 
relating to the MOG service.  MOG also collects other profile data,
including but not limited to, personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation, in order to assist users to find and communicate with each other.</p>

<p>MOG also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site.  This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services, among other things. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide services and advertisements to members.  User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>

<p>When you download and install MOG-O-MATIC, it may automatically assign to you a MOG unique identifier ("MUID") that is associated with your application. The MUID will never be matched with any personally identifiable information about you and it is not shared with any third parties or partners. The MUID allows us to analyze unique player usage patterns on an anonymous, aggregated basis, among other things.</p>

<p>MOG uses technology that provides you with the ability to show others your musical collection and your musical listening habits.  MOG-O-MATIC retrieves this contextual information and stores a Title Unique Identifier ("TUID") on your computer.  The TUID allows MOG-O-MATIC to retrieve this information efficiently.   Data regarding the specific content you are playing is retained until you have removed your MOG account.  You have the option to turn this feature off by right clicking on the MOG icon in your system tray on a PC or via System Preferences on your Mac.  MOG-O-MATIC data is collected to serve targeted advertising to you.</p>

<p>User Profile information including members' pictures and chosen screen names are displayed to users and visitors in order to facilitate interaction in the MOG community.  Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join MOG, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the service.  With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network.  Users within a personal network communicate on MOG with each other through the MOG service, without disclosing their email addresses – unless they so chose.   Users' full names are never directly revealed by MOG to other members or visitors.  To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, MOG allows users to search for other members using first and last name, and email address.  We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service.</p>

<p>From time to time, MOG or a partner, may sponsor a promotion,
sweepstake or contest on MOG.  In order to participate, users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions.   We may transfer personal
information to ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from.  It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.</p>

<p>Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members MOG members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system.  MOG stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the referring member’s friend's list, and also to send reminders of the invitations.  MOG does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders.  Recipients of invitations from MOG may contact MOG to request the removal of their information from our database.</p>

<p>MOG members may also store email addresses of people they know in
their internal MOG address book and may also choose to send
invitations and other communications to those addresses.</p></dd>
