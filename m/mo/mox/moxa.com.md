The processing of your personal data is governed by applicable privacy laws.

## 2.What roles do we play in processing your data?展開/收合

We are the data controller with respect to processing your data (contact details below). This means that we decide how your personal data is processed and for what purposes. We know that you care how data about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.

  * whenever you are filmed by our surveillance cameras located in or near our premises. These images are recorded solely for the purpose of protecting property and people’s safety, and for preventing abuse, fraud or other criminal activities from which our customers and ourselves could also become victims.



## 4.Our collection of personal data展開/收合

The personal data we collect include any and all data you provide to us when you enter into contract with us, register an account with us, enter on our website, provide us information on a web form, update or add information to your account, or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide data to us, but we may then not be able to service you where such services require processing such data. We use the data that you provide for purposes administering your use of our services, such as communicating with you, responding to your requests, managing your account, customizing your service experience with us, improving our products and services, and personalizing marketing measures and activities. We may communicate with you by mail, email or telephone. We will send you strictly service-related announcements or information on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. 

Examples of the data we collect and store include: your e-mail address, name, address, phone number, login, account name, account number, password, your account activity, files accessed or used by you, transaction data and any information you provide during a transaction, or other transaction-based content that you generate or connected to your account as a result of your transaction, financial data such as bank accounts and credit card numbers, logistics and billing data (such as customs ID and tracking number), your chat and service history with us, and any other information you may provide us such as your age, gender, interests, and preferences. 

We also receive and store certain types of data whenever you interact with us. For example, we use "cookies," which are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to provide features of our services such as personalized advertisements on other websites, provide remote access for you, allow you to visit our website without re-entering your username and/or password, verify that you have the authorization needed for the services to process your requests, personalize and improve your experience, record your preferences, customize functionalities for your devices, and to improve the functionality and user-friendliness of our services. It also helps us to better understand how you interact with our services and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our website. Most of the cookies used by us are so-called "session cookies". Cookies do not cause any damage on your computer and do not contain any viruses. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify your browser setting by editing your browser options to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. However, if a browser does not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, some portions of our services may not function properly. 

We obtain certain types of data when your web browser accesses our website or advertisements and other content served by us or on our behalf on other websites, such as the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, device ID or token, unique identifier, device type, ID for advertising, referral URL, computer and connection data such as the type of operating system you use, your device information, your software information, browser type, browser language and version, ad data, access times, your browsing history, and your web log information. Our website automatically receives and records your IP address that your browser sent us on our server when you log in to our website. We will store your IP address in our user registration databases. We will use your IP address for the following purposes:

  * send the most appropriate banners based on geographic area or information derived from your IP address.
  * estimate the total number of visitors from specific countries or regions all over the world.
  * help to identify customers.



We may also receive data about your location and your mobile device when you download our apps. This includes a unique identifier for your device. We may use this data to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. You can turn off location services on your device. 

Our website keeps your account information active in our user registration databases in order to provide immediate access to your personal data each time you visit our website, as noted above. 

All the data we collect from you may be stored as log files in our server or as augmented information associated with you or your devices. These log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other purposes. Your data is stored in log files until the data is transferred to backup databases. We routinely back up a copy of your data to prevent loss of your data in case of a server breakdown or human error. However, all such copies of your data in our backup database will be retained only for as long as our data retention policy permits (see “How long do we keep your personal data?” below), and will in any case be deleted immediately upon your request.

  * third parties involved in a legal proceeding, if they provide us with a court order or substantially similar legal procedure requiring us to do so.



We may provide you with opportunities to connect with third-party applications or services. If you choose to use any such third-party applications or services, we may facilitate sharing of your information with your consent. However, we do not control the applications or services of those third parties or how they use your information, and your use of such applications and services is not governed by this Statement. Please review the terms and the privacy policies of those third parties before using their applications or services. 

Most of the advertisements and marketing communications that are sent to your web browser are made by us. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to provide advertisements on our website. These companies may also send cookies to your computer. If an advertiser asks our website to show advertisements to certain visitors and you respond to that ad, the network advertiser or ad-server may think you as of the targeted audience they are trying to reach. The personal information you disclose to other parties such as network advertisers, third-party ad servers, or other websites from the Internet are protected by their respective privacy policies. The privacy policies of different network advertisers or third-party ad servers are not bound to this policy, and our website is not responsible for these privacy policies. 

We will display your personal data and account activity in your profile page and elsewhere on our service portals according to the preferences you set in your account. You can review and revise your profile information at any time. Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity.

Please consider what files your share and devices you publish. 

## 11.How long do we keep your personal data?展開/收合

We keep your personal data for no longer than reasonably necessary for the given purpose for which your data is processed.

Notwithstanding the above, we may retain your personal data as required by applicable laws and regulations, as necessary to assist with any government and judicial investigations, to initiate or defend legal claims or for the purpose of civil, criminal or administrative proceedings. If none of the above grounds for us to keep your data apply, we will delete and dispose of your data in a secure manner according to our data protection policy. 

## 12.Privacy of data subjects under the age of 16展開/收合

Our products and services are not targeted to persons under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from persons under the age of 16. 

## 13.Your rights and your personal data展開/收合

Unless subject to an exemption under applicable privacy laws, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data: 

  * The right to request a copy of your personal data which we hold about you.
  * The right to request that we correct any personal data if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date.
  * The right to request to erase your personal data where it is no longer necessary for us to retain such data, except we are not obliged to do so if we need to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
  * The right to withdraw your consent to the processing at any time if we rely on your consent to process your data. This includes cases where you wish to opt out from marketing communications that you receive from us.
  * The right to request that we provide you with your data and where possible, to transmit that data directly to another data controller, where the processing is based on your consent or is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, and in either case we process the data by automated means.
  * The right to restrict our processing of your personal data where you believe such data to be inaccurate, our processing is unlawful; or that we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose unless we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it.
  * The right to object to us using your personal data, where the legal justification for our processing of your personal data is our legitimate interest. We will abide by your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or if we need to continue to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. 
  * The right to lodge a complaint regarding our processing of your data, with the competent authority where you reside or in which your data is processed. 



If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please do so by providing your request to the contact window set forth in the “Contact Us” section. 

After receiving your request, we will evaluate your request and inform you how we intend to proceed on your request. Under certain circumstances in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations, we may withhold access to your data, or decline to modify, erase, port, or restrict the processing of your data. 

Please be advised that if you exercise the rights to erase data, restrict or object to our processing, or to withdraw your consent, we may not be able to continue our services to you if the necessary data is missing for processing. 

## 14.Transfer, Storage, and Processing of Data Abroad展開/收合

As noted in the “Sharing your personal data” section of this Statement, as a globally operating company, we may share your information with our affiliate companies or third parties. Please refer to the “Sharing your personal data” section of this Statement for the recipients of your data and the reasons for our provision of your data to them. Where such entities are located in other countries and jurisdictions, we will therefore be transferring your personal data outside of the European Economic Area. In making such data transfers, we make sure to protect your personal data by applying the level of security required by the applicable privacy laws. Where we transfer your data to a country or jurisdiction that cannot guarantee the required level of protection as required by applicable privacy laws, we have enhanced our IT security measures and have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with the transferee to require security obligations on the transferee, both of which are intended to increase the protection of your personal data. Standard Contractual Clauses are one of a number of "appropriate safeguards" under the applicable privacy laws that enable the transfer of personal data concerning data subjects within the European Economic Area to jurisdictions that have not been designated by the European Commission as possessing an adequate level of data protection. You may request a copy of such Standard Contractual Clauses from us, or inquire about transfers of your information, by providing your request to the responsible committee set forth in the “Contact Us” section. 

## 15.Profiling展開/收合

We strive to provide the most relevant and valuable marketing experience for you. Therefore, we collect the basic information you provide to us when you opt into our communications (such as email address, company name, industry, country, etc.) in order to supply you with content that is applicable to your business and job role. We will also couple that with any inferred data you provide through actions you take when interacting with the content we offer you. For example, if you are interested in specific industry topics, we may offer you more information about such topics the next time we have news to share.

We are mindful of the impact that personalizing your marketing experience can create. Therefore, we apply the following safeguards: 

  * We have carried out, and will carry out on an annual basis, a Data Protection Impact Assessment to consider and address the impact to you before we conduct any new profiling.
  * We collect only the minimum amount of data we need for our profiling purposes.
  * To the extent possible, our priority is to use anonymized or pseudonymized data, instead of data that can directly or indirectly identify you, in our profiling activities.
  * All such data are secured with the technical measures described in the “Security” section of this Statement.
  * We carry out regular checks to ensure that our systems are working as intended.



If you do not agree with our carrying out profiling using your data, please note that you have the right to object to such use of your data, and you can object via submitting your request to the responsible committee set forth in the “Contact Us” section. 

## 16.Further processing展開/收合

If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose not covered by this Statement, then we will provide you with a new notice explaining this new use prior to commencing such further processing for a new purpose, setting out the relevant new purpose and processing conditions. In such case, we will find a lawful basis for further processing, and whenever necessary we will seek your prior written consent to such further processing. 

## 17.Security展開/收合

We protect your data using technical measures to minimize the risks of misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss or theft, and loss of access. Some of the safeguards we use are data pseudonymization, data encryption, firewalls, and data access authorization controls. We take our data security very seriously. Therefore, the security mechanisms used to protect your data are checked and updated regularly to provide effective protection against abuse. 

The website through which we collect your information are usually encoded, using the encryption module of your browser, and are certified for international encryption technique. If necessary, we use SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encryption to protect your personal information. Moreover, we have put in place additional and comprehensive state-of-the-art security measures when your data is accessed via the Internet. Firewalls prevent unauthorized access. Diverse encryption and identification layers protect your data from intrusion or disclosure to third parties during data transfer. Furthermore, we internally use sophisticated encoding methods in order to prevent decoding by unauthorized persons. Moreover, an electronic identifier is generated during data transfer to safeguard your information. 

For your confidentiality and security, we use a user ID and a password to secure your personal information. It is important for you to protect your ID, password, or any personal information. Do not disclose your personal information (especially password) to anyone. When you are finished using our services, please do not forget to log out from your account. If you share a computer, whether in a public or private setting, be sure to sign off and close your browsers when finished using a shared computer. 

Despite our best efforts, however, security cannot be absolutely guaranteed against all threats. If you believe that the security of your data has been compromised, or if you like more information on the measures we use to protect your data, please contact us following the instructions in the “Contact Us” section below.

## 18.What are your choices?展開/收合

You have the choice to allow us to collect and process your data. The collection and processing of your personal data is neither a statutory nor a contractual requirement, although as noted above, we will be unable to provide you with certain services without the data necessary for such services purposes. 

If you are dealing with us online, note that most browsers will inform you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies. Additionally, you can disable or delete data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, on your browser or on the website of its manufacturer.

You can always choose not to provide your data to us, although we may need such data to process your requests, in which case we will inform you of our constraints.

To the extent that you have consented to our processing of your data, you can choose to discontinue our processing at any time.

You can choose to request from us a copy of the personal data we store and process regarding you.

You can choose to add or update data that you have provided to us.

You can choose to erase your data, or you may choose to restrict our processing of your data instead.

You can choose to port your data to a third party under conditions stated above.

You can choose to object to our processing of your data.

You can choose to not allow us to engage in building a personalized marketing profile based on such profile.

Your choice or request on any aspects of data processing listed above can be communicated to us using the channels set forth in the “Contact Us” section of this Statement.

In summary, what we are allowed to do with your data is, with limited exceptions under applicable privacy laws, up to you. However, in the event that you choose for us not to further process your data, such choice may affect the delivery of our obligations or services to you; in this situation, we will inform you of our constraints.
