                            <p>Moxtra does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

Moxtra encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online experience safer:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Teach children never to give Personal Information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.</li>
                                <li>Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.</li>
                                <li>Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Please visit the FTC’s website for more tips on protecting children’s privacy online.</p>
