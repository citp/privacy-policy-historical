# Privacy Policy - The Official Web site Of The Missouri Lottery

MISSOURI LOTTERY PRIVACY POLICY

Your privacy is important to us. State laws and good business practices prevent us from redistributing any information that you may send to us via e-mail, by entering a Web-based (on-line) promotion form or subscribing to receive any of our print or e-publications unless the Lottery receives a valid [Sunshine Law](http://www.ago.state.mo.us/sunintro.htm) request.

 **BROWSING**  
While you browse the LOTTERY'S Web site our operating system will automatically record the following information: 

  * The name of the domain from which you accessed our Web site. For example, if you are connecting from an America Online account, the fact that someone who visited this Web site uses AOL as an Internet service provider will be known, but the individual e-mail address of the user will not be known.
  * The date and time any page on our site was accessed.
  * The address (also referred to as the URL) of the Web site from which any page on this site was linked. For example, if you clicked on a hyperlink on the Web site for Yahoo.com to reach the Lottery's Web site, that fact is recorded. However, as discussed above, your identity remains unknown.
  * The type of browser being used, such as "Netscape Version X.X" or "Internet Explorer Version X.X."
  * The type of operating system you use such as Macintosh, Unix or Windows. 



This tracking system does NOT record information about individuals. This information is used to monitor traffic and improve this site.

 **INFORMATION WE COLLECT**  
In order to complete your on-line transactions and entries, we may collect information from you, including your name, postal address, phone number, birth date, e-mail address or other pieces of information deemed necessary.

Our on-line forms should always indicate the information that is required and the information that is optional--you do not have to complete any "optional" fields on a form. For us to be able to accept your on-line transactions, however, you must supply the required information.

 **SAFEGUARDING OF COLLECTED INFORMATION**  
The Missouri Lottery takes reasonable measures to safeguard the information you transmit to it through its on-line applications and forms. These measures include the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for transactions that include legally confidential or personal information. Such technology allows the Lottery to encrypt the information you transmit over the Internet using security software. The purpose of this software is to scramble the information and render your personal or confidential information unreadable to anyone who would try to intercept it. The information collected by the Lottery in order to complete your on-line transactions or entry is not shared with third parties unless it is a valid [Sunshine Law](http://www.ago.state.mo.us/sunintro.htm) request. In that case, you will be notified. Secure transactions will have an advisory statement regarding the security measures in place for those particular transactions. You always have the option of deeming the security measures to be unacceptable to you and terminating the on-line transaction or entry.

 **E-MAIL ADDRESSES**  
In the course of normal business, the Lottery may request and obtain your e-mail address. These addresses are not redistributed to third parties unless it is a valid [Sunshine Law](http://www.ago.state.mo.us/sunintro.htm) request, and are used only to respond to your inquiry or request. E-mail addresses may be gathered and aggregated in order to determine certain demographical information, such as what services or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) our customers are using. Such information will be used in the aggregate only with no isolation or identification of any particular individuals.

 **LINKS TO OTHER SITES**  
The Lottery's Web site provides links to other Web sites. The privacy policies described here do not apply to any external sites. You must determine from such external Web site what its privacy policy is.

 **OTHER INCIDENTAL INFORMATION**  
In the course of normal business, the Lottery may obtain and analyze certain other pieces of customer information. Examples of these types of information might include your network (IP) address, your browser type, the pages and files retrieved from servers, and so forth. This information is used only in the aggregate for statistical analysis and problem determination. Particular individuals are not identified through this analysis. 

The Lottery's Web site is hosted on servers administered and controlled by the State of Missouri's Office of Administration.

 **COOKIES**  
Definition of a "cookie": A message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores this information on your computer. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from that server.  
From time to time, the Lottery may employ cookies in order to facilitate your entry or transaction. You will be informed if cookies are required for a particular on-line transaction, and you will have the option of refusing the cookie and the on-line transaction. 

**MISSOURI SUNSHINE LAW**  
As a state governmental agency, the Missouri Lottery is subject to Chapter 610 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, commonly known as the [Sunshine Law](http://www.ago.state.mo.us/sunintro.htm). Many of our records are not subject to disclosure under the Sunshine Law (e.g., all tax records and in some instances, drivers and motor vehicle records). However, if an appropriate request is made to this department for information that is subject to disclosure under the Sunshine Law, the department may be required to disclose the information requested, even if it may include your personally identifiable information.
