This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how we handle the Personal Data provided to us as described in this Privacy Policy, including through websites, mobile sites, mobile applications, and other digital services and products controlled by Molecular Devices, LLC, 3860 N. First St., San Jose, CA 95134, USA, that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, “Molecular Devices Sites”). Molecular Devices is the data controller for the processing of Personal Data under applicable law.

This Privacy Notice does not apply to Molecular Devices Sites that do not link to this Privacy Policy or to third-party Web sites to which Molecular Devices Sites may link.

#### **TYPES OF INFORMATION  WE COLLECT ONLINE**

The types of Personal Data that we may collect while you use the Molecular Devices Sites are described in this section and include both information that you provide to us and information that we collect automatically when you use the Molecular Devices Sites.

You do not have to register for a service or program to receive much of the information available through Molecular Devices Sites. However, some of our content is available only to registered or identified users and will require you to set up a profile or provide specific information about yourself in order to provide you the service.

When you use the Molecular Devices Sites, we also may collect certain usage and device information automatically as described below.

**IP Address**  

We may record the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or other electronic device when you visit the Molecular Devices Sites. An IP address identifies the electronic device you use to access the Sites, which allows us to maintain communication with your computer as you move about Molecular Devices Sites and to customize content.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

We also collect information about your use of Molecular Devices Sites through tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons. A “cookie” is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A “Web beacon” is a transparent graphic image placed on a Web site, e-mail or advertisement that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. These technologies help remember your preferences and allow us to bring you the content and features that are likely to be of greatest interest to you on the basis of “clickstream” data that shows your previous activities on Molecular Devices Sites.

We utilize Google Display Advertising (such as Retargeting with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting) to (1) show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to Molecular Devices Sites, and (2) better understand our ad impressions and use of ad services. In connection with the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting service, we may use data from Google's interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics to understand and improve our marketing campaigns and Site content.

Some of our online advertising takes place through Google Display Advertising. As part of this program, we use Google Analytics features such as Retargeting. In connection with that feature and others offered by ad networks, we and the operators of ad networks, including Google, may use third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) – and in some cases first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) – to inform, optimize and serve ads across the Internet, based on a user's past visits to Molecular Devices Sites. We also may show you ads from some of our affiliated companies when you visit Molecular Devices Sites.

You can opt out of Google Ads by visiting <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences>. If you do not want your data used by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at the[ Google Analytics opt-out page](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Under data protection laws, Molecular Devices must have a legal basis to process your Personal Data. The legal basis that applies in an instance will depend on for which of the specific purposes described above Molecular Devices is processing your Personal Data:

  * In certain cases, Molecular Devices may ask for your consent to collect and process your Personal Data. Should you choose to provide your consent, you may later withdraw your consent by contacting us as described in the “Your Privacy Choices” section. Please note that the withdrawal of consent will not affect processing which has already occurred.
  * In other instances, the processing of your Personal Data may be necessary in order to comply with an applicable law or regulation or for the performance of a contract to which you are subject. You may not be able to opt-out of this processing, or your choice to opt-out may impact our ability to perform a contractual obligation otherwise owed to you.
  * In still other instances, Molecular Devices may process your Personal Data based on Molecular Devices’ legitimate interests in communicating with you about our products and services, and about scientific research and educational opportunities. You have the right to opt-out of all such processing of your Personal Data. You may do so by contacting us as described in the “Your Privacy Choices” section.

By using this site, you consent to storage and processing of your Personal Data in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations.
