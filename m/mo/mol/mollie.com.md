## 2\. Does Mollie process special and/or sensitive personal data?

Unlike the processing of payments, Mollie’s websites and services are not aimed at activities that require special and/or sensitive personal data to be processed. Mollie therefore requests that you do not provide this information. Furthermore, Mollie has no intentions at all of collecting information about website visitors who are minors, even if they have permission from their parents or guardians. Unfortunately, Mollie cannot check whether a visitor is a minor and therefore Mollie advises parents or guardians to be involved in their children’s online activities in order to prevent minors’ data from being processed by Mollie.

Should you, in spite of the above, be convinced that Mollie unlawfully processed special or sensitive data, Mollie requests you to contact us at [info@mollie.com](mailto:info@mollie.com) or +31 20 820 20 70. Mollie will then delete this information as soon as possible.

## 9\. Mollie’s responsibilities
