Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you (except as provided below). We may also use clear GIFs (a.k.a. “Web beacons”) in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

Additionally, when using the Site, we and any of our third party service providers may use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track your user activity on the Site and identify the organization or entity from which you are using the Site. If you register with the Site, we, and our third party service providers, will be able to associate all of your user activity with your personally identifiable registration information. We will use such user activity information to improve the Site, to provide context for our sales and support staff when interacting with you and customers, to initiate automated email marketing campaigns triggered by your activity on the Site and for other internal business analysis.

We may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, and we may use such aggregate information to administer the Site, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

## Disclosure

We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization, except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Acquia participates or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of Acquia’s assets to which this Site relates. We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to parent, subsidiary or affiliate entities within Acquia’s corporate family, partner entities that are not within Acquia’s corporate family and vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a credit card processing company to process your payment. Such third party service providers may be obligated to protect your personally identifiable information consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy and not for their promotional purposes and/or required to enter into written confidentiality and data processing agreements including the commitment to be compliant with the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission. We will also disclose your personally identifiable information (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Acquia Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our services.

These precautions take into account the risks involved in the processing, the nature of personally identifiable information, and best practices in the industry for security and data protection.

## Accountability for Onward Transfer

Acquia is accountable for personally identifiable information that we receive and subsequently transfer to third parties. If third parties that process personally identifiable information on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are accountable, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Contact information and Customer personally identifiable information is accessible only by those Acquia employees and consultants who have a reasonable need to access such information in order for us to fulfill contractual, legal and professional obligations. All of our employees and consultants have entered into confidentiality agreements, and/or have been subjected to thorough criminal background checks requiring that they maintain the confidentiality of Customer personally identifiable information.

In the event Acquia discloses personally identifiable information covered by this Policy to a non-agent third party, it will do so consistent with any notice provided to Data Subjects and any choice they have exercised regarding such disclosure. Acquia will only disclose personally identifiable information to third-party agents that have given us contractual assurances that they will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and the Principles and that they will process personally identifiable information for limited and specific purposes consistent with any consent provided by the individual. If Acquia has knowledge that a third party to which it has disclosed personally identifiable information covered by this Privacy Policy is processing such personally identifiable information in a way that is contrary to this Privacy Policy and/or the Principles, Acquia will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing. In such case, the third-party is liable for damages unless it is proven that Acquia is responsible for the event giving rise to the violation.

Acquia may use from time to time a limited number of third-party service providers, contractors, and other businesses to assist us in providing our solutions to our customers or in meeting internal business operation needs. These third-parties may access process or store personally identifiable information in the course of performing their duties to Acquia. Acquia maintains contracts with these providers restricting their access, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information in compliance with our obligations under the Principles.
