In order to be able to use the websites and games run by upjers, all users need to agree to the use of their data described below. This consent may be revoked at any time, effective immediately and indefinitely. In this case, neither websites nor games may be used.

The following includes an explanation of the most important terms, in order to facilitate an understanding of this data privacy statement.

## Glossary

_What is personal data?_  
Personal data is data allowing the user to be identified. This includes, for instance, the real name, email address, telephone number, address or credit card information of the user.

 _What is user data?_  
User data is data upjers collects from their users, processes and saves when the user visits or uses websites and games run by upjers. User data in particular includes attributes to identify the user (such as the domain name and/or the IP address of the computer the user uses to connect to upjers sites or services).

 _What are IP addresses?_  
IP addresses serve to identify machines that are connected to the internet. Each computer that is connected to the internet can be allocated a certain IP address, that is, a specific combination of numbers.

 _What is a cookie?_  
A cookie is a small text file that transmitted by the websites and games of upjers - as well as by many other websites - to the cookie file of the user's browser. The cookie is saved on the user's hard drive by the user's browser, allowing the websites and games to recognize the user on his or her next visit. A cookie contains, among other data, the domain name the cookie is from, the "operating time" of this cookie and a value, generally a specific number that has been created randomly. Cookies cannot be used to identify the user. Users can use all upjers web pages and games without cookies, if the browser is set to automatically decline them. Cookies already saved on the computer can be manually removed by the user. upjers informs its users that it may not be possible to fully utilize its games and websites without using cookies.

## § 1 Collecting, Processing and Saving Personal Data

upjers collects, processes and saves personal data that the user has willingly passed on in electronic or other forms of communication (such as in forms or otherwise on upjers websites and games). This includes data that the user confides to other users, such as by communicating with them via upjers games and sites. Certain information such as communication between users is also visible to other users of upjers websites and games.

In order to register to use upjers games, users must submit certain personal information. This includes, for instance, email addresses. If users want to make use of additional offers inside the games, upjers may need further information, such as their bank account and/or credit card details.

Here a few examples of the data that upjers saves:

If a user registers on a game run by upjers, upjers automatically saves the domain name and/or the IP address of the computer the user uses to contact upjers.

upjers saves the email address of the user, if the user has transmitted this to upjers.

## § 2 Use of Personal Data

upjers collects, processes and saves users' personal data only inasmuch as upjers thinks this is necessary for reasonable legal business purposes. upjers collects, processes and saves this user data, in order to allow the users a better use and understanding of their websites and games and to be able to offer them better service. That means that upjers, for instance, won't just be able to use the saved data to directly carry out the user contract including all its possible forms of use (such as using the games, participating in services connected to games, use of customer support), but also to detect malfunctions or misuse of upjers ' websites and games.

upjers may use the email addresses submitted by users to send newsletters and information about this game. Users may of course always withdraw their consent in writing (for instance via email), without incurring any costs, apart from those of sending in the revocation. The user can decline to receive further info-messages and newsletters sent by upjers by sending a revocation.

upjers may pass on user data to service providers charged with collecting payments, inasmuch as this is necessary to calculate the payment and to charge the user. upjers furthermore may offer user data to third-parties if upjers has commissioned them to recover debts, inasmuch as such data is necessary to claim those debts. upjers will inform the user about the name of these third-parties upon request. In case upjers cooperates with third-parties to offer their services, upjers will ensure that they adhere to the applicable data security laws and offer ample data protection.

## § 3 Change or Deletion of Personal Data

Users may change their personal data at any time (such as by updating or correcting them) or delete their data entirely. If a user wants upjers to change his/her personal data or stops using his/her personal data, the user may contact upjers via datenschutzbeauftragter@upjers.com. upjers will change or delete this user data as quickly as possible. Due to technical or organizational conditions it might be possible that some measures will still need to be carried out even after the demand of deletion, should these already have begun but haven't been completed after the user has informed upjers of his/her wish to be deleted.

## § 4 Separate Notes

**1\. Use of the Scalabe Central Measurement Method**

Upjers uses the "Scalable Central Measurement Method / Skalierbares Zentrales Messverfahren" (SZM) for several of its websites (so far My Free Farm, Molehill Empire, Kapi Hospital and Upologus) of [INFOnline](https://www.infonline.de/) to determine statistical parameters in the scope of Upjers' services. In doing so, anonymous measures are collected. For the recognition of computer systems, the SZM audience measurement uses alternatively either a cookie with the identifier "ivwbox.de" or a signature which is created from various information that is automatically transferred by your computer. IP addresses are not stored via this method and only processed in anonymized form. The audience measurement was developed in consideration of data protection. The goal of the audience measurement is to statistically determine user intensity and the number of users of a specific website. Individual users are not identified at any point in time. Their identity is always protected. They will not receive any advertizing via the system.  
For websites which are members of the IVW German Audit Bureau of Circulation (Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V., [www.ivw.eu](http://www.ivw.eu/) or that participate in the study "Internet Facts", organized by the Work Group Online Research (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V., [AGOF](http://www.agof.de/)), user statistics are published monthly by the AGOF and the AGMA (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V., [ag.ma](http://www.agma-mmc.de/)), as well as the IVW and can be viewed at [http://www.agof.de](http://www.agof.de/), [http://www.agma-mmc.de](http://www.agma-mmc.de/) and [http://www.ivw.eu](http://www.ivw.eu/). In addition to the publication of measurement data, the IVW also regularly checks the SZM process to ensure that it is used in accordance with regulations and data protection. You can find additional information about the SZM process on the website of INFOonline GmbH ([https://www.infonline.de](https://www.infonline.de/)), the operators of the SZM process, as well as the data protection website of AGOF (<http://www.agof.de/datenschutz>) and the data protection website of IVW ([http://www.ivw.eu](http://www.ivw.eu/)).
