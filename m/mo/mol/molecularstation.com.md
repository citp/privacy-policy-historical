Molecular Station understands your privacy and will not sell or give this information to outside sources.

Molecular Station collects personal information about you only when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us, such as forum and blog registration purposes. 

This personal information that you provide to Molecular Station will not be made available to third parties outside of Molecular Station without your explicit permission. Your personal information will be used to personalize and enhance your experience with Molecular Station.

### The Use of Cookies

Cookies are data which a web site transfers to an individual's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can enhance the web by making it more useful by storing your preferences for a particular site. The use of cookies is an internet and industry standard, and many if not most major web sites use them to provide enhanced features for their users. 

Molecular Station has two primary uses for its cookies. We use them primarily to specify your unique preferences, and to make it easier for you to use our forum and other registration areas. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns on Molecular Station. This enables us to better understand and improve areas of Molecular Station Service. While these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to Molecular Station always have the option of disabling cookies through their internet browser preferences or options.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You either can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or indicate when a cookie is being sent, or block cookies from Molecular Station. However, some Molecular Station Services such as our forum may not function properly if you refuse cookies. 

### External Links and Links to other Sites and Servers 

Molecular Station contains many links to other sites. Those sites may not have the same privacy standards as Molecular Station. These sites may send their own cookies to users, and consequently collect personal information and data that Molecular Station would not. 

Users should be aware that when you are on Molecular Station, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Molecular Station pages that take you outside our service. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Take note and caution when proceeding to other sites.

Molecular Station's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Molecular Station's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
