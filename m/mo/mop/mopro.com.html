                                        Like most corporate websites, we collect information about clients and prospective
                                        clients for one principal reason: it helps us to better serve you. Such information
                                        keeps us focused and nimble, better able to respond quickly to trends and changes
                                        in the marketplace – and that, of course, helps all of our clients. It helps us
                                        improve your experience on our websites and assures that we can communicate with
                                        you about your account; it better equips us to develop services that cater to your
                                        particular needs; it helps us provide you with the most relevant products, services
                                        and programs. It's also the best way of ensuring that you get to take advantage

                                        registration forms to Mopro, and non-Personal Information that we collect automatically

                                        Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual,
                                        including, but not limited to, your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail
                                        address, and credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification
                                        value, and the billing address. The types and amount of Personal Information collected

                                        Other information we gather includes aggregated tracking information derived mainly
                                        by tallying page views throughout our sites. This non-Personal Information also
                                        covers things like click-throughs, IP addresses, and usage data, and it may at times
                                        be combined with your Personal Information. All of this allows us to better tailor
                                        our content to our users' individual needs.</p>

                                        Mopro only collects Personal Information that we consider necessary for providing

                                        any identifying Personal Information. If you'd like to view the entire site or sign

                                        in developing services that help you achieve your business objectives, and we may

                                        use it to improve our customer support and client services, to troubleshoot other
                                        problems or resolve disputes, or for other business purposes. If you are referred
