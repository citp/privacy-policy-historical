                        <p>
                            Moshtix’s primary role is to provide event publishing, registration, ticketing and related software and services to Australian, New Zealand, US, UK and other International users of Moshtix and the Moshtix platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moshtix recognises the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about our customers. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the word customers includes visitors to our web sites, subscribers to and users of our services, purchasers of our products and advertising customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) in relation to the handling of personal information. Where appropriate we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption (but complying with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards), related bodies corporate exemption and the employee exemption in the Privacy Act.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Personal Information</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We collect personal information when we provide our services to you. Generally we will tell you why we are collecting information when we collect it and how we plan to use it or these things will be obvious when we collect the information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also acquire lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have registered a Moshtix account with us, we will hold your contact and billing details. Those details are primarily used to send you information about the Moshtix platform, any upgrades that become available, new developments, upgrades and forthcoming features and to charge you for service fees. If you have booked or registered for events that are listed by an EVENT ORGANISER using Moshtix and the Moshtix platform, we keep a record of your booking data to report to the EVENT ORGANISER. This booking data may be used in future event marketing campaigns by the EVENT ORGANISER and Moshtix. We will also keep a record of your billing information to allow you to make quick purchases by simply using an email address and password to login to your Moshtix account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can opt-out of receiving email campaigns during the ticket purchase or registration process by logging into your moshfile at <a href="http://www.moshtix.com.au">www.moshtix.com.au</a> and unchecking the EVENT ORGANISER radio button on the MAILING LISTS tab.

                            If you have booked through a Moshtix Retail Associate and then registered your Moshtix moshcard, where you have opted-in to receive updates by email or SMS, this registration data may be used in future event marketing campaigns by the EVENT ORGANISER for which the moshcard was allocated tickets, by the Moshtix Retail Associate through which you purchased your tickets to update you on store based information and by Moshtix. You can opt-in to receiving these campaigns during the moshcard registration process.                         
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All moshcard registrations are managed online.

                            Software piracy seriously impacts the software industry worldwide. From time to time Moshtix receives reports of suspected piracy and investigates those reports. Software piracy may be a criminal offence, and sometimes an investigation is undertaken. Whilst most reports concern piracy by businesses, some personal information may be collected.
