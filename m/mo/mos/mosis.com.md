Most of this essential information refers to the commercial concerns, governmental organizations, and educational institutions that hold accounts with MOSIS, and not to individuals. 

We request e-mail addresses in order to facilitate communications with designers and account liaisons. Interested persons may voluntarily give us their e-mail address so that they can receive the occasional announcements that MOSIS distributes to our user community. Account contact and newsletter e-mail address lists are never disclosed outside MOSIS or made available to any other organization or institution. 

Participants in the MOSIS Educational Program (MEP) may be asked, as a condition of participation, to permit disclosure by MOSIS of some general information about their submitted and fabricated designs to the foundry in which they fabricate their designs. 

Statistical analysis of demographics, account type, and fabrication technologies is required to keep MOSIS’ business focused on customer needs.

No personal data is included in analysis data.
