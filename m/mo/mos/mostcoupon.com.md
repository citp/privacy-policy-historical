[Updated: 1 November, 2013]

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the MostCoupon.com services. We have designed this policy to help you understand how we collect and use the information you decide to share, so that you make informed decisions when using the MostCoupon.com services.

If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at [**Contact Us**](http://www.mostcoupon.com/contact-us "Contact Us - MostCoupon.com").

**Information We Collect**

As with most websites, we collect the following two types of information: (1) Personally identifiable information that is voluntarily provided by users (i.e., information that a user provides that allows us to identify and contact that user, such as their name, address or email), and (2) Non-personally identifiable information (e.g., information that is automatically collected such as the type of web browser, IP address, etc., that does not by itself identify a specific individual).

We only collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us. If you do not want this information to be collected by us, please do not submit it.

Additionally, should a user contact MostCoupon.com on his/her own initiative or respond to a communication from MostCoupon.com, we may collect the information submitted.

**Cookies, Log Files and Web Beacons**

Like most websites, MostCoupon.com uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows MostCoupon.com to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. The cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the website.

The cookies we use do not store any personally identifiable information about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies. Please be aware, though, that if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features offered on our websites.

Like most websites as part of the communication standards on the Internet, we use log files on our servers. These log files store various non-personally identifiable data regarding your visit with us, such as the internet protocol (IP) addresses, information regarding your browser, internet service provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, platform type, and number and identification of clicks. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the MostCoupon.com services. Additionally, this information may also be used to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the MostCoupon.com services, or to display the content according to your preferences. This and other anonymous information collected may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.

**Coupon Codes and Links to Merchants**

When clicking on coupon codes or other links to merchants on the MostCoupon.com site, you will be sent, via a new Web browser window, directly to the merchant’s site to complete your transaction.

No one under age 18 is eligible to use our services, and we do not direct any of our content specifically at children who are under 18 years of age. MostCoupon.com does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on MostCoupon.com. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
