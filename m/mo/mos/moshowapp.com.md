**PRIVACY POLICY**

Last updated May 24, 2018

PICADELIC (“we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application MoShow (the “Application”).   Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

If we make any changes to this policy, we will change the “Last updated” date above. You should periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of any updates. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you.  We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party. 

**COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Picadelic does not collect personally identifiable information from our users. We do not ask you to register to use the App or collect your name or e-mail address. All photos and videos remain on your device unless shared by you.
