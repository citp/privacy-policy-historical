##  Privacy Policy 

MockQuestions LLC, referred to here as (MockQuestions), is committed to protecting your privacy. Our privacy policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information about you or associated with you ('personal information'). 

  


  1. ### How We Collect and Use Information

MockQuestions to its aware knowledge, does not collect any long lived personal information about you. We do create a session id that tracks your interview questions and answers and is only available for a brief amount of time, roughly 30 minutes. After the estimated 30 minutes, the information collected is no longer tied directly to you or your device so long as your submitted interview answers do not reveal personal information about you. We strongly encourage all users of MockQuestions not to submit personal information. MockQuestions uses the service of Google Analytics to help us understand how individuals use our service. MockQuestions may also use the services of other third party developers for analytical purposes. 

  

  2. ### How To Avoid Submitting Personal Information

When filling out interview answers, please do not reveal your name, age, and location. Whenever you see a textbox area, with a submit button of any sort, please be aware that any text you enter into the textarea and then click submit (or send, post, go, etc), becomes property of MockQuestions and therefore, we strongly advise you to NOT submit any personal information that may reveal your identity to anyone who visits Mockquestions.com. For any further questions on this, please contact us at mockquestions@gmail.com before beginning your use of MockQuestions. 

  

  3. ### How We Share Information

MockQuestions may use your interview answers on other websites owned by MockQuestions or third party websites.
