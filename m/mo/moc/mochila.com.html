                              <p>Mochila, Inc. ("Mochila," "we," "us")  is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how  we collect, use and disclose your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy (the "Policy")  describes our practices in connection with personally identifiable information  that we collect through our website located at <a href="http://www.mochila.com">http://www.mochila.com</a> (the "Site").&nbsp; This Policy does  not govern our collection of information through any web site, or by any other  means, other than through the Site, nor does this Policy govern the collection  of information by any of our affiliates (collectively, "Affiliated  Entities").<strong> </strong></p>
                              <p>The Site is controlled and operated by Mochila from the United  States, and is not intended to subject Mochila to the laws or jurisdiction of  any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.&nbsp; Mochila does not represent or warrant that  the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any  particular jurisdiction.&nbsp; Those who  choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk,  and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of  this Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the  terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site.&nbsp; We reserve the right to change this Policy without  prior notice.&nbsp; You can determine when  this Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last Updated"  legend at the top of this page.&nbsp; Any  changes to our Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised Policy  on the Internet, accessible through the Site.&nbsp;  Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of  the revised Policy then in effect.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>This Policy  represents the sole, authorized statement of Mochila's practices with respect  to the collection of Personal Information (defined below) through the Site and Mochila's  use of such information.&nbsp; Any summaries  of this Policy generated by third party software or otherwise (for example, in  connection with the "Platform for Privacy Preferences" or  "P3P") shall have no legal effect, do not bind Mochila, shall not be  relied upon in substitute for this Policy, and neither supersede nor modify  this Policy.&nbsp; This Policy is in the  English language.&nbsp; Any translation of  this Policy shall have no legal validity.&nbsp;  In the event of any inconsistency between the English language version  hereof and any translation of this Policy into another language, this English  language version will govern.</p>
                              <p><strong>Note  Regarding the Use of This Site by Children: </strong>The Site is  not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that  such individuals do not provide personally identifiable information through the  Site.&nbsp; Further, we discourage individuals  between ages 13 and 18 from using this site absent parental supervision.</p>
                              <p><strong>1. What Types of Information Does Mochila  Collect Via the Site? </strong></p>
                              <p>Mochila gathers two basic types of information through the  Site: "Personally Identifiable Information" (or "PII") and  "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" (or  "Non-PII").&nbsp; Personally  Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as a specific  individual; that is, your name, postal address, telephone number, e‑mail  address, or your credit card number.&nbsp; PII  does not include information about any company or organization with which you  work, or any newspaper, magazine or other publication with which you may be  associated (for example, the name of your employer or publication).&nbsp; In contrast, Non-Personally Identifiable  Information includes aggregated information, demographic information, IP  addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific  identity.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally  Identifiable Information.&nbsp; </strong>You do not  have to provide PII to us to access the Site.&nbsp;  However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities  provided through the Site (for example, to apply for membership or participate  in surveys, contests, sweepstakes, raffles or other similar promotions), we may  require that you furnish PII.&nbsp; We collect  PII from you only when you voluntarily provide it to us.&nbsp; Please note, however, that any personally  identifiable information contained in any Offered Content (as defined in our  Member Terms) – for example, the names of reporters and people featured or  quoted in any Offered Content – is considered to be public information, and  does not constitute PII under this Privacy Policy.</p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp; </strong>When you visit and  interact with the Site, Mochila and third parties with whom Mochila has  contracted to provide services to Mochila may collect Non-PII (for example, a  catalog of the Site pages that you visit).&nbsp;  Non-PII is generally collected from four different sources:&nbsp; server log files, cookies, clear GIFs and  information that you voluntarily provide. </p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Server Log Files.&nbsp; </strong>Your Internet  Protocol (IP) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned  to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; This number is identified and logged  automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with  the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.&nbsp; Collecting IP addresses is standard practice  on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies.&nbsp; </strong>Cookies are data that  a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping  purposes.&nbsp; Cookies are an industry  standard used by most web sites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to  and use of a particular web site.&nbsp;  Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files, and only  the web site that transferred a particular cookie can read, modify or delete  such cookie.&nbsp; If you do not want  information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure  in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be  given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie,  or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clear GIFs.</strong> &nbsp;Additionally, we or our service providers may  use so-called “clear GIFs”, “pixel tags”,&nbsp;  “web beacons” or similar means (collectively, “Clear GIFs”)&nbsp; in some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail  messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage  and response rates and help manage our web site reports.&nbsp; A Clear GIF is an electronic image, often a  single-pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site users and may be  associated with cookies on our users’ hard drives.&nbsp; These Clear GIFs provide us and our service  providers with the ability to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser  visits this site.&nbsp; Clear GIFs also allow  us and our service providers to count users who have visited certain pages of  the Site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising  campaigns.&nbsp; When used in HTML-formatted  e-mail messages, Clear GIFs can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has  been opened.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information  That You Voluntarily Provide.</strong>&nbsp;  Mochila also collects Non-PII (e.g., your interests, your geographic  location and so forth) when you voluntarily provide such information to  us.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p><strong>2.  How Does Mochila Use Information Collected on the Site? &nbsp;</strong> </p>
                              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally  Identifiable Information.&nbsp; </strong>Mochila  may use your PII to provide you with Site‑related services.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Subject to your right to  opt-out (see "Opt-Out" section below), we may also use your PII to  inform you of products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
                              <p>When you make a  purchase through the Site, we may collect your credit card number, billing  address and other information related to such purchase (collectively, "Payment  Information") from you, and may use such Payment Information in order to  fulfill your purchase.&nbsp; We may also  provide such Payment Information to third parties as necessary to complete your  purchase (for example, to process your credit card).&nbsp; Additionally, if you participate in a  purchase made through the Site, either as a buyer/republisher or a  seller/licensor, we may provide your PII to any other users who participate in  such purchase as necessary to fulfill such purchase (for example, to inform the  seller/licensor who the buyer/republisher is, and vice versa).&nbsp; To the extent that Payment Information  includes non-PII, use of such non-PII is governed by Section 2.b below.</p>
                              <p>We may operate  sweepstakes, contests, raffles and similar promotions through the Site. &nbsp;We typically ask you for certain PII when you  enter and, if applicable, win a sweepstakes, contest, raffle or similar  promotion. &nbsp;We will use the PII provided  to contact winners and award prizes.&nbsp; In  addition, we reserve the right to share this PII with third parties sponsors of  such sweepstakes, contests, raffles and promotions (irrespective of whether it  is hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such  sweepstakes, contest, raffle or promotion. &nbsp;You should carefully review the rules of each  sweepstakes, contest, raffle and promotion in which you participate through the  Site, as they may contain additional important information about Mochila’s or a  sponsor's use of your PII. &nbsp;To the extent  that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your  Personal Information conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of  such rules shall control. </p>
                              <p>We may also provide  you with the opportunity to complete a survey on the Site.&nbsp; PII collected through surveys will be used  for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use of the Site. &nbsp;</p>
                              <p>We may offer users  the opportunity to participate in discussions in Mochila’s discussion  threads.&nbsp; If you use Mochila’s discussion  threads, you should be aware that any PII you submit in any discussion thread  (including any PII you may choose to make available to other users through your  user profile) becomes public information, and can be read, collected, or used  by other users of discussion threads, and could be used to send you unsolicited  messages. &nbsp;We are not responsible for the  PII you choose to submit in these discussion threads, and we urge you to exercise  discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your PII, or any other  information, in any discussion thread.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>From time  to time, in our sole discretion, we may use your PII to e-mail to you important  information regarding the Site, your purchases, issues regarding Offered  Content or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies ("Administrative  E-mails").&nbsp; Because this information  may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving  these Administrative E-mails.</p>
                              <p>Further,  notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve  the right to disclose your PII if we believe that we are required to do so (a)  by law; (b) to comply with legal process or governmental requests; (c) to  enforce our Terms of Service; (d)&nbsp;to fulfill our contractual obligations,  including fulfilling our users’ audit rights, if any; (e) to protect our  operations or those of any Affiliated Entities; (f) to protect the rights, privacy,  safety or property of Mochila, the Affiliated Entities, you or others; and (g)  to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may  sustain.&nbsp; Moreover, we may, to the  fullest extent the law allows, disclose PII about you to law enforcement  agencies to assist them in identifying individuals who have been or may be  engaged in unlawful activities.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Personally  Identifiable Information.&nbsp; </strong>Because  Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>In  addition, we reserve the right to share such Non‑PII, which does not personally  identify you, with Affiliated Entities and other third parties, for any  purpose.</p>
                              <p><strong>3. Other Important Notes Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</strong></p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third  Party Service Providers.&nbsp; </strong>We  work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to web  site hosting, data analysis and other services of an administrative  nature.&nbsp; We reserve the right to share  your PII with such third parties solely for the purpose of enabling such third  parties to provide such services.</p>
