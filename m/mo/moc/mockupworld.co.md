### Google Analytics

Traffic analysis helps Mockup World to identify popular parts of the site, such as mockups genres or other services and shows ways in which way to grow. That is why the site uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc, (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; “Google”). The use includes the “Universal Analytics” operating mode. This facilitates the assignment of data, sessions, and interactions across several devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus the analysis of a user’s activities across devices. 

Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to allow the website operator to analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. IP anonymization is activated on this website, that means Google will reduce your IP address within Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide the website operator with other services related to website and Internet use. The legitimate interest in data processing also lies in these purposes. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is § 15 para. 3 TMG and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The data sent by us and linked to cookies, user-identifiers (e.g. User-IDs) or advertising-identifiers are automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.

Mockup World uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to Mockup World as the site operator.

In order to operate the site and avoid misuse of the service the log file of the ISO 27001-certified server stores the IP address, the browser visitors use, the time and date of the visits, and the system that visitors use. Teh hoster Hetzner only stores pseudonymized IP addresses of visitors to the website. At the web server level, this happens by default by storing an IP address 123.123.123.XXX in the log file instead of the visitor’s actual IP address, for example, 123.123.123.123. The “XXX” is a random value between 1 and 254, so it is no longer possible to establish the true identity of the visitor.
