### What Personal Information Does Mochi Media display or Collect?

We collect the following types of information from our users. 

  * #### Personal Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you enter on the Websites or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your name, age, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, and payment information . You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information.

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Mochi Media only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Websites or services so that we can make the Websites appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Websites, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.

  * #### E-mail Communications:

We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Mochi Media if your computer supports this type of program. Mochi Media uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. 

  * #### What About Cookies?
