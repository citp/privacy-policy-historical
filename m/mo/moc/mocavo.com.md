### 5\. Record Matching

Findmypast uses record matching technologies to suggest possible matches between historical records on Findmypast and associated partner trees. 

Record matching on Findmypast automatically matches historical records for your family tree. These records are pulled from our vast database of over 8 billion records. Record matching will save you time with your research and allow you to make fascinating discoveries through birth, marriage and death documents and census records.

When record matching is enabled within the partner site, information from small parts of your family tree is passed between the sites without you having to do anything, to a matching service on the Findmypast website. This information includes basic information such as names, dates and places associated with individuals and their close relatives. Findmypast uses this data to find accurate matches for relevant individuals. Please note this information is not retained by Findmypast and is deleted automatically after matches are calculated and displayed to you. Only partner site users receive Findmypast hints, Findmypast users do not receive hints about trees on the partner site.

The partner site will show matches in its search window where matches are found. To find out more about these matches, click on the links provided and review them; you will then have the ability to accept or reject matches. Please note that some of the matches can be viewed and confirmed for free, while others require a Findmypast data subscription.
