## What information we collect and how we use it

Moqups collects the following information about you when you provide it to us and use our services:

### Account and Profile Information

When you sign up, create a profile, set your preferences, or pay for your subscription, Moqups collects your name, username, password, email, address, company information, and any profile pictures or avatars you choose to upload.

> We use this information to correctly identify you, communicate with you, and provide you with customer support. We also use this contact information for accounting and administrative purposes, for transactional emails including app and billing notifications, and to notify you about new features, releases, blog posts, and discounts.

### User Created Content

As you work on your projects, Moqups stores the content you create, send, receive, and share. This includes any assets you upload to Moqups, such as images, icons, or logos. It also includes comments posted to your projects by you, your team members, and your collaborators.

> We use this information to securely store your work, and provide access to your team members and the collaborators you designate.

### Device Information and Log Data

We collect information about the type of device you use to access Moqups, as well as your device settings, operating system, browser information, connection type, IP address, and the URLs of referring pages. Additionally, we log the date and time you access our services, as well as any error or crash data.

> We use device and location information to help us optimize your Moqups’ display and performance, provide accurate billing information, understand user demographics, and improve overall user experience. Your log data helps us troubleshoot errors, analyze performance, resolve reliability issues, perform security audits, and investigate potential service fraud or abuse.

### Payment Information

Customers that purchase a paid Moqups subscription provide us, or our payment processors, with billing details such as credit or debit card information, banking information, and billing addresses. When you purchase a subscription through one of our payment processors, we receive only partial information about your card, and Moqups doesn’t store cardholder information on our servers.

> We use your payment information in order to fulfil, track, and manage your subscription.

### Service Metadata

This data is generated automatically, when you visit Moqups. It provides us with information about how you browse our website and use our app. That includes the links you click, the search terms you use, and the features you access.

> We use this metadata to help us understand how our users work, and what they find most valuable at Moqups. We also use this information to measure the efficiency of our product, enhance our services and guide our future development.

### Support Information

When you reach out to Moqups, you may contact our team through the service of a third-party support platform. The information you provide to our team, including any troubleshooting documentation or screen shots, are saved as part of your support history.

> We use this information to resolve any issues you are having, relay feedback to our team, respond to your comments and requests, and confirm your purchases and refunds. We also use this data to provide you with security alerts and technical notices.

### Cookie Information

Moqups and our third-party advertising and analytics partners use cookies and similar technologies for tracking across different devices, websites and online services.

> We use this information both for secure authentication and for the maintenance of your active sessions. Our third-party partners use cookies for the purposes of marketing, ad targeting, and performance analytics.

### Integrations and Linked Services

Moqups offers integrations with a number of third-party services. For instance, you can sign up and log into Moqups by using Google, Slack, and other third-party authentication providers. You can also connect your Moqups account to Google Drive and Dropbox in order to be able to export and save your projects there. We also offer add-ons to Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence platforms.

Whenever you or your account owner links to one of these third-party services, Moqups is authorized to connect and transfer information as specified by our agreement with that linked service.

> We use this information to authenticate, connect, or link your third-party accounts to Moqups. However, we do not receive or store passwords for any of these third-party services.
> 
> To understand what data may be shared with Moqups when you enable these integrations, please check the settings, permissions and privacy policies of these third-party services.

### Information Provided by Other Users

Other Moqups users may provide contact information about you when they share content, or when they invite you to collaborate on a project.

> We use this information to facilitate collaboration, and to help you communicate with your team members and stakeholders.

### We Do Not Sell Your Information

Moqups users create and share sensitive and proprietary data on our platform. Since we appreciate our users’ need for privacy, we adhere to a straightforward business model based on the offer of both paid subscriptions and free plans. This means that, no matter what Moqups plan you choose, we will never sell information about you, your profile, your projects, nor your data and metadata, to advertising companies or other third parties.

### Other Moqups Users

Moqups is a collaborative platform that’s designed to let you share and disseminate your work. This means you are free to invite your peers to view, comment, download, or edit collaboratively in real time, depending on the settings that you select. You can also choose to make your work publically available. In addition, you may also grant your team members project access rights that are equivalent to yours, including the ability to transfer your project ownership to a different account. Some of these collaborative features display your publicly accessible profile information to the other users you’ve invited to collaborate.

### Community and Forums

Moqups offers publicly accessible blogs and community forums. Any comments you contribute to these platforms may be read, collected or used by any member of the public who chooses to access them. Your information may remain posted on these sites, even if your account is deleted at your request.

### Testimonials and Case Studies

We might contact you with a request to provide information that would appear, as a testimonial or case study, on our blog and website. In this case, we would seek explicit, written consent to use this information.

### Social Media Links and Third-Party Widgets

Some Moqups services include social media links and widgets. In order to function properly, these features may set a cookie that records the Moqups page from which you engaged them, as well as your IP address. These features may also link to other websites or services whose privacy policies differ from ours. As a result, any information you provide to them will be governed by their policies and not this one.

### Third-Party App Integrations

Moqups users are free to allow third-party apps and integrations to connect to their Moqups account. Once enabled, Moqups may share information with those services. Moqups does not control the way in which these services collect, share, or use information. Because of this, Moqups users should review the privacy policies of all third-party services before connecting to, or using their applications.

### Legal Compliance and Fraud Prevention

In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose information about you to a third party if we receive a request and believe that the disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We may also do so to enforce our Terms of Service, investigate potential violations, prevent and detect fraud, track and solve security or technical issues, and protect against any harm to the rights, property or safety of Moqups, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

### Changes in Business

If Moqups engages in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, dissolution, sale of company assets, financing, public offering of securities, or due diligence and other steps in contemplation and negotiation of such activities, we may share or transfer information that we collect under this privacy policy, subject to standard confidentiality agreements.

## How we store, secure, and transfer information

We conduct regular, manual and automated security audits.
