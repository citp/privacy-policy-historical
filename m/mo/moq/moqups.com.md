# Moqups - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

Effective as of: March 1, 2012

Evercoder Software owns and provides various websites (the " **Websites** "), services, and software (such as www.moqups.com) that facilitate online mockups or other type of content creation and sharing (collectively, the " **Services** "). Evercoder Software respects your privacy and values your trust. In this Privacy Policy, we may refer to Evercoder Software as " **Evercoder** ", " **us** ", or " **we** ". " **User** " shall refer to any individual or organization using the Services.

The following Privacy Policy outlines how Evercoder will treat information as you use the Services. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND IN OUR TERMS OF USE.

Evercoder reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, update, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without notice to you. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of those changes.

## Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")

PII is any piece of information which can be traced back to a specific individual user and thus potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that specific individual or any sensitive information, such as credit card numbers. Examples of PII include names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, and other unique identifiers. In no event will Evercoder (i) use PII to market its services or those of a third party, or (ii) sell or transfer PII to third parties, or otherwise provide third parties with access thereto, except as specifically provided in this Privacy Policy and/or in our applicable Terms of Use.

Users choosing to use the Services may be required to register or create an account through the Services. In order to register or create an account, we may ask any such User to provide information including, but not limited to, that person's name, email address, and location. We may also collect user submitted information, including but not limited to ratings & reviews of content created using the Services. We may retain any emails, letters, messages, postings, or other correspondence between you and Evercoder to ensure quality control and the best possible service, although we have no obligation to do so.

We may also ask Users to provide a valid credit card number and billing address or Paypal Account information so that we can process any payments for use of the Services by such User, pursuant to our Terms of Use. We will not make any credit card information available to anyone except for third party companies we partner with to process credit card payments. We will not store any credit card information on our servers.

In the event that Evercoder discovers that PII has been compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose PII has been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth below.

## Use of Personally Identifiable Information

We do not intentionally provide PII to third parties except where you provide PII as part of a) registering or signing up to view content created using the Services, where registration is required to view that content, or b) indicating interest in an advertiser on the Services. In the above situations, we may provide that information to the appropriate businesses or individuals so that they may contact you about their services or provide you with information regarding the advertised products or services about which you inquired, as applicable.

We may use PII and any other information provided by User through the Services for internal purposes, such as sales, human resources, marketing, and administration. We may share this information with third parties who provide us with administrative services, such as credit card or PayPal Account processing. If we share any of the information collected from you with such a third party, their use of that information will be governed by their privacy policy.

If you or any other user of the Services sends an email to Evercoder for any reason, we reserve the right to retain that email address to use to send future notifications in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked to a specific individual. Examples of non-personally identifiable information include, but are not limited to, log files, web beacons, the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, your IP address, the time and date of your use of the Services, and whether or not you clicked on hypertext links within the Services. We may collect non-personally identifiable information while you use the Services.

## Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We may use the non-personally identifiable information to generate user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners, and that we may use to enhance your experience using and generally improve the Services. If we provide any such information to others, we will provide such information in the aggregate only and will not include any personally identifiable information about any individual users. We may also use the non-personally identifiable information to generate statistics that we may provide to you and to other businesses using the Services, including, for example, the number of appointments in a certain time period. We also may provide non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform services for us.

## Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive to identify your computer to our servers. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, we will use cookies to recognize your computer when you visit the Services so that we can provide you with a more personalized and streamlined experience and improve the quality of the Services. If you wish, you can configure your browser to block cookies. If you block cookies, however, it may impair the functionality of the Services.

Advertisements of third-party advertisers may be displayed on the Services. If you choose to click on a third-party advertisement or link, we may provide non-personally identifiable information to the owning advertiser and/or web publisher. Also, any such advertiser or web publisher may use cookies or other technologies to collect information when you are visiting their web sites. The information advertisers or other third parties collect is governed by their individual privacy policies. Evercoder does not take responsibility nor can guarantee the content of such third-party privacy policies.

## Notifications

We reserve the right to notify you through e-mail, facsimiles, text or voice messages, written or hard copy notices, messages posted to your user account, or notices posted on the Evercoder websites, as determined by Evercoder in our discretion or as otherwise required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Evercoder reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our customers or web site users. By using the Services, you consent to receiving such notifications.

Where applicable, you may opt-out of receiving certain notifications through the Services by logging into their Evercoder account and changing the notification settings; opting-out of such notifications, however, will limit the effectiveness of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Users may not opt-out of receiving notifications relating to support of the Services or other notices as required by law. If we have provided any third party with your personal information, you will have to contact the third-party directly with any opt-out request.

## Other Sharing of Information

We may release information when necessary to comply with the law or a court order or an investigation. We also may release information to law enforcement to protect our rights, property, or other interests, including those of our customers or users or to prevent illegal activities or violations of our Terms of Use.

In the event that we, in whole or in part, establish a partnership with another company, or are acquired by or merged with another company, information we collect may be transferred to the partner or the acquiring or merging company at time such merger, acquisition, or partnership is closed and to the extent necessary to fulfill our obligations under such merger, acquisition, or partnership.

## Child Protection

We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13\. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13 from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts.

## Security

We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure, but we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your PII for improper purposes. We cannot ensure the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet, and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure of such information. You acknowledge that you provide your PII at your own risk.

## Compromise of Personal Information

In the event that PII is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose PII has been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth above.
