	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>Effective as of: March 1, 2012</p>

	<p>Evercoder Software owns and
	provides various websites (the "<b>Websites</b>"), services, and software (such
	as www.moqups.com) that facilitate online mockups or other type of content creation
	and sharing (collectively, the "<b>Services</b>"). Evercoder Software respects
	your privacy and values your trust. In this Privacy Policy, we may refer to
	Evercoder Software as "<b>Evercoder</b>", "<b>us</b>", or "<b>we</b>". "<b>User</b>"
	shall refer to any individual or organization using the Services.</p>

	<p>The following Privacy
	Policy outlines how Evercoder will treat information as you use the
	Services.&nbsp;BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS
	PRIVACY POLICY AND IN OUR TERMS OF USE.</p>

	<p>Evercoder reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change,
	modify, update, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time,
	with or without notice to you. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically
	for changes. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of any changes
	to the Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of those changes.</p>

	<h2>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")</h2>

	<p>PII is any piece of information which can be traced back to a
	specific individual user and thus potentially be used to uniquely identify,
	contact, or locate that specific individual or any sensitive information, such
	as credit card numbers. Examples of PII include names, telephone numbers,
	social security numbers, and other unique identifiers. In no event will Evercoder
	(i) use PII to market its services or those of a third party, or (ii) sell or
	transfer PII to third parties, or otherwise provide third parties with access
	thereto, except as specifically provided in this Privacy Policy and/or in our
	applicable Terms of Use.</p>

	<p>Users choosing to use the Services may be required to register
	or create an account through the Services. In order to register or create an
	account, we may ask any such User to provide information including, but not
	limited to, that person's name, email address, and location. We may also
	collect user submitted information, including but not limited to ratings &amp;
	reviews of content created using the Services. We may retain any emails,
	letters, messages, postings, or other correspondence between you and Evercoder to
	ensure quality control and the best possible service, although we have no
	obligation to do so.</p>

	<p>We may also ask Users to provide a valid credit card number and
	billing address or Paypal Account information so that we can process any
	payments for use of the Services by such User, pursuant to our Terms of Use. We
	will not make any credit card information available to anyone except for third
	party companies we partner with to process credit card payments. We will not
	store any credit card information on our servers.</p>

	<p>In the event that Evercoder discovers that PII has been
	compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those
	persons whose PII has been compromised in accordance with the notification
	procedures set forth below.</p>

	<h2>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

	<p>We do not intentionally provide PII to third parties except
	where you provide PII as part of a) registering or signing up to view content
	created using the Services, where registration is required to view that
	content, or b) indicating interest in an advertiser on the Services. In the
	above situations, we may provide that information to the appropriate businesses
	or individuals so that they may contact you about their services or provide you
	with information regarding the advertised products or services about which you
	inquired, as applicable.</p>

	<p>We may use PII and any other information provided by User through
	the Services for internal purposes, such as sales, human resources, marketing,
	and administration. We may share this information with third parties who
	provide us with administrative services, such as credit card or PayPal Account
	processing. If we share any of the information collected from you with such a
	third party, their use of that information will be governed by their privacy
	policy.</p>

	<p>If you or any other user of the Services sends an email to
	Evercoder for any reason, we reserve the right to retain that email address to
	use to send future notifications in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our
	Terms of Use.</p>

	<h2>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

	<p>Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by
	itself, cannot be tracked to a specific individual. Examples of non-personally
	identifiable information include, but are not limited to, log files, web
	beacons, the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer
	operating system you are using, your IP address, the time and date of your use
	of the Services, and whether or not you clicked on hypertext links within the
	Services. We may collect non-personally identifiable information while you use
	the Services.</p>

	<h2>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

	<p>We may use the non-personally identifiable information to
	generate user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or
	partners, and that we may use to enhance your experience using and generally
	improve the Services. If we provide any such information to others, we will
	provide such information in the aggregate only and will not include any
	personally identifiable information about any individual users. We may also use
	the non-personally identifiable information to generate statistics that we may
	provide to you and to other businesses using the Services, including, for
	example, the number of appointments in a certain time period. We also may
	provide non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can
	perform services for us.</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>

	<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's
	hard drive to identify your computer to our servers. If your browser is
	configured to accept cookies, we will use cookies to recognize your computer
	when you visit the Services so that we can provide you with a more personalized
	and streamlined experience and improve the quality of the Services. If you
	wish, you can configure your browser to block cookies. If you block cookies,
	however, it may impair the functionality of the Services.</p>

	<p>Advertisements of third-party advertisers may be displayed on
	the Services. If you choose to click on a third-party advertisement or link, we
	may provide non-personally identifiable information to the owning advertiser
	and/or web publisher. Also, any such advertiser or web publisher may use
	cookies or other technologies to collect information when you are visiting
	their web sites. The information advertisers or other third parties collect is
	governed by their individual privacy policies. Evercoder does not take
	responsibility nor can guarantee the content of such third-party privacy
	policies.</p>

	<h2>Notifications</h2>

	<p>We reserve the right to notify you through e-mail, facsimiles,
	text or voice messages, written or hard copy notices, messages posted to your
	user account, or notices posted on the Evercoder websites, as determined by
	Evercoder in our discretion or as otherwise required by law. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, Evercoder reserves the right to determine the form and means of
	providing notifications to our customers or web site users. By using the
	Services, you consent to receiving such notifications.</p>

	<p>Where applicable, you may opt-out of receiving certain
	notifications through the Services by logging into their Evercoder account and
	changing the notification settings; opting-out of such notifications, however,
	will limit the effectiveness of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
	Users may not opt-out of receiving notifications relating to support of the
	Services or other notices as required by law. If we have provided any third
	party with your personal information, you will have to contact the third-party
	directly with any opt-out request.</p>

	<h2>Other Sharing of Information</h2>

	<p>We may release information
	when necessary to comply with the law or a court order or an investigation. We
	also may release information to law enforcement to protect our rights,
	property, or other interests, including those of our customers or users or to
	prevent illegal activities or violations of our Terms of Use.</p>

	<p>In the event that we, in whole or in part, establish a
	partnership with another company, or are acquired by or merged with another
	company, information we collect may be transferred to the partner or the
	acquiring or merging company at time such merger, acquisition, or partnership
	is closed and to the extent necessary to fulfill our obligations under such
	merger, acquisition, or partnership.</p>

	<h2>Child Protection</h2>

	<p>We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of
	13. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will
	purge any information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13
	from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts.</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and
	organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from
	accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure,
	but we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to
	defeat those measures or use your PII for improper purposes. We cannot ensure
	the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet, and we
	accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure of such information. You
	acknowledge that you provide your PII at your own risk.</p>

	<h2>Compromise of Personal Information</h2>

	<p>In the event that PII is compromised as a result of a breach of
	security, we will promptly notify those persons whose PII has been compromised
	in accordance with the notification procedures set forth above.</p>
