<p></p><h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1><p></p>
<p>The Media Innovation Group, LLC is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. Accordingly, we are committed to observing applicable industry guidelines, including those established by the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.iab.net/" rel="external" target="_blank">Interactive Advertising Bureau.</a> We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also offering our clients the ability to own and use information regarding their interactions with their customers.</p>

<p>Our services and products are described at <a href="http://www.themig.com/en-us/technology.html" rel="external" target="_blank">http://www.themig.com/en-us/technology.html</a> (“Services”). The next few sections below describe how we collect user information in connection with the operation of our Services for or by our clients, such as through advertisements that may appear on various websites on the Internet. Certain information collected by the Media Innovation Group through the use of cookies used in the Services, as described below, may occur on numerous websites across the Internet.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the website on which it appears, and not to any other website or service. This Privacy Policy also provides information about activities we undertake across Internet websites on behalf of our clients.</p>

<p> <strong>For information on how we collect and use information that is collected directly from you on this website, please see the section entitled "Your Correspondence on this Website."</strong></p>

<p class="underline">We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p>We do not collect the online user's personally identifiable information ("PII") from users online through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients. PII generally refers to information such as an individual's name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.</p>

<p class="underline">Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services</p>

<p>We do collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII") to identify browsers that we have interacted with before. For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a browser that has previously seen an advertisement we launched on behalf of a client. In the context of Non-PII, whenever we refer to 'you' or 'yours,' please remember that we may be referring to a certain browser and not an identifiable person since we generally do not know who is using a browser at any particular time.</p>

<p>Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we offer a range of Services to allow advertisers to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements. You can learn more about these advertising practices by visiting <a href="http://www.iab.net/privacymatters/" rel="external" target="_blank">http://www.iab.net/privacymatters/</a> or the "Learn More" section of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/learn_more.asp" rel="external" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative.</a></p>

<p>We may collect Non-PII regarding your online behavior and usage patterns through advertisements operated by our clients to better customize the type of advertisements you see on various sites. Non-PII consists of aggregated information, demographic information (i.e., the country from which you are connecting to the Internet) and other information such as the type of Internet browser used by an online user, a user's computer's Internet protocol ("IP") address, the type of computer operating system used, the domain name of the websites visited before and after viewing an advertisement, as well as information related to websites and web pages a user is viewing when an advertisement is shown which does not specifically reveal a user's identity.</p>

<p>We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels and related technology. No PII is collected or used in this process. A cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser and computer. A pixel is a line of code which is used by a website or third party ad server to track a user's activity. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a user has visited a particular webpage and to collect additional Non-PII that an advertiser may choose to request through the pixel. We may use cookies and pixels for planning, serving, analyzing and managing online marketing and advertising campaigns on behalf of our clients. Non-PII that is collected through our pixels, cookies and related technology will be retained for up to fourteen (14) months, at which time it will be purged from our system.</p>

<p>Though Non-PII does not personally identify anyone, we are still committed to giving users the opportunity to exercise choice about the Non-PII we collect. See the Section titled, "User Choice-Opting-Out of Receiving Cookies."</p>

<p class="underline">Sensitive Information</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect or utilize sensitive information. Sensitive information may include information such as confidential or medical information, religious beliefs and other similar or related information.</p>

<p></p><h1>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</h1><p></p>

<p>We do not collect PII via our technology and our client's advertisements, and therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on through our Services with non-affiliated third parties.</p>

<p>We may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and information derived from it, to our clients, vendors and partners. This Non-PII may be used to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites and for other purposes as described above. This information does not include any PII that can be used to contact or identify any person individually. Further, we encourage our clients, as applicable, to use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to publish privacy policies that tell you about how the information they are gathering is being used. We urge you to always read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand issues relating to your online privacy.</p>

<p>We may disclose a user's Non-PII to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. In addition, if permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose and provide access to a user's Non-PII to our vendors and contractors who are performing services on our behalf. However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any purpose other than providing services to us.</p>

<p></p><h1>USER CHOICE - OPTING OUT OF RECEIVING COOKIES</h1><p></p>
