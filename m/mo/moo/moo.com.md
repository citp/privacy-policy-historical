### 5\. Our commitment to the privacy of children

Protecting the privacy of the very young is extremely important to MOO. No part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. We never seek to collect or maintain information from those under the age of 13, but if it comes to our attention that we have received information about a child under the age of 13 we’ll immediately delete their information from our records. (Though we’d secretly be quite impressed that a 13 year old needed business cards.)

### 6\. Information Sharing And Disclosure

MOO is committed to protecting your personal information. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except:

**Disclosure for legal reasons**

We reserve the right to communicate your personal information to third parties make a legally compliant request for its disclosure.

**Performance of our operations**

The service is necessary for the performance of our operations: mail delivery, hosting services, protecting us from fraud, and payment of your account.

**Changes in MOO Print Ltd.’s business**

If the assets that MOO Print Ltd use to operate its business are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party. If MOO Print Ltd buys or sells subsidiaries or business units then in such transactions customer information is one of the transferred assets, but would remain subject to the commitments made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy or equivalent.

**Aggregate business analyses**

MOO Print Ltd also provides analyses of our customers in the aggregate (basically, a one big lump of data) to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We do this so that we, along with our business partners, can understand you better, and keep bringing you great services. We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, literal statements made by our customers. At no time, however, will we disclose personal information about specific customers.

Linked websites are not under the control of MOO Print Ltd and we are not responsible for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine their terms and conditions of use.

### 8\. Security And Prevention Against Loss, Misuse Or Alteration Of Information

**Information storage**

This is the slightly technical bit – it’s an explanation of exactly how we make sure all your details are secure. It’s pretty straightforward (if a little bit dull!).

All the information you give to us is stored in the UK only on secure servers that are protected in secure facilities including firewall protection.

MOO Print Ltd has implemented such technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access or improper use. We will continue to enhance security as new technology becomes available.

For transmitting your personal information to us, we use a secure server with a 128-bit SSL certificate that encrypts all of your personal information. This encryption process ensures that the information you give us is protected against unauthorized use.

While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. (But as this extensive policy demonstrates, we’ve done everything humanly possible to make sure nothing bad happens.)

Your MOO Print Ltd account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You can play an important role in keeping your personal information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of your password used on the MOO.COM. We recommend that you change your password from time to time for additional security. Please get in touch with us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.

Access authorization is granted to key MOO Print Ltd staff only. Backups are run to prevent loss of information, and our Internet servers are housed in secure facilities. We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each user’s responsibility:

  * To protect against unauthorized access to your details
  * to ensure against use by anyone else of MOO.COM through the machine that the user uses while they are logged on to MOO.COM
  * to log off or exit from MOO.COM when not using it; and to keep his/her password secret



**Data Retention Period**

We will retain your personal data only as long as is necessary for the purposes to which you consent under the MOO Print Ltd Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy, or as is required by applicable law, and then we will delete it (we absolutely promise.) Credit and Payment Card information.
