# Privacy Policy | Moovly

Moovly and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Moovly” or “we”) respect your preferences concerning the treatment of personal information that we may collect from your use of the Platform. This Privacy Policy informs you about how we collect and use your personal information, and how you can control its use. This Privacy Policy describes the broadest potential use of personal information throughout the Platform that is consistent with the terms of this policy. However, we may make far less use of your personal information.

### Collection of Your Personal Information

On the Platform, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your postal or ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, which is used to create a billing account.

In order to access some Services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your login credentials. As part of creating your credentials, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password, as well as an alternate e-mail address. Some Services may require added security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key.

We may collect information about your interaction with the Platform. For example, we may use website analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser’s width and height. We may also use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Platform. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring web site addresses.

When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Moovly, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Moovly, information collected through one Moovly service may be combined with information obtained through other Moovly services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.

### Use of Your Personal Information

Moovly collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and services. These uses may include (a) providing you with more effective customer service; (b) making the Platform easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; (c) performing research and analysis aimed at improving the Platform; and (d) displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences. We may also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the Service. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Moovly and its affiliates. Personal information collected on Moovly sites and services may be stored and processed in Belgium or any other country in which Moovly or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. Moovly abides by the framework regarding the collection, use, and retention of data, as set forth by the European Union and by Belgian law.

### Sharing of Your Personal Information

Except as described in this Privacy Policy or in our communications to you, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Moovly and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. Some Moovly sites allow you to choose to share your personal information with select Moovly partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers.

Other Moovly sites do not share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes, but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from Moovly on behalf of external business partners about a partner’s particular offering (without transferring your personal information to the third party).

Some Moovly sites and services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such sites or services, both Moovly and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded sites and services.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. However, for credit card processing, our fraud detection vendors may use aggregate data to help improve their service. This helps them more accurately detect fraudulent uses of credit cards.

We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (i) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (ii) protect the rights or property of Moovly or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (iii) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Moovly employees, customers or the public.

### Accessing Your Personal Information

If desired you may access your personal information by contacting us on the coordinates noted below. Upon your request we shall promptly correct any erroneous or omitted data regarding your personal information.

### Communication Preferences

You can stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Moovly sites and services by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. You may also have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional e-mail, telephone calls, and postal mail from particular Moovly sites or services.

### Security of Your Personal Information

Moovly is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.

### Collection and Use of Children’s Personal Information

The Moovly sites and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When a Moovly site does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 18, the site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children’s personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 18 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services. Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use Moovly services, this may include such general audience communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children’s personal information. If we change this Privacy Policy in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children’s personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent’s additional consent. We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.

### Use of Cookies

Moovly web sites use “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our Services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to these sites. When you sign in to a site using your credentials, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.

### The use by Moovly of Google Analytics cookies

We collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns by using [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/) cookies. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information does not identify visitors or collect any personal details. We do not make any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our websites. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any personal information from any source. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to use it for.

To provide website visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google have developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the website itself or to other web analytics services.

### Control of cookies

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Moovly sites and services that depend on cookies.

To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)which includes information on how to manage your settings for the major browser providers.

### Use of Web Beacons

Moovly Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Moovly may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of our sites. We prohibit Web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information. Finally, we may work with other companies that advertise on Moovly sites to place Web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Moovly site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser’s site.

### Controlling Unsolicited E-mail (“Spam”)

Moovly is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or “spam”. Moovly has a strict Anti-Spam Policy. Moovly will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. While Moovly continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using junk e-mail tools and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive.

### Changes to This Privacy Statement

We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Moovly will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Moovly is protecting your information.
