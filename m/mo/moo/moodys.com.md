**LAST UPDATED: May 25, 2012** ****

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect your Personal Data (defined below) on those web sites of Moody’s and its service providers that post or link directly to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”) and through offline means, how we protect such data, and the choices you have concerning our use of such data. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Moody’s may from time to time update this Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post or link to the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Please review the “ _Last Updated_ ” legend at the top of this page to determine when this Privacy Policy was most recently revised. 

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Moody’s”, "we", "us", and "our" means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and their affiliates. A complete list of Moody’s group affiliates can be found on the [www.moodys.com](http://www.moodys.com/) web site. ****

Moody's Corporation and its US subsidiaries adhere to EU/U.S. Safe Harbor principles with respect to covered data transferred from the European Union to the U.S. More information about the Safe Harbor program can be found at _<http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>_.  

You do not have to provide us with any Personal Data to visit the Site. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections or use all features of the Site.

**Types of Data Collected**

We gather Personal Data and Other Data (as described below). ****

**Collection of Personal Data**

Personal data is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, _e.g._ , your name, email address, address, or phone number ("Personal Data"). 

• Moody’s requests Personal Data from you when you register on the Site. The registration process requests that you provide your name, business email address, business address, business phone number, and company affiliation, and agree to the User Agreement presented at the time of registration. 

• Moody’s may collect Personal Data voluntarily provided by you, including in emails to the Site, online forms, order and registration forms, surveys, promotion participation, and through offline means. 

• On some of Moody’s Sites, including _[www.moodys.com](http://www.moodys.com/)_ and [www.moodysanalytics.com](http://www.moodysanalytics.com/), you are able to maintain "portfolios", listing financial instruments in which you have a special interest. Providing this information is always at your option. If you provide such information, you will be required to select a username and a password. To be useful, this information must be stored on the Site, and is accessible to anyone with whom you share your username and password. For this reason, please safeguard your username and password carefully and do not disclose it to any other person. 

• 

We may use third-party payment services (each, a "Payment Service") to collect payments made through the Site.  If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you may be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service providers) and not by Moody’s.  Any Personal Data that you provide through a Payment Service page will be collected by Payment Service and not by Moody’s, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Policy.  Moody’s has no control over, and is not responsible for, Payment Service's use of information collected through the Payment Service Page. 

• 

Moody’s collects offline information through various means, including participation at conferences, individual introductions, and from employers that enroll their employees in our services.  From time to time, we may also acquire from third parties certain lists containing the names and contact information of individuals who may be interested in our products and services. If we acquire such a list for promotional purposes, we seek to obtain appropriate representations from the other party that the listed individuals have opted in to receiving promotional messages from any acquirer of such list. 

**Use of Personal Data Collected**

_We may use Personal Data for the following purposes:_

• Fulfillment of Requests.  Moody’s may use Personal Data about you to deliver products and services, and provide you with information about products and services you’ve ordered. 

• Other Communications.  From time to time, we may use Personal Data about you to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.  If your employer is a Moody’s customer, we may also inform you of such products, programs, services and promotions using Personal Data about you that your employer provided to Moody’s.  If you would prefer that we not send electronic marketing messages to you, please see the " _Your Choices_ " section below.

• Promotions.  We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, "Promotions").  We typically ask you for certain Personal Data when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion.  You should carefully review the rules of each Promotion in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about our use of Personal Data about you.  To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of Personal Data about you conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control. 

• Internal Business Purposes.  We may also use Personal Data about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, editorial and feedback purposes, providing customer support, customizing and improving the content and layout of the Site or our other web sites, completing business transactions, development of marketing and promotion plans and materials, statistical analysis of user behavior, product development, administering individual accounts, and meeting government regulatory requirements such as sales tax collection, audits, etc.

• Administrative Communications.  In addition, Moody’s reserves the right to use Personal Data to send to you important information regarding the Site, your account status, changes to the User Agreement, this Privacy Policy, or any other policies, agreements or transactions relevant to your use of the Site. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.

**Collection** **and Use** **of** **Other Data**

• Monitoring Data. Moody’s and its service providers may collect and/or track other information such as demographic information, domain names, computer type, browser types, screen resolution, and other statistical data involving the use of the Site ("Monitoring Data"). We use Monitoring Data to help us understand who uses the Site and to improve and market it, as well as our other web sites and services. Unless combined with Personal Data, Monitoring Data does not personally identify you or any other user, and we may use it for any purpose. 

• Aggregated Data. Additionally, we may aggregate Personal Data in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code.  Such aggregate information may also be used for any purpose. ****

• Cookies.  To enhance the Internet experience on the Site, Moody's and our service providers may use ‘cookies’ on the Site.  Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping and other purposes.  We use cookies and other technologies to facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of our Site.  If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer. If cookies are disabled, however, all features of the Site may not operate as intended. Information about the procedure you are required to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s web site.  We expect our service providers to honor any decision by you to block or disable cookies in connection with the Site.

• Tools. We and our service providers may also use various common Internet tools such as 'pixel tags,' ‘action tags,’ ‘web beacons,’ ‘.gif tags,’ 'JavaScript' or similar technologies (together, "Tools") in connection with Site pages and email messages in certain formats to among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. Tools allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.  When used in email messages in certain formats, Tools can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened.Moody’s uses cookies and Tool technologies to understand how the Site is used and to customize and enhance the Internet experience of individual users. When you revisit the Site, Moody’s may recognize you by a Tool and customize your experience. For example, once you have completed the registration process, a cookie and/or Tool will be used to avoid having you register again.  We believe cookies and Tool technologies add value to the user experience. 

• IP Addresses. When you visit and interact with the Site, we and our third-party service providers may collect IP Addresses.  Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.  We use IP addresses to understand how the Site is used by our users and to improve the Site.   Where required by applicable law, IP Addresses will be treated as Personal Data.

• Strategic Partners and Co-Branded Sites.  From time to time, we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with Moody’s to provide or promote joint products, services, applications, or features (together, “Jointly Offered Items”).  These special relationships may include co-branded web sites (“co-branded pages”). Any information, including Personal Data, that you provide in connection with one of these Jointly Offered Items, and/or on one of these co-branded pages, will be shared with our third-party partners.  By selecting an application or providing your information on these co-branded pages, or by signing up to receive information about or download a Jointly Offered Item, you also consent to our providing Personal Data about you to those third parties.  You should check these third parties’ web sites for information regarding their privacy practices.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES.  If you do not want Personal Data about you shared with such third parties, please do not provide Personal Data in connection with the Jointly Offered Items and/or co-branded pages. ****
