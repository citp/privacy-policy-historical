        <h1>Privacy</h1>
        <p>
</p><p></p>
<p><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

<p>Moovly and its
subsidiaries and affiliates (“Moovly” or “we”) respect your preferences
concerning the treatment of personal information that we may collect from your
use of the Platform. This Privacy Policy informs you about how we collect and
use your personal information, and how you can control its use. This Privacy
Policy describes the broadest potential use of personal information throughout
the Platform that is consistent with the terms of this policy. However, we may
make far less use of your personal information.</p>

<h3>Collection of Your Personal
Information</h3>

<p>On the Platform, we
ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name,
home or work address, or telephone number. We may also collect demographic
information, such as your postal or ZIP code, age, gender, preferences,
interests and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid
subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your
credit card number and billing address, which is used to create a billing
account. </p>

<p>In order to access
some Services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address and
password, which we refer to as your login credentials. As part of creating your
credentials, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers,
which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your
password, as well as an alternate e-mail address. Some Services may require
added security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional
security key.</p>

<p>We may collect
information about your interaction with the Platform. For example, we may use
website analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from your browser,
including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you
used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser
add-ons, and your browser’s width and height. We may also use technologies,
such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about
the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the
Platform. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your
browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type
and language, access times and referring web site addresses. </p>

<p>When you receive
newsletters or promotional e-mail from Moovly, we may use web beacons
(described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine
whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to
provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information. </p>

<p>In order to offer you
a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Moovly,
information collected through one Moovly service may be combined with
information obtained through other Moovly services. We may also supplement the
information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For
example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a
general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain
services to your geographic area.</p>

<h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Moovly collects and
uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and services.
These uses may include (a) providing you with more effective customer service;
(b) making the Platform easier to use by eliminating the need for you to
repeatedly enter the same information; (c) performing research and analysis
aimed at improving the Platform; and (d) displaying content and advertising
that are customized to your interests and preferences. We may also use your
personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory
service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information
on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Services may send
periodic member letters that are considered part of the Service. We may also
occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of
other products or services available from Moovly and its affiliates. Personal
information collected on Moovly sites and services may be stored and processed
in Belgium or any other country in which Moovly or its affiliates, subsidiaries
or service providers maintain facilities. Moovly abides by the framework
regarding the collection, use, and retention of data, as set forth by the
European Union and by Belgian law.</p>

<h3>Sharing of Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Except as described in
this Privacy Policy or in our communications to you, we will not disclose your
personal information outside of Moovly and its controlled subsidiaries and
affiliates without your consent. Some Moovly sites allow you to choose to share
your personal information with select Moovly partners so that they can contact
you about their products, services or offers. </p>

<p>Other Moovly sites do
not share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes,
but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications
from Moovly on behalf of external business partners about a partner’s
particular offering (without transferring your personal information to the
third party). </p>

<p>Some Moovly sites and
services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If
you register for or use such sites or services, both Moovly and the other
company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded sites
and services. </p>

<p>We occasionally hire
other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the
processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting
websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our
services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal
information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the
confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any
other purpose. However, for credit card processing, our fraud detection vendors
may use aggregate data to help improve their service. This helps them more
accurately detect fraudulent uses of credit cards. </p>

<p>We may access or
disclose information about you, including the content of your communications,
in order to: (i) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal
process; (ii) protect the rights or property of Moovly or our customers,
including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of
the services; or (iii) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure
is necessary to protect the personal safety of Moovly employees, customers or
the public.</p>

<h3>Accessing Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>If desired you may
access your personal information by contacting us on the coordinates noted
below. Upon your request we shall promptly correct any erroneous or omitted
data regarding your personal information.</p>

<h3>Communication Preferences</h3>

<p>You can stop the
delivery of future promotional e-mail from Moovly sites and services by
following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. You may also
have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional
e-mail, telephone calls, and postal mail from particular Moovly sites or services.</p>

<h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Moovly is committed to
protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of
security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information
from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the
personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which
are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential
information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it
through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If
a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it
is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this
information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should
always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your
information from subsequent users.</p>

<h3>Collection and Use of Children’s
Personal Information</h3>

<p>The Moovly sites and
services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any
personal information from children. When a Moovly site does collect age
information, and users identify themselves as under 18, the site will either
block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain
consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children’s
personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 18 to
provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services. Please
note that if you grant consent for your child to use Moovly services, this may
include such general audience communication services as e-mail, instant
messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with,
and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can
change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or
request the deletion of their children’s personal information. If we change
this Privacy Policy in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of
children’s personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the
parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent’s
additional consent. We encourage you to talk with your children about
communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.</p>

<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>

<p>Moovly web sites use
“cookies” to enable you to sign in to our Services and to help personalize your
online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard
disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read
by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be
used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. One of the primary
purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your
computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter
the same information and to display your personalized content and appropriate
advertising on your later visits to these sites. When you sign in to a site
using your credentials, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed
in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move
from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page.
When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use
cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may
be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out.
This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will
only need to type your password the next time you sign in. You have the ability
to accept or decline cookies.</p>


<h3>The use by Moovly of Google Analytics cookies</h3><p>We collect standard
internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns by using
Google Analytics cookies. We do this to find out things such as the number of
visitors to the various parts of the site. This information does not identify
visitors or collect any personal details. We do not make any attempt to find out
the identities of those visiting our websites. We will not associate any data
gathered from this site with any personal information from any source. We will
make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we
intend to use it for.</p>

<p>To provide website
visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics,
Google have developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on
communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that
information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. The
Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being
sent to the website itself or to other web analytics services. </p>

<h3>Control of cookies</h3>

<p>Most Web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline
cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to
sign in or use other interactive features of Moovly sites and services that
depend on cookies.</p>

<p>To find out more about
cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and
delete them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/"><span>www.allaboutcookies.org</span></a> which includes information on how to manage
your settings for the major browser providers.</p>

<h3>Use of Web Beacons</h3>

<p>Moovly Web pages may
contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel
gifs – that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow
us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded
services. We may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our
newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted
upon. Moovly may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us
compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional
campaigns or other operations of our sites. We prohibit Web beacons on our
sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal
information. Finally, we may work with other companies that advertise on Moovly
sites to place Web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop
statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Moovly site results
in a purchase or other action on the advertiser’s site.</p>

<h3>Controlling Unsolicited E-mail
(“Spam”)</h3>

<p>Moovly is concerned
about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or “spam”. Moovly has a strict
Anti-Spam Policy. Moovly will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber
lists to third parties. While Moovly continues to actively review and implement
new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently
available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of
unsolicited e-mail. Using junk e-mail tools and being cautious about the
sharing of your e-mail address while online will help reduce the amount of
unsolicited e-mail you receive.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Statement</h3>

<p>We will occasionally
update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our services and customer
feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the “last
updated” date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to
this statement or in how Moovly will use your personal information, we will
notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to
implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage
you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Moovly is
protecting your information.</p>
