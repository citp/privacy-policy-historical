# About Moog - Privacy Policy | Moog

##  Privacy Policy 

Moog Inc. ("Moog") recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy. This Policy describes the information collected by Moog from visitors of Moog's web sites, located at www.moog.com and www.servovalve.com (each a "Site" and collectively, the "Sites"), and how Moog uses that information.

### Collection of Information

In connection with your use of a Site, Moog may require you to provide certain information, such as your name, mailing and e-mail addresses and telephone and facsimile numbers. Other information collected by Moog may be provided automatically when you access a Site. Software is available that enables you to anonymously visit the Sites. If you use this software, Moog will not be able to recognize you and some of the benefits of using the Sites may be unavailable to you.

### Use of Information

The information collected by Moog will be used to communicate with you, to evaluate the use of the Sites and their content, to improve the products and services of Moog and otherwise in connection with the business of Moog. In addition, each Site enables you to transmit your resume in order to apply for jobs at Moog. Any resume received by Moog through a Site may be forwarded to any Moog location worldwide for employment consideration.

### Other Web Sites

A Site may be linked to other web sites. While this Policy describes privacy issues relating to the Sites, it does not describe the practices of any web site that may be linked to a Site. You should consult the privacy policies of those other web sites before submitting any information to them. Moog is only responsible for information collected by it through a Site.

### Cookies

When you visit a Site, Moog may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser directory of your computer's hard drive. A cookie is a small piece of information that a web site can store on your web browser and later retrieve. A cookie enables a Site to recognize you as a prior user, provides the Site with information regarding your prior use and assists Moog in determining what portions of the Site are most appropriate for you. Your web browser may provide you with the ability to not accept cookies. However, in order to take full advantage of the Sites, Moog recommends that you accept cookies from each Site. Moog does not use cookies to examine other web sites you may have visited before or after leaving a Site.

### Disclosure

Moog does not sell or otherwise disclose your personal information to others, except that Moog may disclose such information when it believes, in good faith, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any law or protect the rights, property or safety of another person. However, Moog may sell or otherwise disclose such information in connection with the sale of its business to a third party.

### Consent

By using a Site, you consent to the collection and use of information by Moog as set forth in this Policy. If Moog decides to change this Policy, which it may do at any time without notice to you, Moog will post those changes on this page. By continuing to use either Site after Moog has posted the changes, you agree to and accept such changes. You should periodically check the Sites for changes to this Policy.

### Additional Information

Moog welcomes your questions, comments and requests for additional information regarding privacy on the Internet in general and the Sites in particular. You can contact Moog by e-mail at webmaster@moog.com or by regular mail at Webmaster, Moog Inc., Jamison Rd., East Aurora, NY, USA 14052
