# Privacy | Moosend

Ensuring that the information you provide through this website remains private is important to us as we seek to build strong and enduring customer relationships, and so, Justdot Ltd. wants you to know the specific information we gather about our customers and how we use that information. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free contact us at [hello@moosend.com](mailto:hello@moosend.com).

### Our Collection and Use of Personal Information

Justdot Ltd. is careful to be very clear when requesting the information that, while personally identifying you (“Personal Information”), is required for the successful operation of this website. Such information includes personal information you provide to create a personal access login for our email marketing products; we use that information to contact you regarding your use of our products. We request financial information used to identity you, verify your purchase of our products and services, and send a bill, as applicable. 

Profile and demographic data we collect may be used to personalize this and display information on this web site and any requested email communications in a way that is more relevant to you. Justdot Ltd. also compiles, in the aggregate only, demographic and product use information, and may, from time to time, chose to make that aggregate information available to the public. Under no circumstances will Justdot Ltd. make any personal information about an individual user available to anyone.

Justdot Ltd. strictly adheres to a permission-based email policy. As our customer, your email address is only used to send information that you have requested. As required for complete use of our email marketing software, we allow you to elect to receive, or to not receive, certain information from Justdot Ltd. Except as mentioned herein, Justdot Ltd. will not send unsolicited email information, commercial offers or advertisements to you. Justdot Ltd. will not sell, rent, or loan our contact lists or our customer’s contact lists (including customer data) to any outside firms, nor will Justdot Ltd. use customer contact lists for our own marketing purposes. All opt-in emails we send in response to your request have an easy, one-click unsubscribe function for recipients. Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled without further communication being sent to requesting users.

### The Security and Protection of Other Intellectual Assets

Justdot Ltd. ensures that all subscriber lists, email content, and reports remain private and confidential. Justdot Ltd. may scan the content of your email campaigns to ensure they comply with our Terms of Use — for example, to protect against defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, obscene, profane, or threatening material that is racially or ethnically offensive. Justdot Ltd. will not sell, rent, loan, or invite external access to a customer’s contact lists. Nor will Justdot Ltd. use our customer’s contact lists for our own purposes.

### Communications from Moosend

###  _Updates and Offers_

After an initial email welcoming new users and verifying their new account and confirming their passwords and usernames, established users may receive occasional information on our company’s products, services, special deals, and recent news and events. Our customers are given the option to not receive these types of communications by using the unsubscribe functionality appearing at the bottom of each email.

  


### _Service Alerts and Announcements_

As required, Justdot Ltd. may email a service-related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily disrupted for any reason, we might send users an email. In general, users may not opt-out of these communications from us; however, their own email filters could block receipt. These mandatory communications are not promotional in nature.

###  _Customer Service_

In accordance with the user’s selection, we regularly respond to users’ service requests and account inquiries via either email or phone.

  


### Website Usage 

At times, we may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our hardware and software infrastructure, and to administer our website. These processes do not link your IP address to any personally identifiable information. We also use tracking information to analyze user visits to different pages on our site. Justdot Ltd. does not track what information individual users read or view. Rather, we track how often each page is visited. This helps us design and operate a website that delivers the information you want.

  


### Safeguarding Your Information

We use the latest 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology in processing electronic credit card transactions to protect your information. We are compliant with major card association security initiatives, including the Visa Cardholder Information Security and Compliance (CISP), MasterCard® (SDP), and Discovery Information Security and Compliance (DISC) standards.

Justdot Ltd accounts require that you log in with a username and password. You must secure your login credentials from unauthorized use by a third party.

Please understand that account passwords are encrypted. We cannot see your password; we can only reset them.

### Security Technology

Justdot Ltd. has deployed a sophisticated security architecture comprising the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. That architecture ensures that information about the identity and preferences of our individual members is never accessible to anyone outside Justdot Ltd. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information.

  


### Policy Modifications

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If Justdot Ltd. does change this privacy statement, we will post notice of the changes on our home page and sent an email to users who have signaled their preference to receive such emails. Those changes will be posted here, so visitors are encouraged to check back periodically. However, regardless of any future changes to this Privacy Policy, be assured that we will not use the personal information you have submitted under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.
