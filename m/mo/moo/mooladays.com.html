<p class="content_block_normal_text">
The purpose of MoolaDays is to offer Internet users an
                effective tool for getting email messages that they are interested in. In addition,
                MoolaDays has developed the web technology to enable
                businesses to interact with consumers in highly personalized
                ways without forfeiting the privacy of the consumer. Privacy is
                a critical element of MoolaDays. Our Privacy Policy is an
                evolving document and as such will be updated periodically. We
                welcome feedback about the guidelines outlined in our policy.</p><br>

<p class="content_block_normal_text">
1. MoolaDays will control all information collected as a result of 
                    your membership in MoolaDays.</p>

<br><h3 class="content_block_headline_1">3rd Party Disclosure</h3>

<p class="content_block_normal_text">
Customer information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred,
or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without the consent of
the customer, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product
or service requested by the customer.</p>

<p class="content_block_normal_text"><br>
2. In our online registration form, we require you to provide
                    us with certain personal information about yourself
                    including full name, address, and email address. We then
                    require that our members complete a short demographic
                    profile. We will process this information to administer your
                    membership and to enable you to take advantage of other
                    member benefits. We will process this membership and
                    demographic information to build a profile of your interests
                    and activities so that we can send you surveys, offers and other 
                    benefits that are most likely to be of interest to you. 
                    As we aggregate this type of information about all of our members, 
                    we do not disclose our members' names, addresses, email addresses, 
                    or other personally identifiable information to any third parties.</p>

<br><h3 class="content_block_headline_1">Private Information Security</h3>

<p class="content_block_normal_text">
For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not stored on
our servers. Our payment gateway provider, PayPal,
keeps this information encrypted and secure on your behalf. 
MoolaDays is not responsible for the security of your private information that you are using on our partner web sites.</p>

<p class="content_block_normal_text"><br>
3. We may ask you for personal information at other times,
                    including, but not limited to, when you enter a sweepstakes,
                    contest or promotion sponsored by MoolaDays and/or
                    when you report a problem with any of our services. Personal
                    information gathered in this way will be used solely for the
                    transaction itself unless otherwise specifically explained
                    at the time the information is collected. MoolaDays
                    may retain and reference aggregate information about member
                    preferences gathered in these ways.</p>

<p class="content_block_normal_text"><br>
4. MoolaDays utilizes 'cookies' for convenience so
                    that members will not have to login to the site each time
                    they visit. A cookie is a piece of text that can be entered
                    into the memory of your computer. In this case, it is used
                    to remember your username and password. Most cookies are
                    'session cookies', meaning that they are automatically
                    deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to
                    decline our cookies, if your browser permits, or to ask your
                    browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can
                    also delete cookie files from your computer at your
                    discretion. Note that if you decline our cookies or ask for
                    notification each time a cookie is being sent, you will need
                    to input your username and password each time you visit the
                    MoolaDays site.</p>

<p class="content_block_normal_text"><br>
5. We use your email address to verify your identity and
                    protect against fraud and to contact you when necessary.</p>

<br><h3 class="content_block_headline_1">Email Usage</h3>

<p class="content_block_normal_text">
                    In addition, the email address you provide, may be used to send you 
                    targeted emails. These Paid Email messages usually contain links 
                    to paid surveys, offers that may include some sort of sale, specials or promotions, etc. 
                    Please note that these messages are sent out on a periodic basis and we will
                    select a certain segment of our member base to contact based
                    on the demographic profile that we are targeting.</p><br>

<p class="content_block_normal_text">
If you decide to <a class="coment" href="http://www.mooladays.com/members/signup">opt-in to our mailing list</a>, you will receive emails that may
include company news, updates, related product or service information, promotions,
etc. However, you may opt-out at any time by:</p><br>

                    </ul>

<p class="content_block_normal_text">
6. If a member elects to use our referral email to refer a
                    friend, we ask them for the friend's email address.
                    MoolaDays will send a one-time invitation to visit the
                    site. We do not store the email address after the
                    invitation is sent. The referred friend may contact us 
                    with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p class="content_block_normal_text"><br>
7. MoolaDays may share non-personal aggregate, or

                    us to - disclose any information about you to law
                    enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole
                    discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>

                    has used appropriate industry standard procedures to
                    safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information,

                    analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our network
