## What Personal Information Does Moon.com Gather?

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Moon.com website. The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at Moon.com. Here are the types of information we gather:

• Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit this website. Our web server automatically collects a limited amount of standard information essential to the operation and evaluation of the Moon.com website. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Moon.com. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. 

• Information You Give Us: When you become a member of Moon.com we collect a more personal set of information at our member signup pages. We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future articles for you, and communicating with you. 

• E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Moon.com if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Preferences setting in Your Profile. 

This information helps us assess our information services and is used only for this purpose. This information is not used to identify individuals who come to the website. None of this information is disclosed to other public bodies or individuals.

## Does Moon.com Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our readers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries Avalon Travel and Perseus Books Group controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

• Third-Party Service Providers: At times, we employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

• Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Moon.com members on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Preferences. 

• Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Avalon Travel, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

• Protection of Moon.com and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Moon.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. 

With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

## What About Cookies? 

We also use “cookies” to collect information. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser, remember your passwords and viewing preferences, and to provide features such personalized greetings and storage of articles in your member pages between visits. Cookies allow us to measure activity on our websites to improve your user experience by making improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. 

We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a contest), we do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Moon.com's features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to save articles to member pages, or use any Moon.com products and services that require you to Sign in.

## How Does Moon.com Use Information?

We use the email information you provide to send you our Moon.com email newsletter. With each newsletter we send you have the option of “opting out” so that you will not receive future issues. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete for signing up or opting out.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.  
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

## Children and Privacy

Moon.com encourages parents and guardians to be fully familiar with the websites visited by their children and the content they are viewing. We will occasionally ask whether users are under the age of 18, or 13, for example when requesting personal information from users, or we may ask for parental consent. However, while we request this information or permission, The Perseus Books Group and our associated websites rely on users to be truthful in responding to these questions.

### Individuals Under 13

No information should be submitted to or posted to or on our websites by users under the age of 13 years without the consent of their parent or guardian. Moon.com does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever unless disclosed during collection. Users under the age of 13 are generally asked not to participate in contests or other promotional opportunities.

### Individuals 13 Through 17

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. If a user or their parent or guardian changes their mind with respect to such use, such user, parent or guardian may stop that use by e-mail request or by calling Avalon Travel at 510.595.3664.
