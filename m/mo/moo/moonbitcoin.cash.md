# Moon Cash | Free bitcoin cash faucet

## The bitcoin cash faucet where YOU decide when to claim!

  


### What is Moon Cash?

Moon Cash is a bitcoin cash faucet with a difference...YOU decide how often to claim! 

Whereas most faucets only allow you to claim once per hour or once per day, we allow you to claim as often or as little as you like*   
The faucet will gradually fill up - quite quickly initially but it will slow down over time - until you make a claim. So the longer you leave it the more you will be able to claim.  
You may prefer to claim a smaller amount every 5 minutes, or visit once per day and claim the large amount that has built up while you were away!  


(* minimum 5 minutes between claims per account/IP address)

### Why can't I make a faucet claim?

You might be having problems making a faucet claim for one of the following reasons... 

#### Advert Blocking

If we detect that you have blocked adverts or they aren't showing up in your web browser then we will prevent you from making a faucet claim. If any of our adverts are not showing then there must be something blocking them on your browser/device. This may be an ad-blocking browser plug-in or extension - if so, please disable your ad-blocking browser plugin/software or add this page to the exception list. 

#### Browser/Device incompatability

This faucet web site is designed to work on the broadest range of web browsers and devices possible. However it may be that your browser/device is not supported and you receive an error message when you try to claim. If so, please try a different browser or device to check that this is the problem before contacting us about it.
