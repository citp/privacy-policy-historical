A "cookie" is a small piece of information that is stored by your Internet browser software on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are commonly used to facilitate secure website connections via a unique user name and password, so that you can buy things in an online store and access services that are in password protected areas of a site. They also may be used to facilitate automatic log-in (you can save your own user name and password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit). Cookies are used to authenticate website users and keep track of the user session. They allow us to better analyze our site's traffic patterns and to provide improved content, throughput, advertisements, products and services. They help us to refine and enhance the visitor registration process and add personalization features to customize the site to your needs. Cookies also help identify information that we may need to better serve you should there be any problems with your use of this site. This kind of information may include the web browser you use, the type of computer, the operating system, the Internet service providers, and other similar information.
