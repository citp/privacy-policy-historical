# MoneyShow.com: Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. The following is the privacy policy of MoneyShow.com and MoneyShow regarding the use of personal information collected on MoneyShow.com and on MoneyShow’s affiliated conference Web sites.

Users are not required to provide any personal information to access some free sections of MoneyShow.com and MoneyShow’s conference Web sites. However, for full access to MoneyShow.com and all of its contents, or to receive one of our newsletters by e-mail, or offers from MoneyShow.com partners, it will be necessary to provide some basic information about yourself such as your name, e-mail address, as well as other personal information. You will then also be asked to create a username and password for future access to MoneyShow.com.

If you purchase something through MoneyShow.com or MoneyShow’s affiliated conference Web sites, you will also be asked to provide credit card and other information. To preserve a secure environment, we use standard 128 bit encryption technology, authentication, and other measures to protect your data (assuming your browser is equipped with this encryption technology).

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect personal information about you. Nevertheless, although we use these techniques to protect your privacy, we do not promise nor should you expect that your personal information or private communications will always remain private in an online environment.

The MoneyShow.com Web site and MoneyShow’s affiliated conference Web sites will collect data automatically using small data files called “cookies” that Web sites transmit and are stored on the user’s hard drive. These files contain anonymous identifiers and are used to track visited Web pages. Cookies allow you to avoid signing in each time you access your account from the same computer and to save customized personal settings. Your Web browser may be set to reject cookies or to ask permission from you before accepting them.

Outside companies’ advertisements may be displayed on our Web site, and these companies may set cookies on your computer. The use of these are subject to each company’s own privacy policy, and not ours.

Anonymous information about our users in aggregate, such as a user’s status as an investor or professional advisor, or other information you may provide as part of the registration process, may be provided to our advertisers and business partners so that appropriate advertisements can be displayed.

Your personal information will not be sold or shared with any company not affiliated with MoneyShow.com or MoneyShow, without your permission, with the following exceptions: 

  * In response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process from law enforcement agencies or to defend against legal claims; 
  * We provide information to investigate or prevent suspected illegal activities. 



With your permission (through our “opt-in” messages on registration or special offers pages of this site) we may send you e-mail messages such as service announcements and other event related messages, as well as our newsletter, and special offers from our partners that you may choose to receive, but you will maintain the right to change your “opt-in” status going forward through online communications and/or other means through this Web site.

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY: If our policy changes, we will post the new policy on the Web site and changes will be made applicable within 24 hours. Please check back often to review the latest changes.

How to contact us about privacy issues: by mail, send correspondence to: Customer Service, MoneyShow.com or MoneyShow, 1258 North Palm Avenue, Sarasota, FL 34236. By e-mail send inquiries to: [content@moneyshow.com](mailto:content@moneyshow.com).
