## 1\. INTRODUCTION.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium Foundation (the "Aquarium," "we," or "us") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our Guests—that is, our in-person and virtual visitors, members and donors. Our policy covers information we collect through the mail, over the phone, in person at the Aquarium or off site at Aquarium events and online through our websites (including through application programming interfaces), e-newsletters, e-books and mobile applications, (collectively, "Services"). We created this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to give you confidence as you visit, join, donate, or use our Services and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. We have designed our privacy policy to be easy to navigate and understand and to provide transparency into our practices and principles.

With respect to our membership and fundraising practices, we adhere to [A Donor Bill of Rights](http://www.afpnet.org/files/ContentDocuments/Donor_Bill_of_Rights.pdf), which requires that we handle all information about our Members and Donors with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law. Members and Donors always have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from any lists that we may intend to share pursuant to this Policy.

## 2\. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES.

We collect personal and anonymous information from our Guests and may use this information to create aggregate information. We may share information as further described in Section 3. The types of information we collect are described as follows ("Collected Information"):

  * **Location Information.**  When Guests access the Services virtually, we have the ability to recognize Guests' domain names, IP addresses (the number assigned to computers and mobile devices on the internet) and general physical location. No personal information about you is revealed in this process. Your IP address is used to help identify your computer and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information about you.
  * **Use, Viewing and Technical Information.**  The Services may also gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, such as which pages you visit, how you are accessing the Services (including the type of device and screen size), how long you use the Services, your preferred language, and the site you visited immediately before arriving at one of our websites. This anonymous information is used for marketing purposes, is shared with business partners and advertisers and is analyzed to help us improve the Services for our visitors.
  * **Cookies.**  From time to time, we may use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications. This allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your use of the Services such as your password being remembered or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We use remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors show our ads on sites across the internet. We, and third-party vendors (including, but not limited to, Google), use first-party cookies (e.g. Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (e.g. DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website to provide you with more relevant ads to your interest. Data about you from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) may also be compiled together to allow us to view information about our audience in order to provide them with information pertinent to them. Although the cookies do not store any Personal Information you can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Setting. We do not set or collect any personally identifiable information through cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms other than cookies. Cookies help us learn which areas of our Services are useful and which areas need improvement. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, keep track of your shopping cart or save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you access the Services. We also track our advertisements' online performance with cookies and tracking codes. Data is collected to determine which pages Guests visit and whether purchases are made after clicking on or being exposed to our advertisements. Tracking codes allow MBA to record the path a Guest takes in navigating between and among various components of the Services. Tracking codes do not automatically store themselves as files on Guests' computers or mobile devices. Cookies do automatically store themselves on Guests' computers and mobile devices, but you can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.
  * **Third-Party Cookies.**  Promotions or advertisements displayed through the Services may also use cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers. You may disable cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
  * **Personal Information.**  In order for you to access certain services and information, make donations and purchases, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may be provided via our virtual Services as well as in person or through the mail and includes the following categories of information: 
    1. Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address and e-mail address), which you may provide when you create an account, supply your e-mail to us at a photobooth or subscribe to our e-mail newsletter. We may use your Contact Data to contact you regarding your purchase, donation or visit to the Aquarium, or your use of our websites or applications. We may also use your Contact Data to send you information or promotional materials about the Aquarium, our partners' products or services and to solicit donations or invite you to become a member of the Aquarium.
    2. Financial Data (such as your bank account or credit card number) which you provide when you make a purchase or donation through our sites or applications. We may use Financial Data you have provided to bill you for products and services you have requested.
    3. Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age and income). We may use your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your experience by displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences.

  * **Comments and Suggestions.**  We welcome your feedback and provide opportunities throughout the Services and at the Aquarium for you to submit comments and ideas, make suggestions, request information and to report problems. Even if you contact us through one of our forms through the Services, we cannot determine your e-mail address unless you include it in your response. We may wish to post your feedback and will do so anonymously, or will identify you by your first name, initials, or display name only, unless you specifically authorize otherwise. Please note that any suggestions or ideas you submit to us will become the property of the Aquarium and can be used by us for any purpose.
  * **Surveys.**  If you choose to participate in one of our surveys, we may ask you for certain Demographic and other Personal Information. We do not share this information with others.

## 8\. SECURITY.

The Services have security measures designed to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we obtain from you. However, you should be careful about the personal information which you provide to us through the Services because we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any loss or expense to you or to any third-party arising out of any breach in our security measures.
