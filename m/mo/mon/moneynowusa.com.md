Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

At MoneyNowUSA.com we promise not to contact you unless you request information. Our goal is to provide the consumer with free information about loans and loan products without pop-ups and Spam. Money Now! USA is operated by Blue Global LLC located at 7652 East Greenway Road Suite 103 Scottsdale, AZ 85260. If you have a question comment or suggestion we can be reached by e-mail at [chris@MoneyNowUSA.com](mailto:chris@moneynowusa.com).

If you apply for a loan on our site, we request certain personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, email address, and phone number. This information is necessary to process your loan application and to match you with the best loan provider. We will then share this information with the loan providers that wish to offer you a loan. Once you have been transferred to that third party the [www.moneynowusa.com](http://www.moneynowusa.com/) privacy statement no longer applies to the information that you entered on the application form. You will then be contacted by that provider directly either via email or telephone. Once you are contacted by that provider if you wish to no longer be contacted by them you must unsubscribe from that provider directly.

Newsletters

You have the option to receive our monthly newsletter when you register. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section. __

Choice/Opt-out

We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you apply for a loan but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference in the checkbox.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving it by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by emailing us at [chris@MoneyNowUSA.com](mailto:chris@moneynowusa.com).

Log Files

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name and e-mail address (where possible). As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes browser types, internet service providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. ****

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

We collect only the domain names, but not the e-mail addresses of visitors to our Web page. We also collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information as to what pages the consumer accesses or visits, and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page and is used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes. It is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

Cookies

With respect to cookies: A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. __

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. For more information, please visit the Department of Energy's website at <http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml>.

We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter them more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site, while providing conversion tracking data for our advertisers and partners.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site. Disclosure: This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by the Money Now! USA Web site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party advertising partners or payday loan lenders. Furthermore, if you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending us an e-mail at the above address or by visiting the Choice/Opt-out section of this policy.

Changes in this Privacy Statement

Occasionally, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page and by email at the email address that you provided.

Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Upon request we provide site visitors with access to contact information (i.e., name, address, and phone number) that we maintain about them. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our services, you may amend or remove your information by emailing us at [chris@MoneyNowUSA.com](mailto:chris@moneynowusa.com), or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed above. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

Security

With respect to security: We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send us an email at [chris@MoneyNowUSA.com](mailto:chris@moneynowusa.com).

When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as contact or financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and will notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our site that we have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from said visitors to our site. Specifically, when you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and/or social security numbers) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Legal Disclaimer

We also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

Links to Other Sites

If you click on a link to apply for a loan (including on an advertisement), in some instances you will leave the Money Now! USA Web site and go to the site that you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Money Now! USA. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to the Money Now! USA Web site, you should also read _that_ site's privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.

Tell-A-Friend ****

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Money Now! USA stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Your friend may contact us at [chris@MoneyNowUSA.com](mailto:chris@moneynowusa.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

Agents/Service Providers

We use Commission Junction who hosts our affiliate program sign up. When you sign up for our affiliate program, the personal information that you enter will be used by Commission Junction as necessary for them to sign you up for [www.moneynowusa.com](http://www.moneynowusa.com/) ‘s affiliate program. The personal information is not shared with [www.moneynowusa.com](http://www.moneynowusa.com/).

Additionally, we partner with third parties to provide users with loan-matching services, credit report services, debt reduction services, and other free financial consultation services on our site. When a consumer requests any of these services, we will share their name, email address, phone number, and specific location, as necessary, to these third parties so that they may provide the requested service(s). 

When a user comes to our site and requests a loan from our service providers, the user's PII is then sent to a limited list of service providers that will be able to assist the user with his/her needs. PII will be sent with the utmost possible speed upon consumer submission of such information. Lightspoke.com will keep a copy of all consumers' PII on its data base for the purposes of record keeping and any necessary provision of assistance to consumers or service providers. Once a consumer's information is received by the service provider, response time is at the complete discretion of the service provider.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above addresses or phone number. You may also contact the DMA's Committee on Ethical Business Practices at mgoldberger@the-dma.org, state or local chapters of the Better Business Bureau, the state or local consumer protection office, or The Federal Trade Commission by phone at 202.FTC-HELP (202.382.4357) or electronically at <http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/complaint.htm>.
