        <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
            privacy policy.
            The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and
            conceivably
            the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers
            to post a
            conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those
            individuals or companies
            with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>

        <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
            Children's Online
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States'
            consumer protection
            agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
            protect children's
            privacy and safety online.</p>
        <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

        <h2>CAN-SPAM Act</h2>
        <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
            messages, gives
            recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for
            violations.
        </p>
        <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has
                occurred.
            </li>
            <li>Authorize and authenticate you as a user of our services and provide additional functionality such as
