**Cookies**

Our Website uses cookies as described below:

A "cookie" is a small piece of information that a website assigns to your device while you are viewing a website. Cookies are very helpful and can be used for various different purposes. These purposes include allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enable automatic activation of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the interaction between you and our services quicker and easier. Cookies are also used to compile statistical data on your use of our services.

Our website uses the following types of cookies:

'session cookies' which are stored only temporarily during a browsing session in order to allow normal use of the system and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed;

'persistent cookies' which are saved on your computer for a fixed period and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Such cookies are read only by our Website and used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits—for example, to allow us to store your preferences for your next sign-in;

'third party cookies' which are set by other online services who run content on the page you are viewing—for example, by third party analytics companies who analyze our web access, or are used to deliver tailored offers and advertisements to you, based on your derived interests.

Cookies usually do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but Personal Information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to the information stored in or obtained from cookies. You may remove the cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences; however, if you choose to disable cookies, some features of our services may not operate properly and your online experience may be limited.

We also use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about your use of our services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users access the Website, what pages they visit when they do so, etc. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Website. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying information.
