Except where section 3.6 may apply, we don't store or use your personal information or use it after you receive your result.

Section 8 below explains what to do if you change your mind and decide you don't want to hear from us anymore about these things we think you'd be interested in.

All personal information that we hold to enable your use of the MSE Personalised Tools can be deleted by you when you use the relevant MSE Personalised Tool.

**3.8.3** award you a prize if you have won a competition we're running. 

If you're providing us with another person's personal information you should first ask them to read this Privacy Policy and our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/site/terms-conditions). By giving us personal information about another person you are confirming that they have given you consent to provide the personal information to us and that they understand how their details will be used.

We will periodically review your personal information to ensure that we do not keep it for longer than is permitted by law (see section 12 below).

  * We will only collect and use your personal information (as described in sections 2 and 3) in accordance with data protection laws. Our grounds for processing your personal information are as follows:

    * **Consent**  – Where necessary we will only collect and process your personal information if you have consented for us to do so. For example, when you register to use Cheap Energy Club, we will use your personal information to provide the services detailed at section 3.4.1.
  

    * **Legitimate Interests  **– We may use and process some of your personal information where we have sensible and legitimate business grounds for doing so. Under European privacy laws there is a concept of  _"legitimate interests"  _as a justification for processing your personal information. Our legitimate interests for processing your personal information are:
      * to enable you to access and use the Site;
      * to communicate with you about your use of the MSE Personalised Tools. For example, sending you a confirmation email of your search results after you have used the MSE Personalised Tools. Unless you have agreed, this won't include communications about consumer news, other MSE Personalised Tools, other MoneySaving tips, products and exclusives which we think you may be interested in; and
      * to improve our Site. We may use your personal information to undertake demographic segmentation and generate profiling information to help us understand what you might be interested in and for market research. We are always working to make a better Site for you and using your personal information in this way helps us to do this.  


From May 2018, you will have a right to object to our use of your personal information for these legitimate interests, including a right to object to profiling by us (see section 8 below).

  * We do not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 16. If you are aged under 16 please get your parent or guardian's permission before you provide any personal information to us.

  * We are part of the MoneySupermarket Group comprising the following brands: MoneySupermarket.com, TravelSupermarket.com and MoneySupermarket Go, and all operate in the UK. MoneySavingExpert.com's specific way of operating is governed by the legally binding [Editorial Code](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/site/editorial-code). This includes that:

**6.1.**  Any personal information about you, including contact details (as opposed to aggregated or anonymised user behaviour data), we gather while operating our Site shall not be tracked or otherwise used by MoneySupermarket Group without your informed consent and the express permission of MoneySavingExpert.com's Executive Chairman (except for internal reporting, accounting or compliance purposes);

**6.2.  **If you give separate informed consent for your personal information to be shared across the MoneySupermarket Group it may then be used to speed up form filling, or to personalise or improve your experience if you then go to those websites;

**6.3.**  If we send you directly to MoneySupermarket Group's websites or you visit them independently, your personal information shall be subject to those websites' privacy policies; and

**6.4.**  Any of your personal information, including contact details, gathered while operating our Site shall not be sold to third parties or used for the purposes of unsolicited communications from other parts of the MoneySupermarket Group.

  * The personal information that we collect when you use our Site is confidential. We may disclose your personal information to a third party in the following circumstances:

**7.1. Our service providers  **– as described in sections 3.5 to 3.7 and 6 above, and for the purposes of providing certain services and enabling your interaction with the Site, such as your use of MSE Personalised Tools. These include:

**7.1.1.**  Experian Ltd (" **Experian** ") – we operate Credit Club in conjunction with UK credit reference agency Experian. By submitting your details to Credit Club, you are consenting to them being passed to Experian and to us letting you know every time your Experian Credit Score or Experian Credit Report has been updated. For further information about how your details will be used, please see the rest of our Privacy Policy and Experian's [terms and conditions](https://termsandconditions.hdd2.co.uk/Policy/);

**7.1.2.**  Capital One Plc (" **Capital One** ") and HD Decisions, an Experian business (" **HD** ") – we operate the eligibility tools in conjunction with Capital One and HD which partners with the following UK credit reference agencies: Callcredit Limited (" **Callcredit** "), Equifax Limited (" **Equifax** ") and Experian from time to time. We will use the personal information you submit to enable your interaction with our eligibility tools. If you use our eligibility tools a credit report will be generated by carrying out a 'soft' credit check. 'Soft' credit checks allow you to get quotes without affecting your creditworthiness. The 'soft' credit checks will be used by Capital One to match against their lending criteria and HD to match against other providers' lending criteria. Capital One and HD's information is then used to let you know your percentage chances of successfully obtaining a credit card or loan. Note that your credit report will not be provided to you directly and we will not receive it either. By submitting your details, you are consenting to Capital One and HD passing them to Callcredit, Equifax and/or Experian. For further information about how your details will be used, please see the rest of our Privacy Policy and Capital One's [terms and conditions](http://www.capitalone.co.uk/creditcards/quotation-ts-and-cs.jsf) and HD's [terms and conditions](https://termsandconditions.hdd2.co.uk/).
