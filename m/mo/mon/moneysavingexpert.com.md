**2.3 Product Application Forms**

We may collect personal information from you when you request certain products via forms on our Site. If we need to pass your information to a third party in order to meet your request, we will make it clear at the time you submit your details. In accordance with clause 6, we recommend that you read the privacy policies of those third parties. Please note we may use the information you submit in accordance with clause 2.5 below.

**2.4 When you interact with our personalised tools**

In order for you to interact with our personalised tools, including Cheap Energy Club, Credit Club, Eligibility tools and any other personalised tools including clubs that we may launch from time to time ("MSE Personalised Tools") we need to collect certain personal information from you. We may use or share your details with our third party partners: (i) for the purpose of enabling your interaction with MSE Personalised Tools (eg, getting your credit information to enable us to give you an eligibility score); and (ii) in accordance with clause 2.5 below. Under no circumstances will those third parties be permitted to use your details for their own marketing purposes. 

**2.4.1 Cheap Energy Club**

We collect your name, home address, email address, energy tariff and energy usage details if you register with Cheap Energy Club.

We will use this information as described above and: 

  * To provide you with energy tariff comparisons (which will involve regular periodic background comparisons using this information against current prevailing energy tariffs currently available on the market for as long as you are signed up to Cheap Energy Club);
  * To alert you to: (i) energy deals which meet your chosen savings trigger; (ii) occasional energy consumer news; and (iii) other MSE clubs which we think you may be interested in;
  * In connection with an application to switch your energy provider (including, where applicable, in connection with cashback due to you under the switch);

**2.4.2 Credit Club**

We collect your name, date of birth, home address, post code, email address and certain details about your personal circumstances if you register with Credit Club. We operate Credit Club in conjunction with Experian Ltd ("Experian"), a UK credit reference agency. We will use the information you submit as described above:

**2.4.3 Eligibility tools**

We collect your name, date of birth, address, post code, email address and certain details about your personal circumstances if you choose to interact with our Eligibility tools. We operate these tools in conjunction with Capital One plc ("Capital One") and HD Decisions – an Experian business ("HD") which partners with the following UK credit reference agencies: Callcredit Limited ("Callcredit"), Equifax Limited ("Equifax") and Experian from time to time. We will use the information you submit as described above and to: 

  * Enable your interaction with the tools. This includes generating a credit report by carrying out a 'soft' credit check. 'Soft' credit checks allow you to get quotes without affecting your credit worthiness. The 'soft' credit checks will be used by Capital One to match against their lending criteria and HD to match against other providers' own lending criteria. We will then use Capital One and HD's information to let you know your percentage chances of successfully obtaining a credit card or loan. Note that your credit report will not be provided to you directly and we will not receive it either; 
  * Alert you to other MSE Personalised Tools which we think you may be interested in; and
  * Communicate with you at your request and enable your details to be moved across our tools (with your informed consent) in order to speed up form filling, or to personalise, or improve your experience on our Site.



By submitting your details, you are consenting to Capital One and HD passing them to Callcredit, Equifax and/or Experian. For further information about how your details will be used please see the rest of our Privacy Policy and [Capital One’s terms and conditions](https://www.capitalone.co.uk/creditcards/quotation-ts-and-cs.jsf) and [HD's terms and conditions](https://termsandconditions.hdd2.co.uk/).

**2.6 Our Group**

### 5\. Cookies

We use cookies (files which are sent by us to your computer or other access device) and tracking technology to help to improve the functionality and performance of our Site and the Forum.

The information derived from our use of cookies will be aggregated to provide statistical information about the usage of our Site. However, we do not use any information derived from cookies, nor any IP addresses we collect, to identify any individual user of our Site. 

Some third-party technology we use (eg, embedded videos, social sharing) also drop cookies to improve your experience on their sites. 

For details on what cookies we do use, information on how to stop them being stored or how to delete ones already stored, read our [Cookies Policy](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/site/cookies-qa).

Our Site contains links to third party websites that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Read our Terms and Conditions of Use for further information on these links. We recommend you read the privacy policy of any websites you visit.

### 7\. Security Policy

Keeping information about you secure is very important to us so we store and process your personal information in accordance with the high standards required under data protection legislation. From time to time and for operational reasons the personal information we collect from you may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Your information may also be processed by some of our service providers who operate outside the EEA. We use these service providers (which may include some based in the USA) to help us provide products and services to you. When we appoint suppliers we take care to ensure that they have appropriate security measures in place. However, different countries have different data protection and security laws and some of these do not offer the same level of protection as you enjoy under UK data protection legislation. You should be aware that your information may be accessible by government and law enforcement agencies.

You may complete a registration process when you sign up to use parts of our Site. This may include the creation of a username, password and/or other identification information. Any such details should be kept confidential by you and should not be disclosed to or shared with anyone. Where you do disclose any of these details, you are solely responsible for all activities undertaken on our Site where they are used. To protect your account, we ask you to choose a strong password to access your data on our Site. A strong password should include a mixture of letters and numbers. Your password can only be reset with access to the email address registered in our system. 

We do our best to keep the information you disclose to us secure. However, we can't guarantee its security. By using our Site you accept the inherent risks of providing information online and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security.
