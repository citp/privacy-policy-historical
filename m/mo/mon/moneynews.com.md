Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience.

This site contains links to other sites. NewsMax.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects your personally identifiable information. 

NewsMax.com gathers user information in the following processes: 

  * **Order forms**
    * Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information and financial information (i.e. credit card numbers). 
    * NewsMax.com has partnered with several affiliates to provide a wide range of products and services to our visitors. These include Booksite.com, USAFlags.com, nexchange.com, GTC.com. Please be aware when you make a purchase from these affiliates you link to their site. However they do collect all the users credit card and billing address for their purchase to be shipped by them. They are the sole collectors of this information, NewsMax does not have access to any personally identifiable information.


  * **Online surveys**
    * Our occasional online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (i.e. email address) and demographic information (i.e. zip codes, age, income level, etc.) to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information with our advertisers and partners. 


  * **Contests**
    * We occasionally run contests and/or sweepstakes on our site in which we may ask visitors for contact information. The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. 


  * **Email alerts**
    * NewsMax.com offers electronic newsletters to users. NewsMax.com gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. You may opt-out of receiving future electronic newsletters by sending an email to the address provided in each mailer. 
    * NewsMax.com delivers newsletters, marketing and product offerings via email to registered recipients from our subscription center. 


  * **Public Forums**
    * NewsMax.com makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information. 


  * **Security**
    * This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 
    * When our registration/order form asks you to enter your sensitive information (credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL. When you are on a secure page, such as our order form, you should notice that the lock icon on the bottom of your browser (Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer) becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.
    * While we use SSL encryption to protect your sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your information off-line.

All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform their job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to your information. Each filing cabinet has a lock, and keys to the cabinets are themselves locked up at night.

Also, our employees must use password protected screen-savers, so that in the event they are away from their desks, no unauthorized personnel have access.

Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.
