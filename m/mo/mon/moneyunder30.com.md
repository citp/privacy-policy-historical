### Terms of Service

Please read the following terms of service before accessing this Website ([moneyunder30.com](https://www.moneyunder30.com/); the “Website”). By accessing or using this Website, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth below. This agreement can be modified at any time, and such modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting of the modified agreement on this Website. Your continued access or use of this Website shall be deemed your conclusive acceptance of the modified agreement.

**Website Contents**

The contents of this Website are provided for informational and entertainment purposes only, and should not be construed as financial or legal advice. Because this Website is intended to provide general information only, you should discuss your specific needs with a qualified professional.

While the information shared on this Website is believed to be accurate and reliable, the owners/operators of this Website specifically disclaim all warranties, express, implied or statutory, regarding the accuracy, timeliness, and/or completeness of the information contained herein.

**Third Parties:  **Because the terms of third-party offers referenced on this Website are subject to change without notice, visitors are encouraged to independently verify the terms of any such offers prior to participating in them.

**Comments:  **Individuals leaving comments on this site are solely responsible and liable for the contents of their comments.

### Disclosures

We want this site to be an independent source of financial information you can trust. Period.

_Money Under 30_  offers advertisers the opportunity to sponsor articles, in which case the sponsored article is clearly labeled “sponsored” and additional disclosures will be contained in the body of the article.

Also, per U.S. laws and regulations, if a writer blogs about a stock that he or she owns, we’ll disclose that fact at the end of the article. Also, if we receive a free product (such as a book) and write about it, we’ll disclose that fact in the article or at the end of the article.

**Affiliate Links**

We’re able to produce our little Website here _and_ keep food on our tables thanks to advertisers. Some of these ads you see as banners across the top and sides of the site. Others are what’s known as **affiliates**. This means they pay us if somebody reads about the product here and later tries their service or buys their product. We may link to these advertisers within some posts that serve as reviews or comparisons of certain products or services.

Three things:

  * We go to great lengths to vet every affiliate we recommend. If it’s not something we would use ourselves, we won’t link to it.
  * If there is a better product or service out there that doesn’t have an affiliate program, we’ll still tell you that it’s better.
  * We make every effort to disclose affiliate links and relationships either in the context of the article or at the end of the article copy.



It’s our philosophy that you, our readers, are intelligent humans capable of making informed decisions about financial products and services, and we  hope our content can aide in those decisions. Therefore, we try the best we can **not** to allow an affiliate relationship to influence our content. We do not, for example, promote affiliate advertisers if we would not personally use their products or services ourselves. That said, we totally realize that in some cases this type of relationship may create the appearance of a conflict of interest. As such, please let us know if you feel we are working with an advertiser that does not belong or if any content has been unduly influenced by an affiliate relationship.

**Archived Content:  **Money Under 30 has grown bigger than we ever expected it to (lucky us)! That means there are archived posts and pages that may not fully adhere top this policy. We are working on it, but if you come across a page that you believe should have a disclosure and does not, please [contact me](https://www.moneyunder30.com/contact-me).
