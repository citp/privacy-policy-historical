A toolbar installed on an Internet Explorer browser can be minimized by right clicking the toolbar and selecting it. In addition, the toolbar may include the Montiera Search Assistance feature, which provides you with relevant search results when you place a search query in the browser address bar (as described above under Search Assistance). When a user uses one of Montiera search feature to search the Web, the query reaches the publisher servers. As all standard Web pages, besides the keyword query, it includes information such as IP address, default language setting, browser type, and an anonymous unique ID. Montiera uses this information in order to appropriately process your search request and to serve you relevant and better search results.
