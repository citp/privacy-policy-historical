We do not share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. For California residents, please see "Your California Privacy Rights" below.

We may share personally identifiable information among Mondelēz Global brands, affiliates and subsidiaries. In the course of doing business, we employ other companies and individuals to perform a variety of functions on our behalf. For example, we hire agencies to help administer consumer promotions, to analyze data, to fulfill orders you place, and to provide customer service. These service providers may have access to personally identifiable information about our website visitors if it is needed to perform their functions for Mondelēz Global, but they are not authorized by Mondelēz Global to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on Mondelēz Global's behalf or to comply with legal requirements, and they are required to maintain the information in confidence. In addition, we may disclose information where we think it's necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others, if required by law, or in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials.

We may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain personally-identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you consent to such sharing.

During the normal course of our business, Mondelēz Global may sell or purchase assets or equity. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personally identifiable information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement.

### How We Protect Your Information

Protecting your personal information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the personally identifiable information we collect on our sites.

### Your California Privacy Rights

For California Residents Only. We may share your personally-identifiable information with affiliated third parties, some of which do not share the Mondelēz Global name, for their own direct marketing purposes. If you would like to learn more about the types of personal information we share with these affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, or their identities, please send a letter with your name, postal address, and e-mail, with the heading "California Privacy Rights" to:

### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Our sites are intended for general audiences and Mondelēz Global does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 on our sites. We might permit a child to send us an e-mail. We will respond to or deliver these e-mails, but we do not store the names, e-mail addresses, or the e-mails themselves in our operational database. We do not maintain this information, nor do we share it with third parties (other than support service companies as described above).

Under federal law, websites directed to children under 13 are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to engage in the activity. We comply fully with this requirement.

Upon proper identification, any parent can review any personal information we have collected from their child, if we are still maintaining the information in our operational database. They may also request that the information be deleted from our database, and refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Online Team as described below.
