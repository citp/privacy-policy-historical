<p>6.5 You have control and responsibility over the privacy settings on your account. 3 privacy settings are available: public (anyone can view post), friends only (only “friends” can view post) or private (only the member who submitted the post can view post). These privacy settings can be applied to your action plan progress, your journals, your photos, who can send you private messages and who can view activity within your profile. However, if you respond to a post made by another user, the privacy setting of your post will default to the privacy setting of the post you are responding to.
