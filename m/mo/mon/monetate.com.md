**About Cookies**

A ‘cookie’ is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. Most major websites such as Google and Amazon.com use cookies to improve the quality of their service and to better understand how people interact with them. The use of cookies on this Website allows visitors to enjoy more seamless visits and enables us to more accurately measure visitor behavior on the Website. 

There are several types of cookies: session cookies, persistent cookies, and Flash cookies. Session cookies exist only during an Internet user’s online session. They disappear from the user’s computer when he/she closes the browser software. Persistent cookies remain on the user’s computer after the browser has been closed. Flash cookies are a type of persistent cookie discussed later in this document. 

The cookies used on the Website do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by requesting more information on our product. Otherwise you remain anonymous.

**How We Use Cookies**

When you come to our Website, our web server uses cookies to improve your interaction with the Website by, for example, remembering your preferences. More specifically, Monetate uses cookies to measure your behavior on this Website and to save personal settings on specific pages. For our corporate customers who login to Monetate products through the Website, cookies can also be used to save the username and password so that Monetate can process the saved login information and quickly log that user into the product. Cookies also help us make sure you are who you say you are after you’ve logged in. Monetate uses cookies (that only Monetate can read and use) to identify the fact that you are a Monetate customer or a prior Website visitor (whatever the case may be). Users who disable their Web browser’s ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse the Website; however, they may lose some of the functionality provided by the use of cookies.

**Controlling Our Use of Cookies**

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Monetate websites and services that depend on cookies. We use cookies to collect non-personal information; for example to learn about the behavior of visitors to our web site and how they respond to our marketing communications. The more we learn, the better we are able to provide relevant and interesting content and services. 

We may set cookies through your browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Firefox, or by using Flash Cookies, also known as Flash Shared Objects or local shared objects. A local shared object is exactly like a browser cookie, except that it can also store data more complex than simple text. Shared objects, by themselves, cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. More importantly, shared objects cannot access or remember your email address or other personal information unless you willingly provide such information. Responsible websites use this feature to provide a better user experience; however, you can use Adobe Flash Player security settings to control the degree to which local shared objects work. 

**Security**

Our Website has physical, administrative and technical measures in place to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the data under our control, and to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of such data. While we strive to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us. You send any information via this Website at your own risk.

**Third party sites**

The Website contains links to other websites. Monetate is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. Customers and/or visitors should check the privacy policy statements of these other websites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential.

**Opt-out and update policies**

If, at any time after registering for information or ordering Monetate’s services (“Services”), you change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request specifying your new choice. 

We provide all visitors to the Website options for reviewing, changing, and modifying personally identifiable information previously provided. To update your organization’s profile, user profiles, billing information or to discontinue the Service, email privacy@monetate.com. Users can expect to receive a response to any such update request within fourteen (14) days of Monetate’s receipt of the same.

We and our Subsidiaries will provide you with a copy of any personal information that you have provided in connection with your visit to this Website should you request it, but will require evidence of your identity. We and our Subsidiaries may require a nominal administration fee to cover our costs in providing such information. If you wish to access the personal information we have about you, or to correct factual errors in our records, please contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.
