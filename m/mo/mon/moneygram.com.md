# MoneyGram Corporate - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy: Nonpublic Personal Information Collected in the United States**

All financial institutions are required by law to have in place policies regarding the collection and disclosure of information considered to be "nonpublic personal information." MoneyGram International is considered a financial institution under this law.

We obtain nonpublic personal information about our consumers from information that consumers provide on transaction forms and applications. This information is necessary to facilitate the consumer's transactions. We do not collect nonpublic personal information about our consumers from any other sources.

We may disclose some or all of the nonpublic personal information described above to independent contractors and service providers for the purposes of processing requested transactions or to perform marketing and similar services on our behalf with respect to our own products and services. Our agreements with these service providers contain confidentiality provisions and restrictions on using this information for any other purposes. We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our consumers to anyone for the purpose of marketing or soliciting products or services other than our own.

Access to non-public personal information about our consumers or our consumers' transaction history is restricted to employees, independent contractors, or service providers who need to have access to that information to process our consumers' transactions. We may also disclose certain information as required or permitted under applicable law, for example, to government agencies. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard our consumers' nonpublic personal information.

_Note:_ Effective February 22, 2007. The practices and policies contained in this disclosure are applicable to MoneyGram International, MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc. and FSMC, Inc. They are subject to change, but we will communicate any material changes as required by applicable law.
