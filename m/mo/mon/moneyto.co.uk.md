### Your rights

You have the right to:

  * Request information about whether we hold personal information about you, and, if so, what that information is and why we are holding/using it.
  * Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  * Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
  * Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
  * Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
  * Object to automated decision-making including profiling, that is not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using your personal information or profiling of you.
  * Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
  * Request transfer of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.
  * Withdraw consent. In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.



If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us on email at [info@moneyto.co.uk](mailto:info@moneyto.co.uk) or by post at 91-95 Newington butts, London, United Kingdom, SE1 6SF.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). We will also comply with any reasonable request within 30 days However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

Should you be dissatisfied with our response to your data subject access request, or any actions or processes we have conducted in terms of your personal data, you have the right to complain to the [Information Commissioners Office (ICO)](https://ico.org.uk/concerns/) at ico.org.uk.

However in the first instance you should report your concerns to us. A helpful format for such a complaint can also be found on the ICO website at ico.org.uk.
