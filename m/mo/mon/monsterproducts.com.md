### **MONSTER, INC.**

**Web Site Privacy Statement**

Effective Date: October 29, 2013

Monster, Inc. and its corporate affiliates ("Monster" or "we") provide this Website Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to respect your privacy. This Website Privacy Statement explains how we collect certain personal information at our website at [www.monsterproducts.com](http://www.monsterproducts.com/) and any permutations thereof that directly link to this Website Privacy Statement. This Website Privacy Statement also explains how we use and disclose such information - it does not, however, apply to our use of data that we collect otherwise (e.g., offline or through web sites of our foreign subsidiaries). If you do not agree with this Website Privacy Statement, please do not access or use our website.

**Personal and Non-Personal Information**

Generally, you can visit Monster on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. We collect no such information about you when you visit our Web Site unless you choose to provide that information to us. Monster may request or collect certain personally identifiable information, i.e., information by which you can be identified, such as your name (first and last), address (city, state, zip), e-mail address, telephone number, etc. ("Personal Information") in certain circumstances, as described in this Web Site Privacy Statement and in specific privacy notices (described at the end of this Web Site Privacy Statement under the header "Situations in Which you Submit Personal Information").

**Log Files and Aggregate Information**

Like most website operators, we collect and use IP addresses from browsing machines to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Monster does not link this information with Personal Information about individual users. We may share with potential partners our aggregated demographic information and aggregated information about the transactions conducted on our website. Information we share for these purposes is generally not linked to any Personal Information that can identify any individual person or company.

**Use of Cookies and Web Beacons**

Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our sites will not function properly when you view them.

Third parties employ a software technology called Web beacons or clear, that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Third parties tie the information gathered by Web beacons to our customers' Personal Information.

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and Web beacons to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to track usage and volume statistics to improve our Web Site. We have limited access or control of these third parties that we engage and their tracking technologies.

**Social Media (Features) and Widgets.**

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.

Please be aware that Monster is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites, and this Website Privacy Statement does not apply to such sites.
