				<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT/YOUR AGREEMENT</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Company websites are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18 or those who are not legal
				residents of the United States. By using our website or submitting information to us, you consent to the
				Company's use and sharing of the information collected or submitted as described in this Privacy Policy. If
				you are not 18 years of age or older and a valid resident of the United States or you do not agree with the terms

				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Beginning January 1, 2005 under California's "Shine the Light" law, California residents who provide personal
				information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to either: (1)
				a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided;
				or (2) to be notified of a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with third
				parties. We have elected the second option. To opt-out of having your information shared with third parties,
				<a href="http://www.money4nowusa.com/unsubscribe.aspx">click here</a> and follow the opt-out instructions.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>HOW DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION AND WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We collect and combine personally identifiable information ("PII") and non-personally identifiable information
				("Non-PII") through various sources, including those discussed below. For your reference, PII is data collected with
				an intention to specifically identify, contact or locate a person, including but not limited to name, address, telephone
				number, or e-mail address. Conversely, Non-PII is data that is not used to specifically identify, contact or locate an
				individual, including but not limited to zip code, gender, age, or IP address.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Website Registration Forms</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We collect information about you when you register on one of our websites. This registration information may include,
				but is not limited to your:
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				* e-mail address
				<br>
				* full name
				<br>
				* mailing address
				<br>
				* telephone number
				<br>
				* date of birth
				<br>
				* gender
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Publisher Partners</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				When you complete a registration or offer form that is hosted by one of our website publisher partners on our behalf,
				the website publisher partner may submit all or a portion of the information that you submitted on the form to the Company.
				This information may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number,
				date of birth, gender, and payment information; information about your background, interests, health, education, career goals,
				and shopping preferences; and any other information you provide to our website publisher partner.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Marketing Partners</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may receive information about you, including but not limited to your IP address, e-mail address, first name, last name,
				mailing address, and telephone number, from third party marketing partners that provide us with consumer data to manage on
				their behalf.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Automatic Information/Digital Identifiers</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may automatically receive and store certain types of information about you through the data sources listed above.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				You may be familiar with the term "cookies," which are unique alphanumeric identifiers that store information on your
				computer. A cookie is placed on your computer when your web browser accesses our website. We use cookies for tracking
				transactions and the user characteristics explained in detail throughout this Privacy Policy. If you choose, there are
				utilities available for purchase from independent software providers to install on your computer as well as tools/preferences
				you can choose through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. Of course, cookies let you have a more satisfying
				website experience, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We also collect information through our web server applications. This information includes your Internet Protocol or "IP"
				address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of transactions with us or our advertisers,
				the source information for those transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Government Forms</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				The Company may be required to create, collect, maintain, and submit certain information required by
				the government, such as IRS Forms W-9 and 1099. This information, which may include your taxpayer identification
				number, will not be used, shared, transferred, or sold for marketing purposes.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may use the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including but
				not limited to those explained below.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Pre-select/Pre-fill Offers</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Our website technology may pre-select certain offers for you to view based on the demographic and geographic information
				you submitted to the Company during the website registration process. Additionally, this technology may pre-fill some or
				all of the offers' data fields with the information you submitted during the website registration process in order to prevent
				you from having to re-enter this information. We may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Customer Service and Fulfillment</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may use your information to operate the website promotion, service your account and to fulfill rewards earned through
				Company websites. We may also use your information to verify your identity or claimed account status and, where we consider
				appropriate, investigate your compliance with the terms and conditions of the website promotion or any advertiser offer. We
				do retain customer service correspondence.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Marketing</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may use your information in our online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging,
				skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs. If you would like to be removed from these programs,
				<a href="http://www.money4nowusa.com/unsubscribe.aspx">click here</a> and follow
				the opt-out instructions.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may share the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including but not limited
				to those explained below.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Within the Company</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may share information we collect with affiliated companies, including our parent company and other subsidiaries of our parent
				company, for use in their ad serving and marketing programs. This Privacy Policy does not apply to affiliated companies and their
				collection, use and sharing of information.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Vendors</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may share your information with various third party vendors that are not part of the Company, including but not limited
				to vendors that provide us with technology to deploy commercial e-mail, vendors that sell the products or services for which
				you have qualified through one of our websites, and shipping companies that we utilize to ship products to you.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Advertisers</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				When you participate in an offer by completing a form, we will transfer the information you submitted on the form to the
				applicable advertiser either with our own technology or a 3rd party proxy.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				When you answer "yes" or "no" to a survey question, some or all of the information that you submitted during the website
				registration process will be transferred to advertisers that we believe may be of interest to you without providing you with
				another opportunity to review the information.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				When you select "yes" next to an offer, we will transfer some or all of the information that you submitted during the
				website registration process to the applicable advertiser without providing you with another opportunity to review the
				information either with our own technology or a 3rd party proxy.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Ad Serving Companies</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may use third party ad networks or ad serving companies to serve advertisements on our websites. We pass information
				about you to these companies so that they can deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of interest to you.
				The information passed to these companies may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing
				address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, and any other information you provide to us. Web pages that are served by
				these companies will state that they are "powered by" or "ads by" the applicable company and will contain a link to that
				company's privacy policy.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Marketing Partners
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We may share, license or sell your information to third parties for various marketing purposes, including their online
				(e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing
				programs. If you would like to be removed from these programs, <a href="http://www.money4nowusa.com/unsubscribe.aspx">click here</a>
				and follow the opt-out instructions.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Data Enhancement/Appending/Validation

				<br>
				
				
				We may use third party service providers to enhance our database with additional elements, including but not limited
				to age ranges present in your household, whether you own or rent a home, the length of time you have lived at your residence,
				whether you are a mail order buyer or responder, household income, and gender. Further, we may use third party service providers
				to append telephone numbers to other data points we have in our database. We also may use third party service providers to validate
				the data we have in our database.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Additionally, we may share, license or sell your information to third parties for use in their data validation, enhancement,
				information verification services, and, to the extent permitted by law, individual reference or look-up services.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Governmental Agencies or Other Companies</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may share your information with law enforcement officials or governmental agencies: (1) in response to their
				request; (2) when permitted or required by law; or (3) to establish our compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations,
				or guidelines.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may store and share your information with third parties for suppression or opt-out purposes.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We also may share your information with third parties when: (1) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential
				fraud or unauthorized transactions; (2) investigating fraud that has already taken place; (3) enforcing or applying existing
				terms and conditions and/or other agreements; (4) protecting the rights, property or safety of our websites, our users or
				others; or (5) responding to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend
				against legal claims.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				In all cases, this information is not provided to these entities or persons for marketing purposes.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Right to Transfer</strong>
				<br>

				be transferred as part of that transaction. The Company may decide to retain a copy of the information post sale or transfer.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>COMPANY CUSTOMER CHOICES</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Marketing Communications</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				By completing and submitting a Company registration form, you are consenting to receive marketing communications
				from the Company and its third party marketing partners. If, after you have shared your information with the Company,
				you decide that you do not want to receive marketing communications from the Company and its third party marketing partners,
				you can discontinue the communications by clicking here and following the opt-out instructions. If you have registered or
				submitted information under more than one e-mail account, you must submit separate unsubscribe requests for each account.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF I HIT A LINK TO ANOTHER SITE FROM A COMPANY WEBSITE?</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Our websites may offer links to other websites. Other websites have their own terms of use and privacy and
				security policies. If you choose to visit one of these sites, you should review the policies that govern that
				particular site.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to the Company. Other affiliated entities
				of the Company may obtain information independently from transactions and experiences with you or from other sources.
				This Privacy Policy does not pertain to that information.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>WHAT IS THE POLICY WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN?</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We recognize the unique privacy concerns regarding children. We are committed to carefully protecting
				privacy where children are involved no matter the point of contact. In particular, our intention is to fully
				comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Per COPPA guidelines, we do not knowingly collect
				PII from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian is made aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided
				us with PII through any point of contact, please contact us and we will delete the information about the child referenced
				from our files.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>SECURITY</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				There is no such thing as complete security on the Internet or otherwise. The Company uses various security techniques
				on our websites to help protect against the loss, misuse or modification of information we've collected from you. When
				you access your personal information or transmit information to us, that information is stored on servers that we have
				taken steps to protect from unauthorized access or intrusion. While we strive to protect your information, the Company
				cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when
				communicating with the Company, its partners and affiliates.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OVER PRIVACY IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY,
				AS WELL AS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS WEBSITE (INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES). YOU AGREE THAT THE COMPANY'S
				LIABILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR SERVICES PROVIDED
				TO YOU BY THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT SUCH CLAIM IS NOT OTHERWISE BARRED BY OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</strong>

	*The operator of this site is not a direct lender. Not all of our lending partners loan more than $1,500 at any one time. Currently for
	non-military members a very limited amount of loans are funded for $5,000.00. Depending on your state, credit rating and other underwriting
	factors you may or may not qualify for a premium loan. We will seek out lenders as high as $5,000 with our built in loan application. Some
	borrowers may need to apply more than one time to achieve their desired loan amount.
