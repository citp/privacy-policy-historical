The information we collect in connection with an online forum or community is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to a legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

Employees of Money-Zine.com who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.  For example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Money-Zine.com.

### Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors

Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

Money-Zine.com uses only reputable third party agencies to present or serve advertisements.  Our privacy policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you.

### Cookies

To enhance your experience with Money-Zine.com, many of our web pages use "cookies," which are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information.

Money-zine.com uses third-party advertisements to help support the website.  Advertisers (such as Google's Adsense program) may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise. This can send to these advertisers information including your IP address, ISP, the browser you're using, and in some cases whether you have Flash installed.  This information is generally used for geotargeting purposes.  For example, showing New York insurance advertisements to someone located in New York.  They can also be used to show certain ads based on the pattern of websites you may have visited in the past.

When this website is publishing advertisements from Google, those advertisements may use the DoubleClick DART cookie.  The DART cookie enables Google to serve ads based on user visits to Money-zine.com as well as other websites participating in Google's advertising program.  Users may opt out of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and [content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/).

Money-Zine.com uses cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), or save your password in password-protected areas.

### Commitment to Security

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.
