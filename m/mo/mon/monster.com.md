## Information We Collect and Retain

We collect the [personal](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fullstatement.aspx#2) and [demographic](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fullstatement.aspx#3) information you choose to provide us. We also collect information about how you use our sites and the areas of our site that you visit.

We also use [cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fullstatement.aspx#4) and [web beacons](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fullstatement.aspx#5).

## How Information is Used

Information you post in public areas of the site or placed in the searchable Resume database will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world. We strive to provide a safe, secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that unauthorized parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorized users store or transfer information downloaded from the database, so you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information to Monster.

We use the information you provide us to deliver the products and services we offer, and to operate and improve our sites. Our services may include the display of personalized content and advertising. We may use your information to contact you about Monster site updates, conduct surveys, or informational and service-related communications, including important security updates.

## Disclosure of Information to Others

We share your information with third parties who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These third parties may not use that information for any purpose other than assisting us in providing those products and services. 

If you have consented for us to do so, we may use your information to contact you about other products or services available from our affiliates. 

If you have consented for us to do so, we may also share your information with third parties who may contact you about their products or services. 

We also share information where legally required. Information collected on our Sites is stored in whole or in part in the United States, and may be subject to U.S. law. 

We may disclose and transfer information if our business is sold or acquired.
