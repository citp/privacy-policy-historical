<p>Welcome to Montage Talent. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We have adopted this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to memorialize our data collection and disclosure practices for our website and service offerings (the "Services"). Montage voluntarily complies with the European Union – United States Safe Harbor Principles, and we invite you to review our Safe Harbor Privacy Statement below.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong><br>By using the Services, you consent to this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, we ask that you refrain from use of the Services. Information gathered through the Services may be transferred, used, and stored in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions in which we, our agents, customers, and other users of the Services are located. If you access the Services, you consent to the transfer, use, and storage of your information in those jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Information</strong><br>We collect personally identifiable information in connection with the Services. The types of personal information collected may include your name, user name, address, email address, phone number, social security number, driver license number, IP address, use and browser information, work history, knowledge, skills, abilities, resume data, and answers to employment related questions as examples. We may also collect non-personal and anonymous information to be used in an aggregate fashion. For example, we may collect your system-related information to be used for system administration purposes, to help diagnose problems, to monitor traffic patterns, to determine which services are used most frequently and to assess site usage. We may retain information we gather about you indefinitely unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
<p>The Services may contain links to third party sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices, or content of sites owned by others that you may link to or that may be linked from the Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms and conditions of those sites so that you understand how those sites collect, use, and share your information. This Policy applies solely to the information that we collect from our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies; Beacons</strong><br>From time to time, we may also use "cookies", "web beacons" or similar technology for the convenience of our users and to enhance your experience using the Services. A cookie is a small text file that is recorded either temporarily or persistently on your hard drive by a web page server and is not used to deliver viruses or other harmful programs to your computer. Rather, cookies enable us to recognize a user without requiring the user to repeatedly log in when using the Services. Web beacons are graphics designed to collect web log information such as pages viewed or messages opened. By relying on cookies, web beacons, and similar technology, we may be able to deliver a more efficient service that is more personalized for each user. Additionally, these technologies may allow us to monitor traffic patterns, Services usage, and session information to make the Services more useful.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information </strong><br>We use the information we collect about you to provide services to employers, employees, candidates, and users of our Services. We also use information that we collect to assist us in setting up accounts, improving online operations, and managing our systems. Examples of such use include without limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up accounts.</li>
<li>Record keeping.</li>
<li>Improving our products and services.</li>
<li>Sending promotional messages, special offers or other information that we think you may find helpful.</li>
<li>From time to time, contacting you for market research purposes. We may contact you by email, phone, fax or mail. We may use the information to customize the Services according to your interests.</li>
<li>Providing services to other users of the Services in accordance with the general purposes of the Services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong><br>We may disclose personal information and aggregate anonymous information to other users of the Services (for example, to employers if you are a candidate) and to companies, agents, contractors, or others engaged to perform functions on our behalf. We may also disclose personal information and aggregate anonymous information to those businesses, divisions, and units that are affiliated with Montage. If one of our business lines or the entire business, or a substantial portion thereof, is acquired or transferred, whether by merger, consolidation or purchase of a substantial portion of assets, we may disclose and transfer your personally identifiable information to the acquiring third party. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties when we believe, in good faith and in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the Services; (b) comply with legal or regulatory requirements; (c) protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or other third parties; or (d) prevent a crime or protect national security. We may also disclose aggregate anonymous information to our clients, business partners, merchants, advertisers, investors, potential buyers and other third parties if we deem such disclosure, in our discretion, to have sound business reasons or justification.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong><br>By using the Services, you consent to this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, we ask that you refrain from use of the Services. Information gathered through the Services may be transferred, used, and stored in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions in which we, our agents, customers, and other users of the Services are located. If you access the Services, you consent to the transfer, use, and storage of your information in those jurisdictions.</p>
<p>When you access the Services through any co-branded websites or linked web pages, your personal information may be disclosed to and become the property of us and / or the relevant co-sponsor. In that case, the use of your personally identifiable information by the co-sponsor company will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for nor subject to the co-sponsor's policy regarding their use of your personal information. Accordingly, we encourage you to review the privacy policies and practices of any relevant co-sponsor before supplying any personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Children </strong><br>We do not knowingly or specifically collect personal information from users under 13 years of age. We do not authorize users under 13 years of age to use the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Changes</strong><br>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. In particular, we may modify this Policy to reflect changes in the way we collect, use, or disclose information, or to reflect changes in privacy laws, regulations, and/or industry standards. We encourage you to review this Policy when accessing the Services. Continued use of the Services following changes indicates your acceptance of the changes.</p>
<p><strong>Applicable Law</strong><br>This Policy shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin, USA, without regard to conflicts of law principles, and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any dispute arising out of this Policy shall be the state courts or federal courts located in Wisconsin unless an alternate venue is provided for under the Safe Harbor Principles to which we have agreed with respect to matters covered by the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
