To meet our legal obligations. We use it to:

  * Search your record at immigration and fraud prevention agencies.
  * Prevent illegal activities like money laundering, tax evasion and fraud.
  * Make responsible lending decisions, like offering you an overdraft. We make our decisions automatically using technology. We’ll tell you in the app once we’ve made this decision. You can opt out or ask for a manual review by email and via the app.



To exercise what’s known as our legitimate interests. This is when we use data for a reason which is in your and/or our interest, and which doesn't involve overriding your privacy rights. We use it to:

  * Market products and services generally in app.
  * Search your record at credit reference agencies when you sign up (this is a 'soft search' and shouldn't impact your credit score).



With your permission. We use it to:

  * Check your credit history if you apply for a credit product like an overdraft (this is a 'hard search', it might impact your credit score and chances of getting credit elsewhere).
  * Market and communicate our products and services and those of affiliated partners where we think these will be of interest to you by email. You can always unsubscribe from receiving these if you want to, by email and via the app.



We may share your personal information with:

  * Anyone who works for us when they need it to do their job.
  * Any organisation which supports any of our services you use, when they need it to offer those services. That includes: 
    * Card producers and networks.
    * Credit reference agencies (for information on how they use data please read the [Credit Reference Agency Information Notice](https://www.callcredit.co.uk/crain)).
    * Analytical, Know Your Customer (KYC) and cyber security service providers.
    * Customer ‘interface’ providers (like the ones who manage our in-app chat service).
.
  * Companies that do advertising for us (but we won’t share identifiable personal data with third parties for their own direct marketing unless you give us permission, and you can opt out any time).
  * Certain authorities that detect and prevent terrorism (including authorities outside the UK if one of your payments is processed through a worldwide payment system).
  * Anyone who you give us explicit permission to share it with.



We’ll also share it to comply with the law; to enforce our Terms and Conditions or other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our customers or others.

### How long we keep it 📁

We keep your data as long as you’re using Monzo, and for 6 years after that to comply with the law. In some circumstances, like cases of anti-money laundering or fraud, we may keep data longer if we need to and/or the law says we have to.

### Your rights ✅

You have a right to:

  * Access the personal data we hold about you, or to get a copy of it.
  * Make us correct inaccurate data.
  * Ask us to delete, 'block' or suppress your data, though for legal reasons we might not always be able to do it.
  * Object to us using your data for direct marketing and in certain circumstances ‘legitimate interests’, research and statistical reasons.
  * Withdraw any consent you’ve previously given us.



To do so, please contact us through the app or by emailing [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dab2bfb6aa9ab7b5b4a0b5f4b9b5b7).
