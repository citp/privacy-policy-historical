### H. Remarketing Applications 

#### I. Google AdWords Conversion

Monitis’ website uses Google AdWords, in order to generate attention for our services by using advertisement on third party websites. Based on data generated by such advertisement campaigns, we are able to determine the success rate of our advisement campaigns. Thereby, Monitis tries to provide you with advertisement that is of interest to you, to make its website more interesting, and calculates advertising expenses fairly. Legal basis for such processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Such means of advertisement are delivered by Google AdWords. Provided you clicked on an ad delivered by Google and which redirected you to our website, a cookie is stored on your computer by Google AdWords. These cookies usually expire within 30 days and are not supposed to be used to personally identify a user. In addition to these cookies, analytic values like unique cookie ID, quantity of Ad impressions per storing, last impression and opt-out information (markings that the user does not want to be addressed any further) are usually stored. These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser. If you visit certain pages on our website and provided the cookie stored on your computer has not yet expired, Monitis and Google are able to recognize that you clicked on an ad and were redirected to the Monitis website. Every Google AdWords customer gets a different cookie. Therefore, cookies cannot be tracked across sites by AdWords customers. Monitis does not process personal data by and through the aforementioned advertisement campaigns. Monitis merely receives statistical evaluations from Google. By and through these statistical evaluations, we can plainly see which advertisement campaign was particularly effective. Any additional data generated by use of the advertisement is not forwarded to Monitis; particularly, we cannot identify users through this information. Through the marketing tool, your browser automatically connects to Google’s server. Google has subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield, further information can be obtained under [ www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework ](http://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework). Please note, that scope and further use of the data processed by Google are beyond Monitis’ control. We thus inform you based on our own knowledge: By integrating AdWords, Google receives information that you visited a particular Monitis website or part thereof, and/or that you clicked on one of our advertisements. If you are registered with one of Google’s services, Google is able to match your visit to your Google account. Google may receive your IP address and/or may store it even if you are not registered with one of Google’s services and/or if you have not been logged in. You may avoid tracking in various ways: 

a) Through a setting of your browser software, particularly, by suppressing third party cookie installation that will prevent that you receive third party ads;

b) Through deactivating AdWords Cookies, by setting your browser so that cookies from www.googleadservices.com are being blocked; this can be done under [www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads), however, such settings are deleted if you delete cookies;

c) Through permanently deactivating cookies in your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome under www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. Please note that if you deactivate these cookies, you may not be able to use all functionalities of our website.
