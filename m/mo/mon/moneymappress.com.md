# Privacy Policy

Money Map Press takes individual privacy very seriously. We are also aware of the threats to your security and privacy on the Internet. Please take a few moments to review the steps that Money Map Press takes to ensure your privacy and security while giving you the best possible customer service as you use our web sites.

**Policy against advertising our website using unsolicited email messages**

We require that all e-mails promoting MoneyMapPress.com or its products are sent only to clients who have agreed to receive such messages. We prohibit any advertising of our brand and Web site using unsolicited email messages. Not complying with this policy will cause partnership termination and/or affiliate account termination.

If you feel you’ve been sent unsolicited emails promoting our brand or website and would like to register a complaint, please email our abuse department (customerservice@moneymappress.com). We will immediately investigate all allegations made related to unsolicited messages.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive by an Internet server when you visit a web site. Some cookies can be used to identify your computer each time you visit a site.

Money Map Press web site only uses cookies to allow authentication for access to the Subscriber Only areas of our sites.

In other words, you can leave the site and come back without having to re-enter your user name and password every time (within a set time period). We do not use cookies to track your browsing habits or collect any information about you.

**Submitting Data**  
At no time are you required to submit personal information to access any area of the Money Map Press site. Visitors to our other sites are asked to submit a log-on name and password to visit Subscriber Only sections of the sites. This is to ensure you can receive the services you are paying for.

**Ordering Online  
**Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer – an encryption protocol – and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall.

In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.

Money Map Press does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees of Money Map Press ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other Money Map Press products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it.

If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please click here to contact our customer service department.

**E-mail**  
If you subscribe to Money Map Press, your name and e-mail address will be placed in a database. As with all other personal information, only employees of Money Map Press have access to this data. We do not give Money Map Press addresses to outside companies.

Any e-mail you send to Money Map Press is completely confidential. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity. Remember, in this case we are only asking you to confirm information you have already given us.
