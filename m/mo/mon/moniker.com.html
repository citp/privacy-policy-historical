<div class="boxcontent1"><div class="boxcontent2">

    <p>Moniker.com  and Moniker Marketplace are owned and operated by Moniker Online Services, LLC (“Moniker”).&nbsp; At Moniker, we take  your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use  information about you as you utilize any Moniker services. Our Privacy Policy  is subject to change, so we encourage you to visit this page frequently to  review our practices. By using services provided by Moniker, you indicate that  you agree to the collection and use of your information by Moniker as outlined  in this Privacy Policy.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Why We  Collect Information</strong><br>
      First and foremost, Moniker collects information to allow us to provide and improve  our services and to present you with information and features that we believe  will interest you. We also use your information to measure our success and  performance. For example, aggregate information gives us an idea of the number  of visitors we attract and how they navigate our site.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong><br>
      Any personal information that is collected by us is provided by you strictly on  a voluntary basis. We may receive personal information from you in a number of  ways, depending on the Moniker service you are using and your choices while  using our services. Depending upon the nature of the service being provided, we  may ask you for, and you may choose to send to us, your name, e-mail address,  physical address or other personal information necessary to complete a  transaction, provide services to you, enter a contest or take a survey.&nbsp; For example, personal information is  requested when you register to be a user of our services. During registration,  you are asked to provide your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal  or zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests, etc. The more  information you submit and the more accurate it is, the better we are able to  tailor our services to your needs.<br>
      Please  note that when you purchase or use our services, you also represent to us that  you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals  whose personal data you supply to us with regard to: (i) the purposes for which  such third party's personal data have been collected, (ii) the intended  recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data,  (iii) which of the third party's data are required to be provided to use our  services and which data, if any, are voluntary, and (iv) how the third party  can access and, if necessary, change the data held about them<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Use of  Personal Information</strong><br>
      As noted above, unless you voluntarily provide personal information for a  specific purpose, we do not collect personal information from you. If you  choose to provide personal information, we use your personal information to  provide you with particular services that you request. For instance, we may use  your personal information to contact you about services that you have requested  and to provide you with data about the services. &nbsp;More specifically, when you provide us with  your email address, we will use your e-mail information to send you  outbid offer notices and notices regarding the closing of transactions. In  addition, we may use your e-mail for other features requiring e-mail  notifications. <br>
      We  may also share your personal information with business partners who provide  services you have requested. In these cases, we will provide only the  information that is needed to perform the service. If you do not want Moniker  to share your information in this way, you can simply choose not to sign up for  the service in question. By providing your email address to Moniker, you  expressly consent to receive emails from us.</p>
    <p>In  addition to the examples above, we may also use your personal information as  otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy or in any other manner in which you  may consent, including any such consent granted by you under any Terms and  Conditions that govern the services you use.&nbsp;  When your  consent is required for use of personal information that is not otherwise  authorized by this Privacy Policy or the applicable Terms and Conditions for a  service, we will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information  is collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or  by other means (such as sending you an e-mail).<br>
      <br>
      Moniker does not sell personal information to other companies. However, we will  transfer personal information in connection with a sale or merger of Moniker or  the division responsible for the services provided to you and we may share  personal information with our corporate affiliates. We may also share your  personal information with our technical consultants, third party auditors and  other third parties who make our site available, enhance its functionality or  provide associated services and/or who deal with you in processing your orders  and/or delivering content, products, services and gifts and prizes. These third  parties are not allowed to use personal information except for the purposes of  providing the applicable services. </p>
    <p>In  addition, you acknowledge and agree that, Moniker may make available and use  personal information or other information you provide or that we otherwise  maintain, to public or private third parties: (i) for inspection by law  enforcement officials (including in the case of potential criminal activity);  (ii) to respond to criminal and civil subpoenas and court orders that  reasonably appear to be valid; (iii) to enforce or apply the terms of this  Privacy Policy or any other agreement between us; and (iv) to protect the  rights, property, or safety of Moniker, our users, or others, whether during or  after the term of your use of our service. </p>

      <br>
      <strong>Supplementation  of Information</strong><br>
      In order for our site to perform properly and as necessary to perform or enhance  our services, we may supplement the information we receive on this site with  information from third party sources.

As another example, we may combine cookie data gathered on  this site with cookie data from a third party in order to improve our services.<br>
      <br>
