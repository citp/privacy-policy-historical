	<p>Date: March 26th, 2011<br>
Welcome to Mondelio.it ("Site"), an online service designed to provide language learning content, language learning curriculum, and to facilitate language exchanges and foreign language practice.  Mondelio.it is owned and operated by Mondelio A.C, and is committed to safeguarding your privacy, and this privacy policy explains our data collection, use, and disclosure practices. If you have specific questions about these practices, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:support@mondelio.it">support@mondelio.it</a>.</p><br>

	<div style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold">1. Information collected</div><br>
	<p>When you register with Mondelio.it, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your spoken and learning languages, your gender, and any other personal or prefer-ence information that you enter.</p><br>
	<p>When you use Mondelio.it, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, per-form searches and queries, enroll in events and courses, and transmit information through various chan-nels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list.</p><br>
	<p>You can choose not to provide this information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register and participate in the features offered through the Site.</p><br>
	<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site. Mondelio.it may attempt to send invitations more than once. Mondelio.it stores this information to send email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mondelio.it">support@mondelio.it</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p><br>
	<p>We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit the Site. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and referring web site. We also may collect information about your activity on this Site, such as the courses in which you enroll. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help improve your user experience.</p><br>
	<p>Finally, when you visit the Site, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) to remember who you are. For example, if you register on the Site, we may record your username in a cookie for verification purposes. We also may include other information in our cookie files; for example, if you arrived at our Site via a link from third party site, we may include the URL of the linking page.</p><br>

	4. Using cookies (see below)<br><br>
	<p>In order to measure the success of Mondelio's online advertising Mondelio use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to establish which of Mondelio's online adverts successfully bring people to it's website or the sites of Mondelio's affiliates. The GIF files are provided by third parties who provide Mondelio with online advertising analysis. This system places a cookie on Mondelio's browser when a consumer enters Mondelio's website via an online advert allowing Mondelio to see which online adverts bring Mondelio the most visitors to its website. The information collected on Mondelio's behalf, is anonymous and does not personally identify the consumer. The information does not contain the consumers name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but a consumer can change its browser to reject them. Even without a cookie a consumer can still use Mondelio's website. If a consumer would like to know how to opt-out of the technologies mentioned above the consumer can contact Mondelio's helpdesk.</p><br>

	<p>Web sites to which this Site links do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on those other web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.</p><br>
	
	<div style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold">8. Third party advertising</div><br>
