### 3.4 Other Reasons We May Contact You

If you’re providing us with another person’s personal information you should first ask them to read this Privacy Policy and our [Terms and Conditions](http://moneybulldog.co.uk/site-disclaimer/). By giving us personal information about another person you are confirming that they have given you consent to provide the personal information to us and that they understand how their details will be used.

We do not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 16. If you are aged under 16 please get your parent or guardian’s permission before you provide any personal information to us.

We will periodically review your personal information to ensure that we do not keep it for longer than is permitted by law (see section 6 below).

## 4\. How and why we process your personal information

We will only collect and use your personal information (as described in sections 2 and 3) in accordance with data protection laws. Our grounds for processing your personal information are as follows:

**Consent**  – Where necessary we will only collect and process your personal information if you have consented for us to do so.

**Legitimate Interests**  – We may use and process some of your personal information where we have sensible and legitimate business grounds for doing so. Under European privacy laws there is a concept of “legitimate interests” as a justification for processing your personal information. Our legitimate interests for processing your personal information are:

  * to enable you to access and use the Site;
  * to improve our Site. We may use your personal information to undertake demographic segmentation and generate profiling information to help us understand what you might be interested in and for market research. We are always working to make a better Site for you and using your personal information in this way helps us to do this.



From May 2018, you will have a right to object to our use of your personal information for these legitimate interests, including a right to object to profiling by us (see section 9 below).

## 5\. Disclosure of the information we collect

The personal information you enter when registering on our Site or that we collect when you use our Site is confidential and except in the circumstances mentioned below, we will not disclose it to any third party.

We may disclose the information described at clause 2 to a third party in the following circumstances:

  * If required or permitted to do so by law;
  * If required to do so by any court, the Financial Conduct Authority or any other applicable regulatory, compliance, governmental or law enforcement agency;
  * If necessary in connection with legal proceedings or potential legal proceedings;
  * If ownership of all or part of our Site is transferred, in which case any purchaser would only be entitled to use that information in a way consistent with this Privacy Policy;
  * In line with our own Terms and Conditions of Use



## 6\. How long do we keep your personal information for?

Unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, we will only hold your personal information on our systems for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or until you request it is deleted. Even if we delete your personal information it may persist on back-up or archival media for legal, tax or regulatory purposes.

## 7\. How are we keeping your personal information secure?

Keeping information about you secure is very important to us so we store and process your personal information in accordance with the high standards required under data protection legislation. All personal information we collect is encrypted and stored in the UK. From time to time and for operational reasons the personal information we collect from you may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Your information may also be processed by some of our service providers which operate outside the EEA. Different countries have different data protection and security laws and some of these do not offer the same level of protection as you enjoy under UK data protection legislation. However, when we appoint our service providers to help us provide products and services to you (which may include some based in the USA), we take care to ensure that they have appropriate security measures in place and utilise data centers in the UK wherever possible.

You may complete a registration process when you sign up to use parts of our Site. This may include the creation of a username, password and/or other identification information. Any such details should be kept confidential by you and should not be disclosed to or shared with anyone. Where you do disclose any of these details, you are solely responsible for all activities undertaken on our Site where they are used. To protect your account, we ask you to choose a strong password to access your data on our Site. A strong password should include a mixture of letters and numbers. This password must be unique and must not be used anywhere else or for any other purpose. Your password can only be reset with access to the email address registered in our system.

We do our best to keep the information you disclose to us secure. However, we can’t guarantee its security. By using our Site you accept the inherent risks of providing information online and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security.

## 8\. How and why we use cookies and IP addresses

### 8.1 IP address

When you use parts of our site, we log the IP addresses of users’ computers which we use solely for administration and troubleshooting purposes.

  * to improve the functionality and performance of the Site;

Plus, if you don’t want to be contacted by us anymore you can email DataRequest@moneybulldog.co.uk. This clause 9 sets out your other information rights.

If you raise an objection we will stop processing your personal information unless very exceptional circumstances apply, in which case we will let you know why we’re continuing to process your personal information.

We will use reasonable efforts consistent with our legal duty to provide you with your rights in accordance with data protection legislation. At our discretion, we may charge £10 for information requests that are excessive, particularly if it is repetitive or for further copies of the same information.
