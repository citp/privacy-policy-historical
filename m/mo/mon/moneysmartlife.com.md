**What information does Money Smart Life collect from our users?**  
If you’ve signed up for email updates or our newsletter you’re aware that we require an email address in order to deliver daily site updates and that we personalize the newsletter by asking for your first name. In terms of site visitors, we track aggregated visitor and clickthrough data using [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics). We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

**How do we use this information?**  
We are happy to offer personal finance coverage and thank you for trusting us with your time and email address so we can deliver updates to you. Our goal is to help you master your money. We’ve found that a personal approach works the best in matters of motivation so we use your first name to customize your newsletter. It goes without saying that your name and email address are safe with us and will be kept private. Any aggregated visitor and clickthrough information collected is to help us analyze the most and least popular sections of the site so we can adjust for a better visitor experience.

**What are cookies and how do we use them?**  
Cookies are extremely small text files that help track a person’s “session” while online. By showing how and when our visitors use this web site, this information can help us to continue to improve our web site. We use the Google Analytics service, which uses cookies, to help us analyze traffic to this web site. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser so permits.

**How do we store your information?**  
We protect and manage the contact information of newsletter subscribers with a premier newsletter service that’s a market leader in email privacy and security, Aweber Communications.  For those that subscribe to daily site updates via email, those services are provided by another industry leader, Feedburner. You can unsubscribe from both the Feedburner or Aweber updates at any time with the link at the bottom of your emails.
