5.1.7.1. if you give us your driving licence number when obtaining a  **motor insurance quote** , it may be submitted by us or our partners to the DVLA MyLicence service  in order to verify the status of your (or any named driver's) licence and entitlement along with any relevant restriction information, endorsement and/or conviction data. The insurers may carry out the searches themselves or we may perform them and then pass the results to the insurers.  These driving licence searches may be made when you first use our Services and subsequently throughout the duration of your insurance policy. These searches will not show on your (or your named driver's) DVLA driving licence record. Carrying out these searches may help insurers to prevent fraud and reduce the need for insurers to cancel policies for negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure of important information.  For details of the information about you that the DVLA may hold, please see [ **http://www.mylicence.org.uk/**](http://www.mylicence.org.uk/).

5.1.7.2. If you use the  **MoneySuperMarket App to receive car alerts  **(see section 10 of our  **[Terms and Conditions](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/legal/terms/) **and section 4.2.5.2 of this Privacy Policy) ** ** or otherwise sign up (outside of the MoneySuperMarket App) to receive  **car tax and MOT reminders via email**  (see section 4.2.5.2), we can match your car registration number with public sector information to obtain the dates that your car tax and MOT will need renewing so that we can send you reminders before these fall due.  This car tax and MOT information is accessed by us from public sector information under the terms of the [ **Open Government Licence 3.0**](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/tQvxCk5J5Hnj2yWHQvOVj?domain=nationalarchives.gov.uk). MoneySuperMarket does not warrant the accuracy of any information relating to your vehicle’s MOT and tax status, and does not accept any liability for any inaccurate information accessed by it in this way.

**5.2. Credit Information Services & Soft Credit Checks**

When you use the Services a ‘soft’ credit check may be carried out against your credit report by our service providers for the following purposes:

5.2.1. to enable our  **eligibility checker services** ; and

5.2.2 to provide you with your credit history including your credit score and/or credit report (as applicable) when you use the  **Credit Monitor Services** ).

Many of our partners will also carry out checks with credit reference agencies when they generate a quote for comparison both at the time you  **request a quote**  and at  **renewal**. You should read their privacy policy for more information on how they carry out these checks (see 5.3.2. for further information).

**‘Soft’ credit checks**  are carried out by using credit reference agencies in order to (i) assess your financial and insurance profile; (ii) verify your identity; and/or (iii) to help prevent fraud.  The credit reference agencies may keep a record of the search and you may see this recorded against your credit file but these ‘soft’ credit checks have no impact on your credit rating. ‘Soft’ credit checks are visible on your credit report but do not show up in the same way as a 'hard' check.  Where a ‘soft’ credit check is required for our eligibility checker service or our Credit Monitor Services we engage the following service providers: 

5.2.3.        Capital One plc ("Capital One"), HD Decisions - an Experian business ("HD"), Shawbrook Bank Limited (“Shawbrook”) and other credit cards and loans providers, who in turn partner with the following UK credit reference agencies: TransUnion and Experian Ltd ("Experian") from time to time to enable our  **eligibility checker services**.  If you use our eligibility services, a credit report will be generated by carrying out a 'soft' credit check.  The ‘soft’ credit checks will be used by Capital One, HD and Shawbrook and other providers, to match against those providers' own lending criteria. This information will be used to let you know your percentage chances of successfully obtaining a credit card or loan. Note that your credit report will not be provided to you directly and we will not receive it either unless you use our Credit Monitor Services (see paragraph 5.2.4).  For further information about how your details will be used please see the rest of our Privacy Policy and [ **Capital One's and HD's and Shawbrook’s  **](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/terms-general-consent/)own terms and conditions.

5.2.4.       If you use our Credit Monitor Services we will pass on your personal information to TransUnion and your credit history and related information will be obtained from them. References to “TransUnion” in this Privacy Policy mean TransUnion International UK Limited (company number 0496832), which is part of the TransUnion Information Group.  TransUnion is a credit reference agency authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority under number 737740, whose registered office is at One Park Lane, West Yorkshire, LS3 1EP. Authorisation can be checked on the Financial Services Register at [ **www.fca.org.uk**](https://www.fca.org.uk/).

The Credit Monitor Services will leave ‘soft’ credit checks, which are visible to you on your credit report but do not show up to other organisations in the same way as a 'hard' check.  For further information about how your information will be used please see the rest of our Privacy Policy and our [ **Terms of Use**](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/legal/terms/). Please also read TransUnion's own [ **privacy policy**](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/legal/transunion/) for information about how they obtain, use and share your personal information.

5.2.5         We also use TransUnion’s services as part of our identity verification procedures. Please see their separate [ **Bureau Privacy Notice**](https://www.callcredit.co.uk/legal-information/bureau-privacy-notice) for more information about this.

**5.3. Who might our partners share your personal  information with?**

In order to provide you with a quote, our partners may exchange information about you with other companies and/or carry out checks with various databases. Our partners act as data controllers in respect of this use of personal information and we are not responsible for it. We have set out below some of the common ways they will share your information:

5.3.1.  Some of our partners will use your personal information to  **assess your circumstances**  (including information about any third party who is named on the policy) and verify the information that you have provided before providing a quote to you;

5.3.2.  Some partners may carry out checks with  **fraud prevention**  and  **credit reference agencies** , both when you first run your quote and when we run an annual renewal quote.  Insurers generally run these checks to ensure that they and credit partners have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and to provide you with their best premium and payment options).  If partners do these checks, they will be quotation searches only and do not show up on your credit report in the same way that a ‘hard’ check does, but will be visible to other organisations. Both public data (e.g. the electoral roll) and private data (e.g. your personal credit history) may be checked in this way; 

5.3.3.  Some partners may carry out  **checks against data they already hold on you** , (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies) such as data from existing products, account data, data from previous product transactions, accounts you may hold with them or loyalty scheme data to share with insurers in order to determine your premium;

5.3.4.  Our partners may also exchange data with  **certain industry databases**  such as the No Claims Discount Database, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (which holds records of incidents reported to insurers that may or may not have resulted in a claim) and the Hunter Database (a central insurance and claims checking system).  If our partners carry out these searches, a record of the search will appear on your credit report; 

5.3.5.  Some of our partners may also check  **public and private higher education sources**  to obtain information about your educational background; and

5.3.6.  Our partners may also share information with  **insurance underwriters**. These checks are not unique to users of our Services - they may also be carried out if you obtain quotes from other sources.

This information exchange allows our partners to verify the information that is provided during the quote process (including information about any third party who is named on the policy), and also helps to detect fraudulent claims. 

If you decide to enter into a contract with one of our partners through any of the Sites, the information you have provided to us, together with any further information requested by, and supplied by you or us to the partner, will be held by the partner  for the purposes set out in their privacy policy and they will act as data controller of your personal information.  Therefore,  **you are strongly advised to read your chosen provider's privacy policy**  and satisfy yourself as to the purposes for which the provider will use your personal information before entering into the contract. We have no responsibility for the uses to which a provider puts your personal information.
