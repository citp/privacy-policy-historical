4.4 Use-based online advertising

At this point, we would like to provide you with comprehensive information on the topic of usage-based online advertising. Our website or the website from which you have just been linked, anonymously collects and processes your usage behavior. As a result, you benefit as a user by receiving advertising that is more in line with your interests and by delivering less randomly distributed advertising. To record your usage behavior, a cookie is stored on your device. Cookies are small text files that are stored on the hard disk of your computer and allow the recognition, but do not allow personal identification of your person. In order to optimize advertising based on your interests, we work with different providers. At the same time, these purposes are legitimate interests of Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 

Information is collected about your activities on this website (e.g., surfing behavior, visited subpages of the internet site). All usage data is stored using a pseudonym, so that a personal identification is basically excluded. In general, you can prevent the storage of cookies on your hard disk by selecting "Do not accept cookies" in your browser settings. You can also set your browser to ask you before you set cookies whether you agree. Finally, you can delete once set cookies at any time. How this works in detail, please refer to the help pages of your browser. If you do not accept cookies, this may result in functional restrictions of the website in individual cases. Please note that in the event of cookies being deleted, you may need to reactivate opt-out cookies that have been set. For the data collection for the delivery of usage-based online advertising, we use the following providers: 

Visit [www.youronlinechoices.com/de/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/) to learn more about usage-based online advertising and individual providers. There they also have the opportunity to object to the usage-based online advertising by single or all providers. 

We use Google's cross-device remarketing technologies to help you see targeted advertising on other websites based on your visit to our websites. 

How does remarketing work?

When you visit our websites, it is possible for Google to retrieve recognition features for your browser or device (e.g., creating a so-called browser fingerprint), evaluate your IP address or a recognition feature in the form of a small text file on your device stores (e.g., a so-called third-party cookie). It is also possible that Google links and stores your visit to our website with one or more of these recognition features in order to display our advertising on other sites on the Internet. 

The above-mentioned recognition features are configured as pseudonyms and can be used by Google to recognize your device on other websites. For example, if you visit a page that participates in Google's Display Network (ie displays ads on behalf of Google), Google may recognize your device and browser based on the above mentioned features. 

We can also provide our websites with so-called "remarketing tags". This means that we include keywords in our websites that contain statements about the content of the displayed page (such as product or service categories). The keywords we use have neither personal nor sensitive information. Google receives and stores these keywords to the above mentioned recognition features. So, when you visit a page that we tagged with a particular product category, Google stores that tag and assigns it to your recognition criteria. 

By doing this, we can use Google to advertise on other websites that are based on the visited pages . If you are visiting another website that participates in the Google Display Network, Google will be able to tell you, based on the recognition features and the keywords stored on these recognition features, whether and, if so, which of our advertisements you want to see. 

Optimizing advertising based on your interests is a legitimate interest of Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 

For more information about how Google Remarketing technologies work, visit <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/>. 

If you sign up for Google services with your own login credentials or use one or more of your own Google accounts, Google can combine the recognition features of different browsers and end devices. So, if Google has ever created its own recognition feature for the laptop, desktop, or smartphone or tablet you're using, these recognition features can be associated with each other once you've used or used a Google service with your login information. In this way, Google can target our advertising campaigns beyond end devices. However, Google will do so only if you have consented to this data processing in the past to Google. 

How can I object to advertising?

You can object to this form of advertising at any time. Please visit this page <https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922> and disable personalized ads. Please note that these settings may not affect all devices and browsers. Further information is also available at <https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922>. 

4.6 Google Conversion Tracking

To advertise our website, we also use the Google advertising tool "Google Adwords Conversion" from Google Inc. If you have reached our website via a Google ad, a cookie is stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that your Internet browser stores and saves on your computer. These so-called "conversion cookies" lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not expired yet, we and Google may recognize that you, as a user, have clicked on one of our Google-placed ads and have been redirected to our site. 

The information obtained through the "Conversion Cookies" is used by Google to create visitor statistics for our website. These statistics tell us the total number of users who clicked on our ad, and which pages on our site were subsequently accessed by their respective users. However, we or others through "Google Adwords" advertisers do not receive any information that personally identifies users. At the same time, these purposes constitute our legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 

To learn how to prevent the installation of "Google conversion cookies", visit this page from Google: <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/>. or more information about cookies and Google's privacy policy, please see the link below: [https://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html](https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html).
