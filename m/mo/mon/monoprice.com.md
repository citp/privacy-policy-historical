**Privacy Policy**

We at Monoprice.com understand many people are concerned about the safety of transferring their personal information on the Internet. We work hard to ensure your information is safe. At Monoprice.com, we respect and value our customers and their privacy. The personal information you submit to us is used for purchase processing and account maintenance purposes only. This information is used to better serve our customers and will not be transferred to a third party for any reason.

**Secure Shopping Guaranteed**

Your security is our primary concern. To ensure safe shopping, we use Verisign® 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption security, which is the highest level of security available today for secure e-commerce transactions. All pages containing your personal information, including credit card numbers, name, and address are encrypted while in transit. That means it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. SSL encryption makes shopping on the Internet the safest way to use your credit card. It is much safer than making a purchase in a store or charging your dinner in a restaurant.

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users… information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ?surfing…. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users… information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers… information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
