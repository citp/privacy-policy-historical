Otherwise we can use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. 

In some instances, we can combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined. 

**How We Can Collect Other Information**

We and our third party service providers can collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including: 

**Through your browser or device** : Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, device performance benchmarks and capabilities, installed plugins, mouse clicks or cursor position, page scroll position, time spent on the services, pages visited, referral pages and keywords used if coming from a search engine, language, Internet browser type and version, the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using, and other anonymous traffic data. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly and to personalize your experience while using the Services. For example, we may use and combine such information, in combination with IP address, to create a unique ID that identifies your browser or device to us with reasonable certainty. This unique ID enables us to track your activity on our Services and to display content that we believe will interest you based on such activity. 

**Through your use of the App** : If you download and use the App, we and our service providers track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App. 

**Using cookies** : Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Services, as well as for online tracking purposes. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Services in order to continually improve the design and functionality, understand how the Services are used and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Services. 

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to [ http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html ](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html) However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.

**IP Address** : Your “ **IP Address** ” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

**Physical Location:** We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using IP address, satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We can use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such uses, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content. 

**From you** : Information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services.
