	<li>We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.

<h3>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>Monstercockland allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Monstercockland Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Monstercockland Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>

<p>Monstercockland does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Monstercockland to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>

<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Monstercockland's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>

<p>Monstercockland uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.

Once we receive your transmission of information, Monstercockland makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<p>If Monstercockland learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Monstercockland may post a notice on the Monstercockland Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify <a href="http://monstercockland.com/help/">customer service</a>.</p>
