<h2>Privacy and Cookie policy</h2>
<p>This is the privacy policy for The One Place Capital Limited (trading as Money Dashboard), a company registered in Scotland (company number SC301187) with a registered office at 5th Floor, 125 Princes Street, Edinburgh, EH2 4AD (“we”, “us”, “our”) in relation to the use of personal information provided in relation to the use of the website and online account and personal finance management services provided at <a href="https://www.moneydashboard.com" target="_self">www.moneydashboard.com</a> (“the Service”).</p>
<p>We know that you’ll want to know exactly what information we gather about you as a user of our Service (“User”), and how we intend to use (and just as importantly, not use) that information.</p>
<p>We'll try to keep everything in this document as straightforward as possible, but if there’s anything you don’t understand or you’re not happy about, or if you just want to suggest improvements, please get in touch with us by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@moneydashboard.com">info@moneydashboard.com</a></li>
<li>Writing to the Chief Executive Officer, Money Dashboard, 18 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh EH2 4DF.</li>
</ul>
<p>Money Dashboard has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through <a href="https://www.moneydashboard.com" target="_self">www.moneydashboard.com</a>.</p>
<p>TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organisations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.

<h3>Information Which We May Collect</h3>
<p>You do not have to supply any information simply to visit the site.</p>
<p>To register to use our service you will have to supply us with personal information. “Personal Information” means information that identifies you. The personal information we collect to register you is your e-mail address. In order to add your financial accounts, you will also need to provide your UK postcode and date of birth, and choose a secure question and answer. If you use our functionality to refer a friend, we will collect their email address from you. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@moneydashboard.com">support@moneydashboard.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database. Once you have aggregated accounts with us (see “Other people who have to be able to access your information” below for an explanation) , we will have access to that account information.</p>
<p>We keep track of the internet addresses from which Users visit us, and track the page(s) on our site that you visit. We analyse this data for trends and statistics. Please see “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies”.</p>
<h3>How we use your information</h3>
<p>We will use the personal information which we collect for the purposes of registering you as a User of our services, correspondence, or participating in online surveys to help us enhance our services and products for you, and to send a one-time email to your friends about our site upon your request.</p>
<p>We also ask for personal information at the point at which you add a financial account to enable us to ask security related questions if you later ask us to reset your password.</p>
<p>In addition, through a computer system-run process, we will use your personal information and information from your account aggregation for the purposes of analysing it and making suggestions which may enable you to make savings or consider alternative or additional products to the ones which you are using. These suggestions can be delivered either in the service or by way of email or text messages to you. This may involve us sending limited details about you (which will not identify you) to our partners so that we can tailor suggested products for you more accurately.</p>
<p>Any information we collect is used to improve the content of the site, enhance Users' experiences when visiting our site, and customise the content and/or layout of our pages.</p>
<p>We also use personal information in performing statistical analysis of Users’ behaviour as a whole; and to help in the creation of anonymised statistical data which we may use at our discretion (including licensing to third parties).</p>
<p>We do not share personal information for any reason that is not disclosed in this Policy or apparent to you at the time the information is requested and we do not sell or rent any personal information.</p>
<h3>Other people who have to be able to access your information</h3>
<p>We use a company called Yodlee Inc. (<a href="http://www.yodlee.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.yodlee.com</a>) to provide software that lets you add details of the accounts which you want to include in the service (“account aggregation”). When you aggregate an account Yodlee collects and securely stores your log in details, such as User name and password. This information is never stored by us nor subsequently disclosed to us and is subject to Yodlee’s privacy policy. For further information on how Yodlee keeps your information secure please visit <a href="http://yodlee.com/yodlee-security/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://yodlee.com/yodlee-security/</a>. Yodlee are headquartered in the USA. They have provided account aggregation to top UK &amp; USA financial institutions for more than 10 years. We have a contract with Yodlee which requires them to be bound by our privacy policy and to meet the requirements of the Data Protection Act in just the same way as it applies to us.</p>
<h3>The information we may give to or share with somebody else</h3>
<p>We may have to disclose your personal information, if required by law to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or similar legal requirement.</p>
<p>We may share your personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>

<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud;</li>
<li>if Money Dashboard is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information;</li>
<li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
</ul>

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h3>How long we keep your data</h3>
<p>Once deleted by you the data will be promptly deleted from our systems and we will subsequently be unable to access it.</p>

<h3>Use of email and text</h3>
<p>You can use the service to provide you with email and text alerts to provide you with useful information, e.g. your current account is close to becoming overdrawn. You can disable these alerts at any time by removing these alerts from within your Profile.</p>
<p>We may use email or text in relation to administrative matters, e.g. sending you a replacement password, or to let you know about changes to the service. An example of this would be a proposed change to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We will not email or text you in relation to promotional matters without your consent, other than explained in our terms and conditions. You can withdraw this consent at any time by contacting us as above or by following unsubscribe instructions within the email.</p>
