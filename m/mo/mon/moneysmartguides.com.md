Your privacy is very important to MoneySmartGuides. The following is in-depth detail to help you understand how MoneySmartGuides will collect, use, communicate, disclose and make use of personal information. I will not rent, sell, lease, or give away any of your personal information. The following outlines my privacy policy. Please read this privacy policy before using the site or submitting any personal information. By using the site, you accept the practices described here.

  * Before or at the time of collecting personal information, I will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
  * I will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by me and for other compatible purposes, unless I obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.

  * Comments: Comments left on the site are the responsibility of the commenter. I reserve the right to remove comments or edit them due to errors, inappropriate comments, or blatant self-promotion. I won’t censor comments. As for email addresses included in the comments, these are left at the discretion of the commenter.

**Log Files**

As with most other websites, I collect and use the data contained in log files.  The information in the log files include  your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

MoneySmartGuides does use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit the site.  This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit.

I also use third party advertisements to support this site.  Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they [advertise](http://moneysmartguides.com/advertise "advertise") on the site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit the site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing California real estate ads to someone in California, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this can affect how you are able to interact with this site as well as other websites.  This could include the inability to login to services or programs.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding your privacy and this site, please [contact me](mailto:contact@moneysmartguides.com "contact me").
