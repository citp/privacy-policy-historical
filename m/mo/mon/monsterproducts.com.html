        <br>
        Monster Cable Products, Inc. and its corporate affiliates ("Monster" or 
        "we") provide this Web Site Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate 
        our commitment to respect your privacy. This Web Site Privacy Statement 
        explains how we collect certain personal information at our Web Site at 
        www.monstercable.com and any permutations thereof that directly link to 
        this Website Privacy Statement ("Web Site"). This Web Site Privacy Statement 
        also explains how we use and disclose such information - it does not, 
        however, apply to our use of data that we collect otherwise (e.g., offline 
        or through web sites of our foreign subsidiaries). If you do not agree 
        with this Web Site Privacy Statement, please do not access or use our 
        Web Site. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Personal and Non-Personal Information</b><br>
        Generally, you can visit Monster on the Web without telling us who you 
        are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. 
        We collect no such information about you when you visit our Web Site unless 
        you choose to provide that information to us. Monster may request or collect 
        certain personally identifiable information from or about you ("Personal 
        Information") in certain circumstances, as described in this Web Site 
        Privacy Statement and in specific privacy notices (described at the end 
        of this Web Site Privacy Statement under the header "Situations in Which 
        you Submit Personal Information"). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Log Files and Aggregate Information</b><br>
        Like most website operators, we collect and use IP addresses from browsing 
        machines to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, 
        and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Monster does 
        not link this information with Personal Information about individual users. 
        We may share with potential partners our aggregated demographic information 
        and aggregated information about the transactions conducted on our Web 
        Site. Information we share for these purposes is generally not linked 
        to any Personal Information that can identify any individual person or 
        company. <br>
        <br>

        Our Web Site uses cookies to enhance your experience while visiting our

        to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, 
        it is possible that some areas of our sites will not function properly 
        when you view them. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Links</b><br>
        Our Web Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Monster 
        is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites, and

        statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable 
        information. <br>

        the right to do, at any time, effective immediately - we will post the 
        revised policy at this location, or at another location that is accessible 
        via link from our homepage, so that users are always aware of what information 
        we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose 
        it, on any given day. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information 
        in a manner that is substantially different from that stated at the time 
        it was collected, we will seek to notify users by way of an email, and 
        provide users with a choice as to whether or not we use their information 
        in this different manner. <br>
        <br>

        that such action is necessary to comply with a legal requirement, a court 
        order, request by law enforcement officials, or other legal process, or 
        to protect the rights, property, and safety of others or ourselves. We 
        also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities 
        that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. <br>
