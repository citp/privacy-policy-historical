<p>Updated as of January 22, 2009</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please see our contact details at the end of this document.</p>
<p><strong>Your privacy is our main concern</strong></p>
<p>Money-Rates.com has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of your personal information. The following discloses how we gather information, how that information is shared, and what practices Money-Rates.com implements to ensure your information is safe and protected.</p>
<p>Money-Rates.com does not require you to create an account or share any personally identifiable information in order to personally use the website <a href="../../../../../../">www.Money-Rates.com</a> (the "Website"). By visiting, using and/or submitting information to the Website you indicate your agreement with this Privacy Policy and Money-Rates.com' Terms of Use.</p>
<p><strong>What Non-Identifying Information Does Money-Rates.com Collect?</strong></p>
<p><em>Information Automatically Logged</em></p>
<p>Like most standard website servers, we gather information automatically from your browser or Internet session and store it in log files. This information includes your internet protocol (IP) address, the browser type that you are using, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform or operating system on your computer, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use this non-personally identifiable information to analyze trends, administer the Website, track user's movement in aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Money-Rates.com also utilizes third party software to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information. These vendors collect information such as your IP address and do not allow us to identify you personally. We do not share this non-identifiable information.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em></p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.&nbsp; We do not use cookies on our Website, however, some of our business partners use cookies on our Website (for example, advertisers). We have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. You may disable or reject cookies if your browser permits. Please be advised that this may prevent you from accessing certain features of the Website.</p>
<p><strong>What Personally Identifying Information Does Money-Rates.com Collect? </strong></p>
<p>Sign-up forms found on the Website, such as the form for newsletters and updates, the form for posting national rates and the form for advertising, collect information such as name, e-mail address and sometimes telephone number. Contact information from these forms is used to deliver the requested information. &nbsp;With respect to the newsletters and updates, users may opt-out of receiving such mailings in the future; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>If you elect to provide us with personal information, we may utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in follow-up communications from Money-Rates.com and our clients.</p>
<p>The non-personally identifiable information that we collect is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience and to evaluate the effectiveness of Internet properties. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements and to help determine which ads perform best, which content is most appropriate for different individuals, how our visitors use our Website, and which pages and features are most popular.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites </strong></p>
<p>This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Money-Rates.com. &nbsp;Money-Rates.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.

<p>Your non-personally identifiable information may be shared with third party partners of Money-Rates.com on an anonymous basis, for example, to track clicks on advertisements. We also share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our customers. This information does not identify individual users.</p>
<p><em>Service Providers and Agents</em></p>
<p>We partner with other third parties to provide specific services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
<p>Occasionally we hire other companies to provide other services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><em>Legally required disclosures</em></p>
<p>Money-Rates.com reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information as required by law, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the safety of users and to comply with judicial proceedings, court orders or legal processes served on the Website.</p>
