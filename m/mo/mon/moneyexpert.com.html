        <h2>Why we collect and use your personal information</h2>

       <p> MoneyExpert collect and use your personal details to allow us to provide the service which you are 
        seeking, and to enable us to ensure that our services are as personalised and accurate as 
        possible.  Personal information is required for us to be able to generate accurate quotes 
        for the products that you require.</p>
            



        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>By using our website, and completing an enquiry form, you will be regarded as having given your consent to MoneyExpert contacting you by phone, e-mail or otherwise to inform you about products and services that may be of interest to you.</p> 

        <p>MoneyExpert Limited use third party email service suppliers to send our customers emails.</p>

        <p>If you do not wish to be contacted by us via email in future, please click the unsubscribe link in the email and follow the instructions. We will then cease to contact your via email to offer products and services.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can email us at unsubscribe@moneyexpert.com, requesting that your email address is removed.</p>

        <p>MoneyExpert's price comparison service involves us passing the details you input on our website to our partners. This enables our partners to provide us with quotations on the products and services that you have requested. If you do decide to enter into a contract with one of our partners then the information which we have supplied to them (as well as any further information requested by them to enable to them to complete the contract) will be held by the partner. You are therefore advised to read the partners privacy policy before entering into any contract with them.</p>
        
        <p>We may also share your personal information with other professional advisers, financial organisations and advisers, sponsors and advertisers. Such parties may contact you by phone, e-mail or otherwise to inform you about any products and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer to opt out of such direct marketing activity, please let us know by any means convenient for you so that we may remove your personal data from our marketing database. However, please remember that by opting out, we will not be able to contact you about any products or services that may benefit you.</p> 

        <p>If you provide us with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them and they have given consent for you to process their personal data as set out above.</p>
        
        <p>If your enquiry is in regard to Mortgage advice, we will arrange for one of our partners to contact you by phone. In some circumstances, we may arrange for an alternative Mortgage Adviser to contact you. In these cases, we will notify you of the name of the adviser and request your permission for your details to be sent to them before any contact is made.</p> 

        <p>MoneyExpert may also disclose your personal information to government bodies and regulators where required to do so by law, or where necessary for MoneyExpert Limited to fulfil our regulatory obligations.</p>                
        



        <h3>Information disclosure outside of the UK</h3>
       <p> It is possible that, by using our services, your data will be transferred to companies outside of the European 
        Union, for example where the partners’ computer systems or calls centres are based abroad.  MoneyExpert will 
        only transfer your personal details outside of the European Union where the partner(s) have confirmed, via 
        contractual agreement, that they will hold and use your personal data in line with European Union standards.</p>

        <h2>Helping with your Insurance quotation</h2>
        By submitting an insurance quotation through our website, you agree that the top 3 Insurance providers and/or 
        brokerages in your search results may contact you by telephone for a limited time following the submission of 
        your enquiry.  This allows the insurance provider and/or brokerages to enquire as to whether you would like to 
        proceed with the quotation, and also allows them, where applicable, to see if they are able to present you with 
        any special offers, further discounts or incentives relating to the quotation you received.<p></p>

        <h2>Call Monitoring</h2>
      <p>  Phone calls to MoneyExpert may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes, in accordance with UK law.</p>

        <h2>Credit Reference Searches</h2>
       <p> Please note that our Trusted Business Partners may make, or cause searches to be made, at a credit reference 
        agency, or agencies. You should be aware that such searches will be shown in any other searches that are made in 
        connection with credit applications made by yourself or other members of your household. The disclosure of 
        multiple searches may adversely affect your credit profile and may make credit more difficult for you, or 
        other members of your household, to obtain.</p>

        <h2>Your rights to your personal information</h2>
       <p> You have the right to know what personal information we hold about you and to whom it has been disclosed.</p>

        <p>Please write to the address above, confirming that you are making a request for your personal information 
        under the Data Protection Act, and enclosing a fee of £10 made payable to MoneyExpert Limited. We are 
        entitled to charge you this fee under the Data Protection Act to cover our administration costs. </p>

        <p>MoneyExpert Limited aims to comply with requests for access to personal information as quickly as possible, but within 40 days.</p>

        <p>If any information we hold is inaccurate, we will make the necessary amendments and confirm to you have that these have been made.</p>   

        <h2>Tracking Data Policy</h2>
