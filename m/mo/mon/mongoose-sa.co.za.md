  * E-mail address



### the way we use information:

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We offer gift-cards and wish-lists by which you can personalize a product you order for another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card or wish-list is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

You can register with our website if you would like to receive our catalog as well as updates on our news and new products. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form and agree to receive this information.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with our distributors. For example, we may tell a distributor that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
