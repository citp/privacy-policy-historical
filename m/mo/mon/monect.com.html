                <p>
                    <strong>Cookies</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                    These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal

                    that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either

                    <strong>Service Providers</strong>
                </p>
                <p> I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>

                    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information.
                    The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not
                    to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                </p>

                    to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise
                    you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility
