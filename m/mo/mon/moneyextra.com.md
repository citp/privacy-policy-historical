# MX Moneyextra: Privacy of your information

**Privacy of your information**  
  


Your privacy is very important to us. 

Accordingly, we have put in place measures to ensure that any personal information or data that we obtain from you in connection with the Moneyextra website ("Website") is processed in accordance with the accepted principles of good information handling. 

**What data do we hold about you?**

We hold the personal data provided by you during the voluntary registration process to tailor our service to your specific interests and requirements. We also hold the personal data provided by you in relation to certain services on the Website (such as the Portfolio Manager), so that you do not need to re-enter this data when you next require the service. Clearly, the more complete and accurate the personal data we hold about you, the better our service will be. 

We only hold your personal data where you have been issued with a personalised user name and password. These are unique to each registered user. You should take great care of them and keep them safe at all times. 

**Where is your data stored?**

Moneyextra is a trading name of Chase de Vere Financial Solutions plc, which is the registered data controller of your personal data for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998. 

All personal data provided by you are held securely and in confidence by us in our computerised records. You have a right to inspect the data we hold about you at any time. If you wish to do so, you should write to our data protection compliance officer whose details are set out below. If anything in the data is inaccurate or out-of-date, let us know and we will amend our records. 

**How do we use your data?**

The nature of our service means that from time to time we have to share your personal data with our affiliates who provide the products and services that you request. For instance, if you want to apply for a particular financial product after using the comparison service or simply require more information about it, we will pass your relevant personal data to the product provider in order to fulfill your request. 

Occasionally, we may also contact you by phone, e-mail or otherwise to inform you about products and services which may be of interest to you. However, if you prefer to opt out of such direct marketing activity, please either call our Contact Centre on 0845 6000 900, or let us know by any means convenient for you so that we may remove your personal data from our marketing database. However, please remember that by opting out, we will not be able to contact you about products or services that may benefit you. 

We also extract certain information from your personal data for the purpose of generating statistics for our own internal purposes but it is not possible to identify you from these statistics. 

**What are "cookies" and how do we use them?**

We assign an individual number or "cookie" to each registered user of the Website that is saved on your computer. The cookie cannot be read by any other websites and it lasts only for the duration of your visit to our Website. 

We use cookies to personalise the service we offer to you. For instance, we can store your preferences for certain kinds of information or track your progress through the Website. This helps us to improve our service to you and tells us which areas of the Website are most relevant to you. 

**How do we keep your data secure and confidential?**

We use encryption and authentication procedures to protect any sensitive data we hold about you. In addition, all our staff have a responsibility for maintaining user confidentiality. We provide training and education to all our staff to remind them of their obligations, which are fully supported by our internal policies and procedures. 

We only pass your personal data to third parties where security and confidentiality is assured. 

**E-mail**

E-mail addresses are required in order to register for some features on the Website. Occasionally, we will send you special e-mail newsletters that may contain the latest financial information or keep you up-to-date with developments on the Website or the services we offer. 

In any e-mail we send, there are instructions that allow you to "unsubscribe" to this service should you not wish to receive e-mails in the future. 

**Telephone Calls**

If you call our Contact Centre, calls may be recorded or monitored for training purposes. 

**Transfer of the Website**

Notwithstanding anything else that has been agreed or represented (in this Privacy Policy, in the Terms of Use or otherwise) if the Website is transferred to another provider, we may transfer your personal data to the new provider provided the new provider undertakes (in terms which are enforceable by you) to hold it in accordance with the Privacy Policy. 

**Contact details**

Our data protection compliance officer is Alec Hughes and he can be contacted by writing to Chase de Vere Financial Solutions plc, Quay House, The Ambury, Bath, BA1 1UA.
