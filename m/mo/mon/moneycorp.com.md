The “lawful basis” we rely on to process your personal data 

Data Protection Law sets out six lawful basis that organisations, businesses and governments can rely on to collect and process personal data. Moneycorp predominately relies on the following:

**Consent**

This means processing your personal data where you have explicitly given us permission to do so.

**Performance of a Contract  **

This means processing your personal data in order to fulfil our contractual obligations with you.

**Legal Obligations  **

This means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject.

**Legitimate Interests  **

This means processing your personal data where we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. Where our interests are overridden by a negative impact on your rights, we will not process your personal data.

How do we use your personal data? 

We may process your personal data for the following purposes, depending on how you interact with us.

**1\. To complete the delivery of our foreign exchange, bank and international payment services (“Services”)**

Without your personal data, we would not be able to open your moneycorp account, facilitate your foreign exchange transactions and complete the delivery of our services. 

As part of our online account opening process, we will send you a one-off follow up registration email should you not complete the second page of the online account registration page. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests.

**2\. To respond to your queries and complaints**

Without your personal data, we would not be able to effectively respond and handle queries or complaints. We may keep a record of our correspondence to demonstrate how we communicated with you throughout. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests and our legal obligations.

**3\. To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations**

In order to meet our legal and regulatory requirements, we are required to carry out regulatory checks in order to prevent and detect fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other crimes. We are also required to send you communications known as ‘service messages’ in order to inform you about changes to the services we provide you. For example, changes to our terms and conditions and privacy policy, reserve and collect order confirmations and proof of payment confirmations _. **These service messages will not include any promotional content and cannot be unsubscribed from.**_

**4\. To analyse, test and improve our systems and databases**

We may use your personal data to ensure that our systems are tested thoroughly. This ensures that the system can cope with comparable volumes of information, that a wide range of realistic scenarios are covered, and that the test will reflect all the possible combinations that occur in the real environment. Test systems are isolated from external networks to ensure that live systems are not compromised. In addition, to ensure data is not compromised, we carry out various risk assessments, and have implemented safeguards to ensure data security. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests.

**5\. To develop new and improved products and services, including conducting market research and product analysis**

For this purpose, we will use cookies to personalise your next visits to our websites and to measure volumes and patterns of website usage. Full information can be found in our Cookie Policy[ here](https://web.archive.org/en-gb/legal/cookie-policy/). This includes information on how to adjust your browser settings to accept or reject cookies. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests.

**6\. For training and quality purposes**

We are continually reviewing the quality of the services we provide in order to improve your experience with Moneycorp. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests.

**7\. To keep you informed about relevant products, special offers and market news**

For existing customers who currently agree to receive marketing, we will continue to send you relevant products, special offers and market news unless you tell us otherwise. We will rely on our legitimate interests and the soft opt-in exception made available by the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 to do this.

For new customers, we will only keep you informed about relevant products, special offers and market news where you have explicitly consented

You are free to opt out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time by one of the options set out in the “Managing your marketing preferences” section of this Statement.

Who do we share your personal data with? 

We may share your personal data with the following entities for the purposes described in this Policy:

**1) Moneycorp subsidiaries, overseas branches and affiliate companies**

A complete and up-to-date list can be found in the “Definition and Glossary” section of this Policy.

**2) Third party service providers**

This includes:

  * Auditors and professional advisers such as lawyers and consultants.
  * Banks and financial services who facilitate our foreign exchange transactions and provide our Explorer Card product.

**4) Other third parties**

With your consent only, we may pass your data to a third party for their direct marketing purposes.

In the event we sell divisions of our business, we may disclose your personal data to prospective purchasers and their advisers so they can evaluate the relevant business.

If you have been referred to Moneycorp by a third party who you have a direct relationship with (e.g. an estate agent or an Independent Financial Advisor), we may provide such third party with personal data relating to you in which they are interested in by virtue of Moneycorp’s agreement with them and where your interests and data protection rights do not override those interests.

If you are a Sainsbury’s International Money Transfer customer, we will pass your name and contact details to Sainsbury’s Bank plc so they can remove you from marketing intended for individuals who are not yet Sainsbury’s International Money Transfer customers.

Please note our websites may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility for them. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

**Sharing your personal data outside the European Economic Area**

The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations both in and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

Where processed outside the EEA, we will take appropriate steps to ensure your personal data still receives a level of protection that is consistent with European data protection standards. For example, we will only share your personal data outside the EEA if we have an EU approved model clauses agreement in place or if the third party receiving your personal data has signed up to an EU approved data sharing mechanism such as the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme.

How do we protect your personal data? 

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

Personal data is protected by a defence in depth security programme that is aligned to best practice found in International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 20071) and National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) documentation. Protections include, but are not limited to, mature access control (with strict procedures around privileged access), network segmentation, standard security appliances (firewalls, IPS, AV, monitoring via SIEM), secure configuration and system hardening, monthly vulnerability assessments and yearly penetration tests, documented processes and procedures, DLP protection, rogue detection, and monthly rolling patch management and vulnerability remediation. Payment card information is tokenized to ensure it is protected. We also secure access to all transactional areas of our websites and apps using ‘https’.

All employees have to certify that they have read and understood the contents of our Data Protection Policy where is reviewed and updated on an annual basis. As well as our data protection policy, which governs how we process data throughout the Moneycorp Group, we have a separate suite of internal policies which govern areas such as information security and information classification.

Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we will only keep it for the purpose for which it was collected and in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations. In most cases, our retention period for your personal data will come to an end six years after the end of your relationship with us.
