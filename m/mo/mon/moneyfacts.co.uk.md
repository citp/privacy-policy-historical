## Moneyfacts.co.uk Privacy Policy

We have a legal obligation under Data Protection legislation to ensure that all information held and processed about you (the data subject) complies with the data protection principles and to uphold your rights as a data subject.

We also have responsibilities under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations to ensure you understand how our website works regarding cookies, online privacy and your browsing experience.

This Privacy and Cookie Policy details how we ensure information about you is kept secure and confidential, what legal basis we use to process your data and any third parties who it may be disclosed to. It also covers how we use cookies on our site.

Please read this policy carefully as once you use this site and/or any of our services or products you will be regarded as having accepted this policy. In particular, it means that you consent to cookies being used, as described below. By choosing to use the website, you are consenting to the use of cookies for these purposes.

If you do not accept this Privacy and Cookie Policy please do not use this site.

## Data protection legislation

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective 25 May 2018, puts obligations on users of personal information and lays down principles for its use. One principle states that information must be processed fairly and lawfully. The GDPR also gives individuals (data subjects) certain rights over the use of their personal information. This means that you are entitled to know how we intend to use any information you provide. You can then decide whether you want to give it to us.

## Data controller

Moneyfacts.co.uk Limited (company number 6615303) is the data controller. Our registered office is Moneyfacts House, 66 – 70 Thorpe Road, Norwich NR1 1BJ. To make enquiries or exercise any of your rights as set out in this Privacy Policy, please contact our Compliance Officer either by writing to the above address or emailing dataprotection@moneyfacts.co.uk.

## The information we hold

The information we hold about individuals is limited to name, email address, selected age range and your preferences for our regular email newsletters. Certain analytics tools that we use will also use your device’s IP address to track how our website is used, which can help us assess how well the site is working. This generates an individual Identifier which contains no personal information about you and we do not append your IP address to any other personal data about yourself.

If you purchase a product or service from one of our commercial partners via a link from Moneyfacts.co.uk they may pass us, or give us access to, restricted information about you so we can track any payments due to ourselves from the third party. We have minimised the amount of personal information we receive for this purpose.

## Lawful basis

Under the GDPR we can only process your personal information if there is a lawful basis for us to do so. We use either Consent or Legitimate Interests as lawful bases as follows:

  * We send our weekly newsletters and offers regarding third party services based on your consent. You will have given us your email address for this purpose. Each communication includes a link that allows you to withdraw your consent (unsubscribe) from each type of email.
  * If you ask us to pass your details to a third party with whom we have a commercial relationship, we will do so. By completing any form etc. on our website for this purpose you will be giving us your consent to do so. In most cases the forms on our website are provided by the third party so your personal information is being given directly to them.
  * If you contact us via the Contact Us section of our website we will record your personal information for record keeping and we have a legitimate interest in doing so.
  * If we receive personal information back from a third party with whom we have a commercial relationship following you dealing with them, we have a legitimate interest in processing your data, to enable us to track any commission payments due to us. We have minimised the amount of personal information we receive for this purpose.
  * If you complete an entry in our annual Moneyfacts Consumer Awards Questionnaire we will retain the information you gave us. It is in our legitimate interests to do so e.g. for data quality reasons.
  * We may send you emails regarding future Moneyfacts Consumer Awards Questionnaires based on your consent.



We will not pass your personal information to anyone outside the Moneyfacts Group unless you have asked us to or if we are required to do so by any legal order.

We will retain your personal information for record keeping purposes but will ensure that it is not kept longer than is necessary. For example, for Contact Us enquiries or for information passed to us by third parties we will keep your information for no longer than 2 years.

We do not use any automated decision making processes.

There is no statutory or contractual obligation on you to supply any personal data to us.

From time to time we offer user surveys and questionnaires to provide you with interesting insights, helpful tools, or to understand our user base more accurately. If you take part in a Moneyfacts survey which is hosted by Smart Survey, your personal information will be processed by SmartSurvey Ltd but Moneyfacts will be the Data Controller.

No information about you is processed outside of the EU.

## Data subjects rights

As a data subject, you have the following rights under the GDPR:

  * The right to access a copy of the data we hold about you. There is no fee required for this. We are required to provide the information within one month of your request;
  * The right to have your data supplied in a machine-readable format (e.g. a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet);
  * The right to withdraw any consent you have given us or object to its processing if you have grounds relating to your personal situation;
  * The right to erase or restrict the processing of the information we hold about you in certain circumstances, such as where the original purpose for the data collection is no longer relevant, where you object to the processing and we have no overriding legitimate interest in keeping it or where the data is being unlawfully processed.



## Data protection regulator

The Information Commissioner is the UK regulator for data protection issues. You have the right to complain to them about any breaches of your data protection rights.
