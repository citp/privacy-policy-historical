Privacy Policy
The Data Protection Act
Moneyfacts.co.uk Limited (company number 6615303) is the data controller. Our registered office is
Moneyfacts House, 66 – 70 Thorpe Road, Norwich NR1 1BJ. If you have any queries about this
Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at the above address.
The Data Protection Act puts obligations on users of personal information and lays down principles
for its use. One principle states that information has to be processed fairly and lawfully. This means
that you are entitled to know how we intend to use any information you provide. You can then
decide whether you want to give it to us.
If we are requested to provide any information to assist with law enforcement enquiries, we will do
so.
The information we hold:
The information we hold about individuals is limited to name, gender, email address, age and your
preferences for our regular emails.
Moneyfacts.co.uk has a number of third party relationships in place which aim to offer users the
broadest service possible. We aim to be as clear as possible about all these relationships so you
know who you are dealing with. In some cases you will provide your information direct to the third
party, and in some cases Moneyfacts.co.uk will collect your information and pass it to the third party
to fulfil your request. If you provide personal information to a third party to use their services, e.g.
via an online form, they may pass us your information, including the details of any transaction you
make. This allows us to track any introduction fees. If you have opted-in to receiving emails from
Moneyfacts.co.uk via a third party, they will pass us your name and email address. We will ensure
that your personal information is captured and passed securely at all times.
We do not hold sensitive information, but just enough to know who you are and the products you
are interested in. We will only use this for the purpose specified when you gave us your information,
and it will not be passed to any third party, other than to fulfil your request, e.g. for a call back from
an adviser.
If you place a comment on our Community Forum we will display your user name against your
comment. You can choose a user name that does not reveal your identity.


Cookie Policy
About Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer (or other device you use to access the
internet) by the websites that you visit, or companies that advertise on them. We use the term
‘cookie’ to refer to cookies and other types of file (including pixel tags), all of which are slightly
different, but do a similar function.
There are many different types of cookies, which differ in terms of how intrusive they are to your
browsing experience. You can learn about cookies and how to control them at
www.aboutcookies.org. The main types are:
        Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move
         around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.
         Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like returning search results, cannot be
         provided. These are usually placed by the website you are visiting (first party cookies) and
         will expire when you leave that website (session cookies).
        Performance Cookies – These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website,
         for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web
         pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these
         cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a
         website works. These will mainly be first party cookies, but could be set by third party
         websites. They may be session cookies or ‘persistent cookies’ that stay on your computer
         after your browsing session has finished.
        Functionality Cookies - These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make
         (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more
         personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local content by
         storing a cookie in the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be
         used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages
         that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for
         such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect
         may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. They
         may be session cookies, but will mainly be persistent cookies. Again they could be set by
         first or third parties.
        Targeting or Advertising Cookies - These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant
         to you and your interests They are also used to limit the number of times you see an
         advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They
         are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They
         remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other
         organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked
         to site functionality provided by the other organisation. This type of cookie will normally be
         set by third parties, and will almost always be persistent. They will track you as you browse
         the internet.
Moneyfacts.co.uk Use of Cookies

     to navigate through the pages and the website you visited prior to reaching our site. We use
     Google Analytics, Sessioncam, SumoMe, Visual Website Optimiser for this purpose. This
     includes advertising features which provide access to aggregated demographic information
     about website users (such as geographic location, age profile and gender). This also helps us
     measure the effectiveness of our site features, offerings, advertisements, and e-mail
     communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon), and also applies to the
     Moneyfacts Blog website and the Moneyfacts Community website. You can opt out of Google
     Analytics by clicking here and downloading the app. However, this means that the your

     We use strictly necessary cookies and performance cookies to help us identify when a user
     clicks a “Go to Site” or “Speak to an Adviser” button to apply or find out more about a product or
     service. We do this so we can show the provider how many people using Moneyfacts.co.uk
     clicked on a particular product or service to fulfil any commercial arrangement we may have in
     place. We use Google Analytics for this purpose. If we couldn’t use this type of cookie, we
     would not make any money and would be unable to offer our services; Read more about how
     we earn money. We may also use this type of cookie in blog.moneyfacts.co.uk and
     community.moneyfacts.co.uk.
     We use targeting / advertising cookies to display advertising on our site. We use cookies from
     third party websites including Doubleclick and Facebook for this purpose. When any advert is
     shown on the site, a targeting / advertising cookie may be placed on your computer. Please

     control. We may also place on you’re computer a tracking cookie from Captify Media Limited

     this purpose process only the search terms you use and technical information relating to your
     PC. Users may prevent Captify cookies from being set on their devices at

     allows us to identify whether the email has been opened. This does not include any personal
     information about you.

we have no control over. Please refer to their cookie policy for full details.

the web to maximise the efficiency of marketing campaigns. We have no control over these
cookies. Examples of these cookies include:

normally apply to pixel tags and the other file types). The Help portion of the toolbar on most
browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies (including those
from specific websites), how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how


to disable non-essential types of cookies. However, this may mean that not all of the functions of
the site will be available to you.

place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or collect personal information
