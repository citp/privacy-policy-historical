**What personal data we collect and why we collect it**

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <https://automattic.com/privacy/>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

The information we collect is gathered from several sources, which include product subscriptions, purchases, contest entries, readers poll voting, or registrations, either from print or online forms; website message postings; and survey information and direct or indirect purchases via telephone, direct mail, email, or other electronic sources. From these sources we may collect postal addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and/or demographic information for those individuals that volunteer such information. For each visitor to our websites, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name and IP address only. No other identifiable information is collected unless volunteered. In addition, we collect aggregate information on what Web pages visitors visit.

Moderndrummer.com uses Google Analytics to measure page views and traffic. Google Analytics saves user’s IP Address for 26 months. If you enter any of our contests, you will need to enter your name, address, email address, and phone number.
