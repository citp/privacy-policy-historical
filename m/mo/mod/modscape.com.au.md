## Website Privacy Policy

Modscape Holdings Pty Ltd (ABN: 31617645182) and associated entities of 430 Francis St, Brooklyn, Victoria 3012, Australia (“Modscape”) is committed to upholding the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012. We recognise the importance of privacy and community awareness regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information which we may collect during the course of our functions. This Privacy Policy sets out how we manage your personal information and protect your privacy.

We may keep copies of the above documents (in physical or electronic form at our discretion) as is necessary to provide our services. All personal information is securely stored at all times by us or an authorised external service provider and only authorised people will have access to the above documents and information. Personal information we collect will not be disclosed overseas.

## 3\. Why we collect and hold personal information

We may collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for purposes necessary to carry out our services. Generally, these purposes include:

  * to keep in contact with you and inform you of our work (including providing you with our newsletter, if subscribed);
  * to provide you with the services requested by you from us;
  * for general marketing and promotional purposes;
  * to comply with our reporting obligations to the Australian Taxation Office and other government agencies and public sector bodies;

  * for research and development.



We are committed to maintaining your privacy and we will only use your personal information for a permitted purpose for which we have collected the information.

You have the option of not identifying yourself or using a pseudonym when dealing with us, unless we believe it is impracticable to do so in the circumstances. If you wish to deal with us in this manner, you must tell us in writing so that we can consider if your request is practicable.

## 4\. How we may share your information

If necessary to provide our services, we may need to disclose your personal information to external service providers (such as information technology service providers, legal service providers, mailing houses etc.). These external service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than the purpose for which you have given us your personal information. Otherwise, we will only share your personal information in accordance with your express consent and instructions, as provided through the exclusions set out in the Australian Privacy Principles. We do not supply our database information to other marketing organisations not acting on our behalf.

There is no application fee for making a request to access your personal information.

These costs will not be excessive.
