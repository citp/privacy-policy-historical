</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One of the primary purposes 
of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.  
For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, 
a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">MODEL MAYHEM reserves the right 
to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does

<b>Use of Web Beacons or GIF files</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">MODEL MAYHEM.com Web pages 
may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes also 
called single-pixel gifs - that allow MODEL MAYHEM to count users who 
have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.  MODEL 
MAYHEM may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters 
in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some of these Web beacons may 
be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness 
of our advertising campaigns or email communications.  These Web 
beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent 
cookie on your computer.  This allows the service provider to recognize 
your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile 
anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn 
enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and 
emails bring you to our website and how you use the site.  MODEL 
MAYHEM prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your 
personal information.</font> <br></p>
