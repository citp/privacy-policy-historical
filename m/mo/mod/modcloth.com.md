Any feedback you provide shall be non-confidential and non-proprietary.

Referral Program

ModCloth may offer you the opportunity to earn referral rewards by referring friends to join. Those rewards may be awarded to the referrer for qualified referrals that result in new ModCloth members who make at least one qualified purchase. Referral rewards are not property, have no cash value, and can only be used in connection with making a qualified purchase on the Site. Referral rewards are not transferable, assignable, or sellable. They are not gift certificates, they cannot be used to purchase gift certificates, and they cannot be obtained by purchasing gift certificates. Referral rewards expire six (6) months after they are granted.  ModCloth reserves the right to revoke referral rewards if we determine that you have engaged in fraudulent referral activity (e.g., inviting yourself to join with a fake email address, using spam to obtain referrals, or acquiring referrals through unsolicited email to persons unknown to you), if you have otherwise violated our referral program terms, or if you have violated the Site’s Terms of Use.

Referral rewards are granted at ModCloth’s sole discretion. We reserve the right to amend these guidelines and the methods through which referral rewards are earned at any time without notice to you. For more information about the referral program, please review the full Terms and Conditions at <http://www.modcloth.com/help/terms-of-use/modcloth-referral-program-terms>.
