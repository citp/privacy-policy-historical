# Privacy Policy - Mod DB - Mod DB

Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains our approach to privacy on all our [DBolical Pty Ltd](http://www.dbolical.com/) ("DBolical") websites and how it affects you.

## The Information We Collect

When you sign up for any of our services – paid or otherwise – we will record specific personal information about you, such as your name and email address. We will also collect and store information about your use of our services so as to improve them. For example, we keep a log of what features are being used at any time.

## The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. You can register with our website if you would like to receive updates on our new products and services.

## Measuring our visitors

We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that _somebody_ visited our site. The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better. You can learn more about [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html "Google Analytics' privacy policy") or [opt out if you wish](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout "How to opt out of google analytics").

## Disclosing Information

We use non-identifying aggregated information to better design our website for our advertisers and publishers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women brought games, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

## Cookies

Your Internet browser has the in-built facility for storing small files "cookies" that hold information which allows a website to recognise your account. Our website takes advantage of this facility to enhance your experience. You have the ability to prevent your computer from accepting cookies but, if you do, certain functionality on the website may be impaired.

## Third Party

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

## Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. All financial transactions are protected by 256bit SSL encryption and no credit card numbers or CVV data is stored.

## Our Commitment To Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## How You Can Remove Your Information

You can [contact us](http://www.moddb.com/contact) if you would like your account closed. Once we have verified your identity, we can remove all your personal details and IP on request.

## Any questions?

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please [contact us](http://www.moddb.com/contact).
