## Browser and encryption FAQs

  * What is encryption and why do I need it?
  * What else is required to use this site?
  * Why can't I access any secure pages on the Moda Health website with Internet Explorer?



What is encryption and why do I need it?

Changes in federal law are affecting requirements to ensure that member information is kept confidential and the transmission of that information is secure over the Internet. To comply with the current requirements for transmission over the Internet, the browser you use must be capable of supporting encryption and de-encryption.

Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format for transmission. Encryption scrambles data that is sent from Moda Health to you. Your browser must be capable of decrypting, or unscrambling, the data. To do this, you will need a 128-bit-capable browser. 

Browsers with 128-bit encryption provide the best protection when transmitting confidential data over the Internet. You must update your browser to 128-bit encryption or you will not be able to use some areas of the Moda Health website.
