We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact with the content, products and services on this site (the Website). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. It does not apply to other websites to which we link. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree that your use of the Site signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
<div class="ter_tital"><span><strong>1. Information Collected</strong></span>
<p><strong>We collect two types of information from you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>information that you voluntarily provide to us&nbsp;(e.g. through a voluntary registration process, sign-ups or emails); and</li>
<li>information that is derived through automated tracking mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<span><strong>Voluntary Registration Information.</strong></span><br>
<p>In order to fully access this Site, you must first complete the registration process, during which we will collect personal information about you. The information will include your name, address, email address<em>,&nbsp;</em>and birthday. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide such information to us on a voluntary basis.&nbsp;<br>By registering with us, you consent to the use and method of disclosure as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<span><strong>Voluntary Information for Services and Features</strong></span><br>
<p>We [also] collect personally identifiable information when you choose to use certain other features of the Site, including: i) making purchases, ii) consenting to receive email or text messages about upcoming promotions or events, iii) consenting to receive email, iv) participating in our message boards, iv) commenting on photos, videos, music, and others.

<span><strong>Cookies&nbsp;</strong></span><br>
<p>Our site uses "cookies" and other tracking technologies. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user's system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.</p>
<p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Site.</p>
<p>Third-Party Cookies: In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p>
