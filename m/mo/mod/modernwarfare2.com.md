Personal information collected during registration includes your first and last name, email address and username. This personal information is combined with other Information such as your date of birth, country and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs and services and marketing preferences. Additionally, we will collect and may combine Information when you link a third party account (e.g., XBOX Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam) to your Activision account, and the use of certain Properties may require you to link a third party account to your Activision account. With an Activision account you may enjoy a tailored service and support across the Properties such as the community portals, email newsletters and the games you love and enjoy. 

**B. Use of Our Properties  
**When you visit or use our Properties we may collect, process and/or combine Information about your use of those Properties, such as websites you visited before and after you used a Property, browser type and language, IP address, hardware and software information, third party account information (e.g., the username associated with your XBOX Live, PlayStation Network, or Steam account), gameplay data, purchase histories, and Social Media data. We may use Cookies and/or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “ **Cookies** ”) to do this.  In addition, we or our partners may also use Cookies to serve ads in our Properties. Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/cookie-policy) for more details.

Activision may collect, process, and combine data such as your age, gender, interests, name, email address, gameplay, marketing preferences, customer service, and device-related information.

Activision may also publicly display certain Information about you, including third party account information and gameplay information, on the Properties. For example, your PlayStation gamertag will be displayed on leaderboards if you are a top player in a certain Activision game, regardless of whether or not you have an Activision account. If you have synced a third party account with your Activision account, your gamertag may be made available to be searched by other users if you have not opted out of this feature. You may unlink the third party account or prevent it from being searched at any time through your Activision profile settings.

From time to time, Activision may offer you the ability to email or message friends or family by using our "send-a-friend" tool. In the event we offer you this ability, we delete both sender and recipient email addresses after sending the message and only use the information we collect for the purpose of sending the email or message (unless we have separately collected the sender or recipient's details for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy). In using our "send-a-friend" tool, you confirm that you and the recipient know each other and that you have their consent to send them an email.

**Vendors**  
Vendors provide goods and services (for example, billing, consumer services support, consultancy, information technology hardware and software) to Activision in order to support, operate and develop the Properties and to deliver marketing communications on our behalf. We do not share Information with vendors to use for their own direct marketing purposes or any other purpose without your consent, except those outlined above and to execute, deliver and/or improve the services they provide.

**Law**  
We will disclose your Information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. 

This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.

**Legal Rights

**7\. Security**  
Activision takes a range of security measures designed to help protect your Information. However, complete online and offline security can never be guaranteed, so you should always take care when sharing your information online.

Click here for details Hide details

Activision takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, and scores, etc.). We also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration. In addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information. However, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks. The complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.
