## What security measures do we employ for information about you collected through the Service or this Site?

Security is very important to us – we encourage you to [read our security documentation.](https://web.archive.org/security/connector-security.html)

To help protect the privacy of data we collect through the Service, we employ measures intended to be consistent with industry best practices for security and encryption in data transmission and storage. However, you should keep in mind that the Site and the Service are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.

Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this Privacy Policy, no data transmission over the Internet or encryption method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## How can you correct, update or make choices regarding the information about you that is stored by Mode?

You may correct or update information that we collect about you by managing your account on the Service in the [Settings section.](https://modeanalytics.com/settings) This includes the addition or removal of personal information (except your name, email address, username and password, which we require of all users to maintain their accounts), as well as preferences for the types of communications you receive from us. 

For our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement. In addition, we are not responsible for updating or removing any information about you collected through the Site or the Service already disclosed to third parties who have been provided information as described in this Privacy Policy.

At this time, Mode does not support “Do Not Track” preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, the Service and the Site are not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set. For more information about Do Not Track, visit donottrack.us.

## What are the policies of linked websites and other third parties?

You should be aware that when you are using the Site or the Service, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control or be interfacing with third-party integrated services. We would expect most, if not all, of these third parties will collect information about you when you use their offerings. However, Mode is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, regardless whether they are linked or otherwise connected to this Site or the Service. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy whenever interacting with any third-party website or other offering.

The Service and this Site are not directed to children under 13. If you learn that your minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us.

You also agree to abide by any limitation on damages contained in our Terms of Service or other agreement that we have with you.

## What are the terms regarding any future changes to this Privacy Policy?
