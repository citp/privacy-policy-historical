# ModeSens Privacy Policy

Voguery Group, Inc. (“Voguery Group”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This notice describes Voguery Group’s privacy policy for our web site (the “Site”) including all online services and functions associated with the Site (the “Services”).

You must register on this Site in order to use certain of the Site’s online services and functions, such as our blogs. If you just want to browse the Site, registration is optional.

During registration, you will be required to provide contact information, consisting of an email address and password.

You can select any username you want, except that your username cannot be an impersonation, the same or confusingly similar to a famous trademark, or be a term that is offensive in any way. You may, but are not obligated to, use your own name. If you do use your own name, you consent to it being passed to others by use of the functions of the Site. Voguery Group reserves the right to reject or remove any username that does not meet applicable standards.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Voguery Group use cookies on the Site.

Voguery Group uses both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Voguery Group uses session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. If you check “remember me on this computer” when logging in to the Site, Voguery Group also sets a persistent cookie to store your username passwords, so you do not have to enter it more than once. The persistent cookie also enables Voguery Group to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the Site. The persistent cookie is removed when you uncheck the “remember my email address” check box.

Your web browser allows you to control and limit cookies on your computer. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas or functions of the Site may be limited.

Some of Voguery Group’s business partners (such as advertisers) use cookies on the Site. Voguery Group has no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Voguery Group only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Voguery Group’s business partners.

Voguery Group may use social plugins on the Services, for instance plugins of the social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest and Tumblr, and may feature icons, like the “thumbs up” icon or text like “Recommend”, “Like” or “Comment”. Your browser may create a connection to the servers of such social networks and/or transmit data to such servers when you view a page on the Site. If you use the plugin functionality (e.g. click the “Like” button or make a comment), this information is also transmitted directly to the social network by your browser and may be stored there. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of these third party social networks.

Voguery Group may use your username and email address to provide you with email newsletters and announcements.

This Site may request additional information from you on product order forms or other online transaction forms. Such forms may require you to provide contact information (such as name and mailing or shipping address) and payment information (such as credit card number and credit card expiration date). Information that you provide in this way may be used for billing and accounting purposes, for recording products and services that you have licensed, bought or downloaded, and to fill your orders. Voguery Group may use this contact information to communicate about orders, products, services, or fees or charges.

Voguery Group may partner with other third parties to provide specific goods or services. When you sign up for such goods or services, Voguery Group will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these goods or services. Voguery Group does not authorize third party providers to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose related to these goods or services.

Voguery Group may share your information in other circumstances with your consent, for example when you have chosen to link an account with the Services with a social media network like Facebook.

The Site may allow you to contribute to one or more blogs or communicate by means of online functions.

Nothing requires you to disclose your identity to others. If you choose to disclose your identity to third parties using any Site function or service, you do so at your own risk. Voguery Group is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information, personal or otherwise, that you may choose to communicate or exchange using the functionality of the Site.

In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets.

Voguery Group will make reasonable effort to provide notice on the Site and to notify you via email to the most recent email address that you have provided to Voguery Group of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

Voguery Group may release information concerning your use of Voguery Group (including, but not limited to, posted Public Content, registration information, and network records) when it believes in good faith that such release is appropriate to comply with the law (for example, pursuant to a statutory demand, subpoena, warrant or court order), to protect against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of the Voguery Group, to protect Voguery Group's rights or property, enforce any contract between you and Voguery Group, or if Voguery Group reasonably believes that a situation involving danger of death or injury to any person requires disclosure.

Voguery Group does not intend to sell, share, or rent information obtained on this Site other than as discussed in this privacy policy.

If Voguery Group decides to change its privacy policy, Voguery Group will post those changes on Voguery Group’s Site so Voguery Group’s users can remain aware of what information Voguery Group collects, how Voguery Group uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, Voguery Group discloses it.

Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the Company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes and a disclosure of the shared information. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that provides you with an “opt-out” choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the Company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

This Site qualifies for the alternative option. Its privacy policy provides you with information on how you may opt-out from the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, send a request to the following email address: [info@modesens.com](https://web.archive.org/%22mailto:info@modesens.com/%22).
