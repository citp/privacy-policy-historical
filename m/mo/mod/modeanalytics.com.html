        <h4>Third-Party Integrated Services</h4>
        <p>We may implement certain third-party offerings in the Service, enabling such third parties to collect information about you through your use of the Service.

      <div class="block">
        <h2>To whom does Mode disclose information about you that we collect through the Service?</h2>
        <p>We may disclose personal or other information collected about you through the Service or this Site either (i) when we have your permission or (ii) in any of the following situations without your permission:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>We may disclose information that we collect about you to our affiliates, and to third-party contractors who perform services for Mode in connection with the Site and/or the Service or to complete or confirm a transaction that you conduct with us.</li>
          <li>As noted, information about you collected by third-party services integrated with the Site or the Service will be disclosed to such third parties.</li>
          <li>We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you and other users without restriction. In these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.</li>
          <li>We may disclose information about you as part of a merger, acquisition or other sale or transfer of all or substantially all of Mode’s assets or business. We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
          <li>We may disclose information about you to the government or to third parties under certain circumstances when legally obligated to do so, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity in connection with the Service or this Site, or to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process. We reserve the right to release information collected through the Service or this Site to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.</li>
          <li>We may disclose any information that we believe is necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mode, our employees, our users, or others.</li>
          <li>If you use the Site or the Service outside of the United States, information that we collect about you will be transferred to servers inside the United States and maintained indefinitely, which may involve the transfer of information out of countries located in the European Economic Area.

      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>What security measures do we employ for information about you collected through the Service or this Site?</h2>
        <p>
          Security is very important to us – we encourage you to
          <a href="/security/connector-security.html">read our security documentation.</a>
        </p>
        <p>To help protect the privacy of data we collect through the Service, we employ measures intended to be consistent with industry best practices for security and encryption in data transmission and storage. However, you should keep in mind that the Site and the Service are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.</p>
        <p>Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this Privacy Policy, no data transmission over the Internet or encryption method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>How can you correct, update or make choices regarding the information about you that is stored by Mode?</h2>
        <p>
          You may correct or update information that we collect about you by managing your account on the Service in the
          <a href="https://modeanalytics.com/settings">Settings section.</a>
          This includes the addition or removal of personal information (except your name, email address, username and password, which we require of all users to maintain their accounts), as well as preferences for the types of communications you receive from us.
        </p>
        <p>For our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement.  In addition, we are not responsible for updating or removing any information about you collected through the Site or the Service already disclosed to third parties who have been provided information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>At this time, Mode does not support “Do Not Track” preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, the Service and the Site are not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set. For more information about Do Not Track, visit donottrack.us.</p>

      <div class="block">
        <h2>What are the policies of linked websites and other third parties?</h2>

You should be aware that when you are using the Site or the Service, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control or be interfacing with third-party integrated services. We would expect most, if not all, of these third parties will collect information about you when you use their offerings. However, Mode is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, regardless whether they are linked or otherwise connected to this Site or the Service. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy whenever interacting with any third-party website or other offering.</p>
