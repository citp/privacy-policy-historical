Privacy Policy

**MODERNHEALTHCARE.COM**

ModernHealthcare.com is a Web site of _Modern Healthcare_ , a business unit of Crain Communications Inc. Our postal address is 360 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, Illinois, 60601. We can be reached by e-mail at [mheditorial@crain.com](mailto:mheditorial@modernhealthcare.com) or by telephone at 312-649-3173. 

_Modern Healthcare_ has developed this Privacy Policy to advise site users of our possible uses of information collected during a modernhealthcare.com visit. 

When you register, make purchases or at other times, we collect and store personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, postal and e-mail addresses, credit card information, facts about your profession and information regarding your computer system. For each visitor to modernhealthcare.com, our web server may automatically attempt to identify the user through a cookie set within your browser. This is done to provide access to the site. From time to time we may also track information, in aggregate, on pages and features that subscribers access or view. The activity is collected and stored in our server's log files. We may also set cookies to your computer to allow subscribers to store login information, set personalization and navigate easily through the site. 

We may conduct online surveys and contests or generate content that is presented by aggregating activity of users on the site. These surveys and contests are entirely voluntary and you may decline to participate. 

Information collected about users may be used by _Modern Healthcare_ (and our affiliates and partnering third-party companies) to provide users with the features of the site, to enable us to provide the products you requested, to personalize content and advertising to users, to send you e-mail notifications about our services and products, for audits, to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (such as for product development purposes), to enforce our user agreement and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We will disclose site usage information to third parties only in aggregate. 

From time to time, we may make individual user information available to carefully selected third parties to send you information through e-mail or postal mail about their products or services. During the registration process, a user can indicate on the registration form that he or she does not wish to receive such marketing materials via e-mail or postal mail. Additionally, a user can indicate that he or she does not want to receive news about new site features or marketing materials from _Modern Healthcare_ via e-mail. _Modern Healthcare_ retains the right to contact a registered user regarding account status or changes to the registration agreement. 

_Modern Healthcare_ will remove any registrant (and their personal information) from our database pursuant to a request from the registrant, including full name and e-mail address, to [lkeener@crain.com](mailto:lkeener@crain.com?subject=RemoveMyInformationFromModernHealthcareDatabase), or allow any registrant to "opt out" of further contact or change/correct personal information online. You may not be able to fully access modernhealthcare.com if you request removal of your personal information. 

If you provided your postal mail address during registration and do not wish to receive marketing mailings from _Modern Healthcare_ and affiliates, you may remove your name by sending an e-mail [lkeener@crain.com](mailto:lkeener@crain.com?subject=DoNotMail) with "Do Not Mail" in the subject line along with your full name or by calling us at 312-649-5452.
