# Modern Dog Privacy Policy | Modern Dog magazine

Modern Dog Inc. ("Modern Dog") is committed to safeguarding the privacy of all visitors and customers when interacting with any of our communication outlets, such as the website, e-newsletters, digital and print subscriptions, and contests. This privacy policy provides details to you, the user, as to how we collect data and how we use that data to improve your experiences when interacting with us.

By using the Modern Dog website, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy and consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy. We do reserve the right, without prior notice, to modify our Privacy Policy as business needs require. 

**Collection of Personal Data**  
Modern Dog collects personal data, meaning any information relating to the identity of any individual, when you:  

  * Subscribe to the publications (print and digital);
  * Download and register to read any additional content such as e-books;
  * Subscribe to e-newsletters or participate in any type of online forum;
  * Submit content in any form to be used in our publications, newsletters, on the website, or on Modern Dog’s social media channels
  * Enter any contests, giveaways or promotions
  * Participate in any surveys
  * Contact customer service representatives
  * Apply for a career opportunity



We do require some personal data in order to participate in these above services. If you do not wish to provide such data, you may opt-out at any time; however, you will be limited to what services are available to you. 

Below, you will find comprehensive examples of where and how we collect your personal data. Unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the data we collect may be used for any purpose set forth in "How We Use the Information We Collect" below.

**_Subscriptions:_**  When you subscribe to Modern Dog, we ask you to provide your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and credit card or other payment information for the purposes of fulfilling your subscription, sending you invoices, contacting you about the expiry of your subscription, and sending you service messages about your subscription. Once you are subscribed, we may store your subscription information, including its start date, renewal date, pricing, publications, and any customer service contacts you may have with us.

**_Online Registration:_**  You do not have to register to browse some areas of our websites. However, registration may be required to receive online newsletters or to participate in certain website features, such as contests, giveaways, memorials, and community forums. When you register, you will be asked for personal data such as your name, e-mail address, and a user name and password that you select. We collect this information to identify who you are, to provide you with the service or information you requested, and/or to facilitate your participation in a contest, on-line forum or community. We may also use this information for other purposes, such as promotional and marketing purposes, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and not in violation of applicable law.

Please remember that any information you disclose in some of these contests, public forums or community areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible to other users, so it is important for you to carefully consider what, if any, personal data you reveal in these areas. We may use information disclosed by you in this way to promote our products and services in our advertising communications, among other things.

**_Information based on a referral:_**  On our website and through certain promotions, you can submit personal data about other people. For example, if you order a gift subscription and want it sent directly to the recipient, you would be required to submit the recipient's name and address. We do not use the recipient's personal data for any other purpose unless this is consistent with any further dealings which we may have with the recipient directly. 

**_Promotions or Surveys:_**  When you enter a contest or promotion or participate in a survey or poll we may ask you to provide your name, address, phone number, and email address. We use the information we collect on promotion entry forms to administer your participation in the promotions and for other purposes stated on the entry form. Our surveys ask for opinions on various issues and may be sponsored by our advertisers and partners. Information obtained through surveys is aggregated and used internally. We also share survey information with advertisers and marketing partners in an aggregated form that does not personally identify you. In the event personal information is requested as part of a survey, such personal information will only be provided to unaffiliated third parties if you have given consent.

**_Optional Information:_**  Occasionally, we may request demographic information (age or gender) or information about your interests (pets, age, breed) and purchasing preferences. In most instances, you do not have to provide us with this information to receive the publications, product, or service you have requested. When demographic information is required, it will be indicated, such as by an asterisk (*). We use this demographic and preference information to, among other things, tailor or improve our messaging, publications, product and service offerings, including our offerings to you where this is in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as well as for internal marketing research purposes.

**_Customer Service:_  **When you call one of our customer service representatives, or email us with a comment or question, you may be asked for information that identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, account number, postal or zip code, and telephone number, to help us promptly answer your question. We retain this information as necessary to assist you in the future, for instance with any further queries you may have. We also use your feedback, suggestions and comments to monitor and/or improve our messaging, publications, product offerings, and Services, among other things.

**_Website Information:_**  We collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our website, as well as clickstream and other related information, such as information about your computer or device, web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to our site, the pages, content or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download, the next website you visit when you leave our site, and any search terms you have entered on our site. We use this information to monitor and improve our Services, among other things.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
 ** _Cookies:  _**We use cookies, which we place on your device to help enhance your user experience across all our platforms. Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer or device to store your preferences. Other information you provide to us may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your Web browser or device and may enable us to recognize you as the same user who has used our Services and relate your use of the Services to other information about you. 

We use cookies (as well as Local Shared Objects, HTML5, cache cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs, all described further below) to understand usage of the Services and to improve our content and offerings and to deliver advertisements that you might be interested in.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. However, you may find that some parts of the site will not function properly if you have refused cookies or similar tracking technologies and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar tracking technologies might prevent you from accessing some of our content. Your viewing of editorial content may be hampered. If you wish to block cookies, go to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/> to find out how, or check your browser’s instructions.

A web beacon is an electronic image called a single-pixel or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as a user's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and description of the page where the web beacon is placed. These web beacons may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy above.

**_Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information:  _**Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location. Some mobile device IDs are persistent, while others may be resettable by accessing the device’s privacy settings. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, as well as other information about your device, including without limitation, your wireless carrier, the make, model, operating system, capacity and settings of your device, the names, package IDs and versions of other software you have downloaded to your device and information about how you interact with and navigate within our Service.

**Third Party Websites, Social Media, and Advertisers**

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, loss, modification, disclosure, and any form of unlawful processing of personal data in our custody and control, and our service providers are bound to maintain similar safeguards. These measures also aim at preventing unnecessary collection and further processing of personal data. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard the personal data in our custody and control, and we require similar safeguarding measures from our service providers, we need you to understand that we are unable to guarantee the security of your personal data.

To provide you with an increased level of security online, access to your personal data on certain of our websites may be protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication.
