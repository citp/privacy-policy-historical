Provides a privacy notice and/or a link to this Privacy Statement on all pages that ask for personal information  


**How we use the information we collect** :

If we do release your information to a third party, for example to sign you up for a third party service provided through MODELS.com that you have specifically requested, a link to the third party's privacy notice and terms of service will be displayed at the time you are offered the option to release this information. These third parties currently include Emazing and PhotoChannel. Links to third party company privacy policies are provided below in the section entitled "The Way We Use Information". 

BUT please note that MODELS.com may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) MODELS.com's rights or property, other MODELS.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. MODELS.com may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or provide that service. In cases in which we need to share the information with a third party to fulfill an order or provide a service, we will always inform you before sharing this information with these third parties, state how the information will be used by the third party by linking to their privacy statement and offer you the option to refuse to use the third party's services or products.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

We use your portfolio statistics information to enable autorized modeling agencies using our online scouting service to search through our database of members. This information is never tied to any personal identifying information about you during the search except for your first name, initial of last name, photographs and your general location (State + Country.) When an agency contacts you through our scouting system you can accept or decline to respond. If you do not respond the agency will not have access to any additional personal identifying information about you. If you accept, only the information you voluntarily disclose will be available to the agency.

You may also opt-in to display some of you personal information (email address and detailed location info) on the MODELS.com Member Forums, the default setting if you do not opt-in will not display any information on the forums except for your MODELS.com username, country, occupation and interests.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**   
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.   


**ADVERTISERS ON MODELS.COM**  
All users accessing the MODELS.com Web site, and viewing advertisements on MODELS.com's Web pages, retain complete anonymity where MODELS.com is concerned. As ads are delivered, MODELS.com does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. MODELS.com does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. MODELS.com servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of MODELS.com advertising clients and customers. 

**The Cookie Principle**  
MODELS.com may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you first access a MODELS.com Web page with or without an ad on it, MODELS.com or its advertising client may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to measure the popularity of the different sections of the site, and to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute or which articles on the site are more popular. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over and can also help us improve the MODELS.com Web site content and features based on users's actual usage of the site - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience. If you refuse a cookie, you can still use MODELS.com but your experience may differ from those individuals using cookies.

**3rd Party Measurement Services**  
Often, advertisers will employ a third-party measurement service other than MODELS.com for tracking the performance of an ad program. In these instances, MODELS.com has no control over the information collected by the third party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third party measurement service where collected information is concerned. If you have questions regarding different third party measurement services and their respective methods of information collection, please contact feedback@models.com. 

MODELS.com uses BurstMedia for advertising banner sales displayed on the MODELS.com site. A link to BurstMedia's privacy policy is included below for your information:  
<http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp>

**Disclosure**  
MODELS.com openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to [feedback@models.com](mailto:feedback@models.com). 

MODELS.com reserves the right to amend this Privacy Statement at any time without notice, and only the current Privacy Statement may be deemed effective. Regardless of later updates or changes to our privacy notice, we will never use the information you submit under our current privacy notice in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use.  
This Privacy notice was last updated on January 31st 2001 and is deemed effective as of this date.
