                        <li>
                            <a>What information do we collect from you?</a>
                            <div>
                                <p>In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: (1) Personally Identifiable Information and (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this site as listed below in #2 (collection of information), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, employer, profile password, telephone numbers, date of birth, and other personal identifying information. When ordering products or services on the site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you go to next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.</p>

                                <p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you, unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You generally provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you participate in the following:</p>
<p>We will request information from you when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register on our site, including providing your email address</li>
<li>Plan a trip to Mammoth Mountain Ski Area or any of its related operations</li>
<li>Place an order with Mammoth Mountain</li>
<li>Provide feedback or participate in an online survey</li>
<li>Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer by us or one of our marketing, sponsorship, or service partners</li>
<li>Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list</li>
<li>Create your online guest profile</li>
<li>Participate in loyalty or club card programs</li>
<li>Purchase specific services such as rentals, lessons, and lodging</li>
<li>Sign up for special offers from selected third parties</li>
<li>Send email messages, submit forms, or transmit other information by telephone or letter</li>
<li>Submit your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on or through our site</li>
<li>We may also collect information from you at other points on our site that state such information is being collected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we may collect data to better understand your preferences. This information allows us to improve our products and services, and to offer you specially tailored deals when appropriate.</p>
<p>We may ask for an age or birth date when applicable for guest identification and pricing purposes (for instance, children and seniors qualify for discounts on lift tickets) and when creating your online guest profile.</p>
<p>We may also collect certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer and maintain our site, and to gather demographic information</p>
<p>We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, as required by our agreements with you. We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our site, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use, Sales Terms and Conditions, and this Private Policy.</p>

                                <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others. We do provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, marketing and sponsorship partners, and other third parties. We and our service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our sites and to deliver their services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this site; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us provide customer service.</p>
<p>We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.</p>
<p>Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement, judicial process, or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities or agencies. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
<p>We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customer sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.</p>

                                <p>We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services.
