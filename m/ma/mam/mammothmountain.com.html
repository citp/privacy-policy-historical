We take great pride in the relationships we have developed with our guests and we are committed to treating personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. This <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span> (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>” or “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Policy</span>”) is designed to inform you about our privacy policies and practices. This <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span> is part of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span> published on our Sites. Click <span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span> to review the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span>.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of the Privacy Policy</span></p> <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span> applies to the personal information we collect when you visit any Mammoth Resorts web site where the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span> is posted (our “Sites”). When we use the term “personal information,” we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, e-mail addresses, and telephone number. When other information (such as consumer preferences or demographic information) is directly associated with personal information, this other information is treated as personal information.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consent to the Policy</span></p> <p>By visiting any of our Sites, you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>. If you do not consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>, you should not use our Sites.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Territoriality</span></p> <p>Regardless of where our servers are located, your personal data will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may or may not be to the same level of protection as in other parts of the world.&nbsp; BY VISITING OUR SITES, YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING IN THE UNITED STATES OF ANY PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED OR OBTAINED BY MAMMOTH RESORTS THROUGH VOLUNTARY SUBMISSIONS, AND THAT UNITED STATES LAW GOVERNS ANY SUCH COLLECTION AND PROCESSING.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It</span></p> <p>We collect the following types of personal information through our Sites:</p> <p><em>Information You Actively Provide.</em></p> <p>We collect the personal information you actively provide when you use one of our Sites. We use the personal information you provide to deliver the programs, products and services that you request, or to process purchases or reservations you have made on our Sites. For example, we use the information you provide when you make a reservation to reserve the type of room you requested at the hotel or resort you selected. If you join any program we offer, such as a loyalty program, we use your personal information to administer the program. Information you provide to us on our Sites will be stored in an online profile we create for you, to enable us to better meet your needs and understand your preferences.</p> <p>Depending on your privacy preferences, we may use your personal information to send you promotional messages and special offers, via email, text/SMS, telephone call, and pre-recorded automated telephone message. We also use your personal information for security and fraud prevention purposes; to better understand our guests; to improve our programs, services, and Sites; and to better market and advertise our programs and services.</p> <p>At some of our Sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift, gift card, or gift certificate online and want to send it directly to the recipient, you must submit the recipient’s name and address. We use this information only to send your gift or provide the service requested. We will not add that person’s information to our mailing lists.</p> <p>We may combine information you have provided to us on our Sites with information you have provided to us offline, and we may store this information together in your online profile. For example, we may combine data automatically collected when you use your season ski pass at one of our resorts or data you provide to us when you stay at one of our hotels with your online profile. This enables us to better understand and meet your needs when you visit our resorts or other properties.</p> <p><em>Information Provided by Others.</em></p> <p>From time to time, we may supplement the information you give us with information from third parties. For example, we may supplement your profile with demographic and preference data or we may correct mailing addresses by using public sources. By supplementing your profile, we are better able to provide product recommendations and special offers that will be of genuine interest to you. We may also use this information to further personalize our Sites and improve your experience while you are on our Sites.</p> <p><em>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.</em></p> <p>We collect information that is automatically sent to us by your web browser. This information typically includes your IP address; the name and version of your operating system; the name and version of your browser; the page you were visiting before you accessed our Site; and the date and time of your visit. The information we receive depends on the settings of your browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. Generally, we use this information to create statistics that help us improve our Sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. This information is also used for marketing purposes and to improve your experience on the Sites.</p> <p>We may collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report traffic data to our corporate partners, and to audit the use of our Sites. Although the information provided by your browser does not identify you personally, this data can be combined with other data to personally identify you.</p> <p><em>Cookies.</em></p> <p>We also use "cookies" as a method to gain dependable and consistent traffic data. A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help us provide customizable services and to allow you to sign-in to our Sites. Cookies may also be used by Mammoth Resorts corporate partners on co-branded Web pages. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Sites and other Web sites may be diminished and some features will not work as intended.</p> <p><em>Advertising Servers.</em></p> <p>We may hire other companies to place our banner ads on other websites. Those companies may perform tracking and reporting activities on the ads they serve for us, as well as user reaction. They would not collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviors associated with those IP addresses on our behalf, and we will not give any personal information to them. Third-party advertising servers are subject to their own privacy policies. Our service providers are bound by contract to keep your personal information confidential and use it only to perform services on our behalf.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclosure of Your Personal Information</span></p> <p>Mammoth Resorts does not sell your personal information to outside marketers or advertisers. Under limited circumstances we may disclose the personal information we collect with outside parties for specific purposes. Those circumstances are described below along with some of the steps we take to limit the manner in which your personal information is used.</p> <p>We may share your information with companies that provide support services to us (such as credit card processors, mailing houses, web hosts, or providers of online reservation services) or that help us market our products and services (such as email vendors). These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are only authorized to use the personal information we share with them for the purpose of delivering the service we hire them to provide. In addition, we only disclose the information they need to provide the specific service or function. We will not sell your personal information to third party marketing or advertising firms.</p> <p>Personal information collected on any of the Sites may also be shared with other members of the Mammoth Resorts family of businesses, including current or future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and entities sharing common ownership with Mammoth Resorts. All of the Mammoth Resorts entities with whom we share your personal information will be bound to this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We may occasionally feature web pages on which you can register for special promotions or services provided in conjunction with our business partners. When we feature pages like these on our Sites, we will give you a clear notice that you are providing information to another party. We may also arrange to send you marketing and promotional information of other reputable companies that we think might be of interest to you, only if you tell us that you want to receive these sorts of materials. We do not share your personal information with these companies.</p> <p>If some or all of the business assets of one of our companies or Sites are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding information regarding our guests and customers to the acquiring business so that they can continue to operate the business, but your information would remain subject to this Policy.</p> <p>In certain special cases, we may disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, Mammoth Resorts or someone else. We may also disclose your personal information when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case, administrative investigation or investigation conducted by Mammoth Resorts.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Links to Third-Party Websites</span></p> <p>Our Sites contain direct links to sites offered by third parties. Some of these sites are authorized to use Mammoth Resorts brands or logos. Those third-party sites are not covered by this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>.</p> <p>Some of the Sites may give you the option of sharing your thoughts, personal information, or skiing and snowboarding experiences automatically on their platforms. If you choose to share information with a third-party site such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, the information you choose to share on those sites is not subject to this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>. You should review the privacy policies of those websites to make an informed decision about whether to share your information on those sites. Further, you should review your account settings on those sites to ensure that you are comfortable sharing your information with the audience chosen in that account.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location Information</span></p> <p>From time to time, we may use technology that provides us with information about your geographic location (“location information”). For example, when you ride a chairlift of one of our resorts, we scan or read your ski pass. We read passes through the use of handheld scanners or passive radio frequency readers mounted on or near our chairlifts. This information helps us monitor use of the lifts and tells us when you ride one of our chairlifts. When we collect location data about our guests offline, we may combine that information with personal information that we collect online and use the information to better understand our guests or to provide you with information or services. Location Information collected and combined in that manner is subject to this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children’s Privacy</span></p> <p>We will not knowingly collect personal information on our Sites from children under the age of 13 without the prior consent of the child’s parent or guardian. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 may have provided personal information to us without consent of the child’s parent or guardian, please contact us at <a href="mailto:800Mammoth@mammoth-mtn.com">800Mammoth@mammoth-mtn.com</a></p> <p>You may not register on our Sites or open an account if you are under the age of 13. The Sites are not directed to individuals under the age of 13, nor do they contain information which would be potentially harmful to minors in any way.&nbsp; However, we advise all visitors to the Sites under the age of 13 not to disclose or provide any Personally Identifiable Information. In the event that Mammoth Resorts discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personally Identifiable Information to us, we will delete the child's Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230 (d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections are commercially available to assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.&nbsp; More information on the availability of such software can be found through publicly available sources. You may wish to contact your Internet Service Provider for more information.</p> <p>Please see the Federal Trade Commission's website for this act:&nbsp; http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/ for more information.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opting Out </span></p> <p><em>Opt-Out of Receiving Future Communications</em></p> <p>Our Sites give you the option of not receiving future communications from us by unsubscribing from our lists at <a href="http://www.mammothmountain.com/winter/home/email-unsubscribe">http://www.mammothmountain.com/winter/home/email-unsubscribe</a> or by sending an email to 800Mammoth@mammoth-mtn.com</p> <p><em>Review and Update Your Information</em></p> <p>You may also review or update your personal information collected by this Site or correct factual inaccuracies by emailing 800mammoth@mammoth-mtn.com</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How We Protect Your Information</span></p> <p>Mammoth Resorts has appropriate physical, technological, and organizational safeguards and security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure of your personal information under our control. However, it is important that you understand that no website or database is completely secure, or “hacker proof.” You can help us by protecting and keeping your passwords safe at all times. You can protect yourself and help us prevent computer crime by promptly notifying us if you suspect that your credit card, pass product with PassCash, user name or password is lost, stolen or used without permission. Also, you can reduce many risks by using up to date antivirus software.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to the Privacy Policy</span></p> <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Sites. The changes will only apply to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We will attempt to notify you of any significant changes to this Privacy Policy by sending an email notice. However, it is your responsibility to check this Site for updates as you will be bound by them if you choose to visit our Sites.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">California Privacy Rights</span></p> <p>Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27, or the “Shine the Light” law, allows California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosures in the prior calendar year, if any, of their personally identifiable information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at 800Mammoth@mammoth-mtn.com with “Request for California Privacy” in the letter subject line.
