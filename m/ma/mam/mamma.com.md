# Mamma.com - The Mother Of All Search Engines

  
**_Privacy Policy_**

Mamma.com respects your right to privacy. We understand the sensitive nature of privacy issues and the company takes measures to ensure that your confidentiality is protected.

By using Mamma.com, you consent to the following privacy policy. This policy is subject to change and updates will be posted on this page.

   _COVERAGE_

This policy applies to our URLs www.mamma.com and www.mama.com. More specifically, any URL ending with mamma.com, and that includes a link to this policy at the bottom of the page are covered by this privacy policy. The presence of the Mamma.com logo alone does not guarantee the applicability of this policy.

This policy does not apply to our partners, advertisers or any other web site that may be connected, in any way, with Mamma.com.

   _THIRD-PARTY LINKS_

As a search engine, and as an advertising publisher, you will find various kinds of links on our site, including but not limited to: meta-search results, Mamma Favorites, banners, Mamma Classifieds, and Mamma's Partners. These sites are owned and maintained by outside companies, over which Mamma.com has no control, and who are not covered by this privacy policy. Mamma.com is not responsible for the content of these sites, or their collection of information and its use. If you have any concerns about your privacy at one of these sites, please review their sites' policies or contact them directly.

   _BANNER ADVERTISEMENTS_

Third-party servers supply some of the banner advertisements that appear on Mamma.com. Some of these advertisers have the ability to deposit cookies on your computer in order to track performance and to limit the number of times a particular banner is shown to you. These cookies are separate from our own (see below) and the information collected from them is not shared with Mamma.com.

Like the links we provide to other web sites, these third-party servers are not covered by Mamma.com's privacy policy.

   _COOKIES_

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your computers' hard drive when visiting our site, and may also be transmitted when customizing your search preferences in our Power Search, or when registering for one of our services. No personal information is stored within the cookie. It is an anonymous piece of data that simply identifies your computer IP address, but not you.

Cookies are used to identify you as a unique user, and to let us know when you return to our site. They are used to provide customizable services, serve relevant advertising, and to monitor our traffic.

You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of your browser. Or, you can opt to be warned before a cookie is deposited on your computer.

   _CONTACT INFORMATION_

Mamma.com only has access to your personal (identifiable) contact information in the following circumstances:

1\. When you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to Mamma.com via email, and include an email address and/or contact information. In these cases, Mamma.com only uses this information to respond to you.

2\. When you participate in special offers, contests, or surveys, the collection of contact information is often required for registration, and for winner notification. In some instances, these are co-sponsored and so your information will be shared with that particular partner.

3\. Signing up for Mamma services, including but not limited to the affiliates program, premium placement advertising, and partnership programs require registration, and the submission of certain information, which often includes contact information. Some of these products also require payment information in addition to contact details. To ensure your security in these circumstances Mamma.com uses a third-party credit card processing site for the entrance and (possible) storage of your credit card information. If you are not willing to provide this information to Mamma.com you may choose not to participate in these programs.

Please note, that some contests or services advertised on or through Mamma.com may require personal contact information in order to enter or register. This information is not shared with Mamma.com, and these advertisers are not covered by this privacy policy (please see Third-Party Links, above).

   _UNSOLICITED CONTACT_

Mamma.com will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third-parties, unless otherwise stated (please see 2, under Contact Information). We may, however, occasionally send emails to subscribers of our services, or survey respondents regarding new services or offers from Mamma.com or selected partners that may be of interest.

Mamma.com respects your right to unsubscribe from company mailings at any time. To do so, please email [customerservice@mamma.com](mailto:customerservice@mamma.com).

   _INFORMATION SHARING_

Mamma.com shares the information we gather from cookies, clients, survey respondents, etc., with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other selected 3rd parties. This sharing of information is only done in an aggregate form for statistical purposes. We never distribute personally identifiable information without your consent, unless we are required to do so by law (due to a court order, subpoena, etc), or to protect Mamma.com, our users, or the general public.

   _SECURITY_

Mamma.com has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of user and customer data under our control. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of the data will not occur, we promise to do our utmost to prevent against any such occurrences.

**For additional information,** or to express your concerns, please contact [search@mamma.com](mailto:search@mamma.com).
