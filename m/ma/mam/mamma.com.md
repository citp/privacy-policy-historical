If you wish to solely use the Mamma.com Meta search engine you will not be required to fill out any form of registration. 

During your use of our site, we may collect demographic and profile data. This data is used so we may enhance your experience at our site (i.e. showing you content that you may be interested in according to your preferences). We may share this information with selected advertisers and sponsors. If you do not wish demographic or profile information to be shared, then you may opt-out at the time of registration. At no time will information that personally identifies you or enables an advertiser to communicate with you directly be distributed to any third party.
