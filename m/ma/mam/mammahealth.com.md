Untitled Document |   | 

Mamma.com respects your right to privacy. We understand the sensitive nature of privacy issues and the company takes measures to ensure that your confidentiality is protected. To help in this goal, the Mamma.com website is compliant with the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. To learn more about the P3P Project, please [click here](http://www.w3.org/P3P/).

By using Mamma.com, you consent to the following privacy policy. This policy is subject to change and updates will be posted on this page from time to time.

Coverage  
This policy applies to our URLs www.mamma.com and www.mama.com, www.mamma.ca. More specifically, any URL ending with mamma.com, and that includes a link to this policy at the bottom of the page are covered by this privacy policy. The presence of the Mamma.com logo alone does not guarantee the applicability of this policy.

This policy does not apply to our partners, advertisers or any other web site that may be connected, in any way, with Mamma.com who may or may not adhere to similar policies and as such cannot be responsible for their actions.

Links to Other Sites  
As a search engine, and as an advertising publisher, you will find various links on our site, including but not limited to: metasearch results, Mamma Classifieds, Sponsored Listings, and Mamma's Partners. These sites are owned and maintained by independent companies, over which Mamma.com has no control, and who are not covered by this privacy policy. Mamma.com is not liable or responsible for the content of these sites, or their collection of information and its use. If you have any concerns about your privacy at one of these sites, please review their sites' policies or contact them directly.

Third-Party Services  
Some services offered on the Mamma.com website are wholly maintained and provided to Mamma.com by third-party websites, as is. These services operate under their own set of privacy policies. Mamma.com's White Pages, through which you may insert your own directory listing, and Mamma.com's Yellow Pages services are both provided to Mamma.com by InfoSpace Inc. You may view InfoSpace's privacy policy by [clicking here](http://www.infospace.com/home/about/corporate/privacy.htm).

Cookies  
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your computers' hard drive when visiting our site, and may also be transmitted when customizing your search preferences in our Power Search, or when downloading one of our search tools. No personal information is stored within the cookie. It is an anonymous piece of data that simply identifies your computer IP address, but not you.

Cookies are used to identify you as a unique user, and to let us know when you return to our site. They are used to provide customizable services, serve relevant advertising, and to monitor our traffic.

You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of your browser. Or, you can opt to be warned before a cookie is deposited on your computer. It should be noted, however, that some Mamma.com features or services might not work properly if cookies are turned off. Alternatively, you can periodically delete cookies from your computers' hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous web surfing. If you delete cookies, you will not be recognized as a repeat visitor or viewer when returning to a site.

Anonymous Information  
During normal operations of the Mamma.com website, Mamma.com collects limited non-identifiable information from each of our users, in order to help us improve our services, monitor our traffic and servers, and perform research and anonymous aggregate user analyses. This information is stored in our server log files, and includes IP address, search terms, the date and time of your visit, click-through links, and referral data.

Use of the Mamma.com metasearch engine does not require any personally identifiable information, such as your name or email address.

Identifiable Information  
Mamma.com only has access to your personally identifiable information in the following circumstances:

  1. When you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to Mamma.com via email, and include an email address and/or contact information. In these cases, Mamma.com only uses this information to respond to you.

  2. When you email your results either to yourself, or to someone else, and include an email and name. Though Mamma.com does not monitor this information, or maintain it for statistical purposes, it could still be considered accessible by Mamma.com.

  3. When you participate in special offers, contests, or surveys, the collection of contact information is often required for registration, and for winner notification. In some instances, these are co-sponsored and so your information will be shared with that particular partner.




Please note, that some contests or services advertised on or through Mamma.com may require personal contact information in order to enter or register. This information is not shared with Mamma.com, and these advertisers are not covered by this privacy policy (please see Links to Other Sites, above) although they may adhere to their own similar policies.

Unsolicited Contact  
Mamma.com will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third parties, unless otherwise stated (please see 2, under Identifiable Information) or agreed to by yourself. We may, however, occasionally send emails to subscribers of our services, or survey respondents regarding new services or offers from Mamma.com or selected partners that may be of interest.

Mamma.com respects your right to unsubscribe from company mailings at any time. To do so, please contact our Customer Service Department.

Information Sharing  
Mamma.com shares the information we gather from cookies, survey respondents, etc., with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other selected third parties. This sharing of information is only done in an aggregate form for statistical purposes. We never distribute personally identifiable information without your consent, unless we are required to do so by law (due to a court order, subpoena, etc), or to protect Mamma.com, our users, or the general public. Furthermore, we restrict access to any personally identifiable information that you may have provided to us to employees that need this information in order to correspond with you, or operate the website or a particular service.

Security  
Mamma.com has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of user and customer data under our control. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of the data will not occur, we promise to do our utmost to prevent against any such occurrences.

Children Under 13 Years of Age  
In light of the concern over protecting children's privacy online, Mamma.com does not knowingly request, collect, or share personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13.
