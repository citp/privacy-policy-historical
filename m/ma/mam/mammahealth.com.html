      <p>Mamma.com respects your right to privacy. We understand the

website is compliant with the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project
developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. To learn more about the P3P
Project, please <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/">click here</a>.</p>

<p>By using Mamma.com, you consent to the following privacy policy. This
policy is subject to change and updates will be posted on this page from
time to time.</p>

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Coverage</span><br>
This policy applies to our URLs www.mamma.com and www.mama.com,
www.mamma.ca.  More specifically, any URL ending with mamma.com, and that

<p>This policy does not apply to our partners, advertisers or any other web
site that may be connected, in any way, with Mamma.com who may or may not
adhere to similar policies and as such cannot be responsible for their

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Third-Party Services</span><br>
Some services offered on the Mamma.com website are wholly maintained and

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Cookies</span><br>
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your computers' hard drive
when visiting our site, and may also be transmitted when customizing your
search preferences in our Power Search, or when downloading one of our
search tools. No personal information is stored within the cookie. It is an
anonymous piece of data that simply identifies your computer IP address, but
not you.</p>

<p>Cookies are used to identify you as a unique user, and to let us know when
you return to our site. They are used to provide customizable services,
serve relevant advertising, and to monitor our traffic.</p>

<p>You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of
your browser. Or, you can opt to be warned before a cookie is deposited on
your computer. It should be noted, however, that some Mamma.com features or
services might not work properly if cookies are turned off. Alternatively,
you can periodically delete cookies from your computers' hard drive,
clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous
web surfing. If you delete cookies, you will not be recognized as a repeat
visitor or viewer when returning to a site.</p>

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Anonymous Information</span><br>
During normal operations of the Mamma.com website, Mamma.com collects
limited non-identifiable information from each of our users, in order to
help us improve our services, monitor our traffic and servers, and perform
research and anonymous aggregate user analyses. This information is stored
in our server log files, and includes IP address, search terms, the date and
time of your visit, click-through links, and referral data.</p>

<p>Use of the Mamma.com metasearch engine does not require any personally
identifiable information, such as your name or email address.</p>

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Identifiable Information</span><br>
Mamma.com only has access to your personally identifiable information in the
following circumstances:</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>When you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to
Mamma.com via email, and include an email address and/or contact
information. In these cases, Mamma.com only uses this information to respond
to you.</p></li>

	<li><p>When you email your results either to yourself, or to someone else,
and include an email and name. Though Mamma.com does not monitor this
information, or maintain it for statistical purposes, it could still be
considered accessible by Mamma.com.</p></li>

	<li><p>When you participate in special offers, contests, or surveys, the
collection of contact information is often required for registration, and
for winner notification. In some instances, these are co-sponsored and so
your information will be shared with that particular partner.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please note, that some contests or services advertised on or through
Mamma.com may require personal contact information in order to enter or
register. This information is not shared with Mamma.com, and these
advertisers are not covered by this privacy policy (please see Links to
Other Sites, above) although they may adhere to their own similar
policies.</p>

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Unsolicited Contact</span><br>
Mamma.com will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third
parties, unless otherwise stated (please see 2, under Identifiable
Information) or agreed to by yourself. We may, however, occasionally send
emails to subscribers of our services, or survey respondents regarding new
services or offers from Mamma.com or selected partners that may be of
interest.</p>

<p>Mamma.com respects your right to unsubscribe from company mailings at any
time. To do so, please contact our Customer Service Department.</p>

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Information Sharing</span><br>
Mamma.com shares the information we gather from cookies, survey respondents,
etc., with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other selected
third parties. This sharing of information is only done in an aggregate form
for statistical purposes. We never distribute personally identifiable
information without your consent, unless we are required to do so by law
(due to a court order, subpoena, etc), or to protect Mamma.com, our users,
or the general public. Furthermore, we restrict access to any personally
identifiable information that you may have provided to us to employees that
need this information in order to correspond with you, or operate the
website or a particular service.</p>

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Security</span><br>
Mamma.com has security measures in place to help protect against the loss,
misuse and alteration of user and customer data under our control. While we
cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of the data will not occur,
we promise to do our utmost to prevent against any such occurrences.</p>

<p><span class="subsectionpara">Children Under 13 Years of Age</span><br>
In light of the concern over protecting children's privacy online, Mamma.com
does not knowingly request, collect, or share personally identifiable
information from users under the age of 13.</p>
