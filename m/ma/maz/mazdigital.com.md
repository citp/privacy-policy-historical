Please review our [Terms of Service Agreement](https://web.archive.org/terms) which governs your use of the Services. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning ascribed in the [Terms of Service Agreement](https://web.archive.org/terms).

This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Services or any other particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered on or in connection with the Services terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Services which require your personal information.

This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Services and whether you are accessing the Services as a registered user (i.e., an end user with a User Account) or otherwise. This Privacy Policy governs only the Information (as defined herein) collected by us on or in connection with the Services and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other entity or Third Party Processor, unless specifically stated. Where you have provided your personal information to third parties such as marketing companies or Advertisers and have provided sufficient consent, we may obtain such personal information and combine it with your Information (as defined herein) and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

You may choose to provide certain information to us when you use the Services. When we use the term " _Personal Information_ " we mean any information that we collect on or in connection with the Services that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, payment card information or telephone number. When we use the term " _Additional Information_ ", we mean any information that we collect about you through the Services other than Personal Information. (Personal Information and Additional Information shall be collectively referred to as " _Information_ ").
