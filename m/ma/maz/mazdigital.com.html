Please review our <a target="_blank" href="/terms">Terms of Service Agreement</a> which governs your use of the Services. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning ascribed in the <a target="_blank" href="/terms">Terms of Service Agreement</a>.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Services or any other particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered on or in connection with the Services terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Services which require your personal information.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Services and whether you are accessing the Services as a registered user (i.e., an end user with a User Account) or otherwise. This Privacy Policy governs only the Information (as defined herein) collected by us on or in connection with the Services and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other entity or Third Party Processor, unless specifically stated. Where you have provided your personal information to third parties such as marketing companies or Advertisers and have provided sufficient consent, we may obtain such personal information and combine it with your Information (as defined herein) and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>You may choose to provide certain information to us when you use the Services. When we use the term "<u>Personal Information</u>" we mean any information that we collect on or in connection with the Services that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, payment card information or telephone number. When we use the term "<u>Additional Information</u>", we mean any information that we collect about you through the Services other than Personal Information. (Personal Information and Additional Information shall be collectively referred to as "<u>Information</u>"). By visiting, accessing or otherwise using the Services, you affirmatively consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p><strong>1.	INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong></p>

        <p>1.1	<strong>User Registration.</strong> If you elect to become a registered user of the Services, we will require you to provide as part of your User Account certain Information, which may include, but not be limited to, your email address, legal name, telephone number(s), company name, etc., and, in order to conduct fee-based transactions and other activities, your physical address, applicable payment data (<em>e.g.</em>, payment card number and expiration date), etc.</p>

In addition, you may be presented with the opportunity to sign up to receive newsletters, email communications, or other communications from us in order for us to provide up-to-date information about the Services, and to publicize and promote certain content, products and services offered by us or our business partners. When there is a separate sign-up for newsletters, we may ask for your contact information such as name and email address, and, sometimes, demographic and profile information.  We may ask you to confirm your consent to these uses at the time you sign up for these services or communications.</p>

        <p>1.3	<strong>Information Collected Through Automatic Data Collection.</strong> Our Services include features that automatically collect your Internet protocol (IP) address and Additional Information regarding your visits to the Site and use of the Services to assist us in keeping track of your preferences, create a more tailored user experience and better serve your particular interests and needs.</p>

Some cookies are used to make login to our Services easier (such as by remembering your User Account).  Cookies also enable us to track your interaction with the Site and Services, and target your interests to enhance your experience with the Services. We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your Device to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on use the Services, pages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the Device you use to access and use the Services for the same purposes.

Such services may enable us to display advertisements based on your use of the Services and other websites you have visited. Targeting services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</p>

        <p>You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  For example, if you are using Internet Explorer, search for "Cookies" in the Help menu to find detailed instructions.

        <p>4.4 <strong>Additional Disclosures.</strong> There may be instances when we may access or disclose Information without providing you a choice in the following circumstances: (a) to protect or defend the legal rights or property of Company, our affiliated companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (b) to protect the safety and security of our Site, the Services and users; (c) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (d) if we believe your actions violate the <a target="_blank" href="/terms">Terms of Service Agreement</a>, this Privacy Policy, or any Additional Terms; or (e) to comply with law or legal process.

Other privacy preferences (<em>e.g.</em>, deactivating your User Account) may be made by modifying your account settings on the Site. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Company will get your permission before we use the Personal Information you provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was submitted or share your Personal Information with third parties that are not affiliated with Company. If you ask Company to stop using your Personal Information, we will honor that request while retaining a record of any Personal Information as necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law, to conduct legitimate business activities.

        <p><strong>6.	SECURITY</strong></p>

        <p>While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Services, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We also limit access to the Services by our own employees, contractors, Site service providers and those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information. We request that our third party contractors and Site service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.</p>

        <p><strong>7.	YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>

        <p>If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.  If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to our Privacy Administrator at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:support@mazdigital.com">support@mazdigital.com</a> or by postal mail to MAZ Digital Inc., PO Box 134, Pleasantville, NY 10570, Attn: Your California Privacy Rights.</p>

        <p><strong>9.	PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong></p>
