As such, we are strongly committed to providing a transparent and coordinated approach to managing the interaction with our customers.

Typically, information may be provided to a Mazda dealer or Mazda Australia in the following ways:</p><ul><li>By a potential customer for the purpose of ongoing communications, including name, address and contact details; </li><li>At the time of a test-drive in the form of Driver's Licence details; </li><li>At the time of purchasing a new car including name, address, contact and licence details; </li><li>At the time of arranging finance for the car including information covered under the terms of the finance agreement (which are covered under the provisions of the relevant Credit Act); </li><li>Through various surveys, research and customer-initiated contact with Mazda; </li><li>By using the various request forms on the Mazda web site which include name, address and contact details; </li><li>When having the car serviced.</li></ul><p>The personally identifying information collected may consist of basic contact information: Name, title, home address, email address, and telephone and fax numbers.

It is Mazda's policy to ensure that the information collected is relevant to the experience of owning and driving a Mazda.</p><p>Visitors are also able to send emails from the Mazda web site. These messages may contain the user's screen name and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include in the message.</p><p>The Mazda policy is not to seek any sensitive information through interaction with our customers. In the case of fleet purchases, sensitive information in relation to the membership (of an individual) of a trade or similar association may be provided during the course of the transaction but it is Mazda's policy not to actively seek this information. Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating to: race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; sexual life or criminal record. We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature. If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, Mazda accepts your explicit consent to use that information in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information.</p><h2>2. Are communications tracked and log files used?</h2><p>To ensure that we are familiar with the interaction of our customers and the various departments within Mazda, various measures have been put in place by Mazda to collect and collate customer information. This may include tracking of the various interactions with Mazda and its dealer network.</p><p>In the case of contact via the Mazda web site, cookies and electronic log files are not used to identify web visitors. </p><h2>3.

This data is not shared with other entities for secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with a third party, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. If there is an instance where such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for permission beforehand.</p><p>Mazda makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data.

What choices are available for the collection and use of identifying information?</h2><p>As a policy, visitors are not required to register to gain access to areas of the Mazda web site. In certain cases in the future, as your Mazda Website experience expands, we may require visitors to register in order to obtain a user-id and password for authentication and secure access to a transaction or certain confidential information services on premium customer Websites.</p><p>Personally identifiable information provided to Mazda through its Website is provided voluntarily by visitors. Should visitors subsequently choose to unsubscribe from mailing lists or any registrations, we will provide instructions, on the appropriate Website area or in communications to our visitors; or a visitor may contact the privacy officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@mazda.com.au" class="link">privacy@mazda.com.au</a>.</p><h2>7. Can I change or delete the information later?</h2><p>Each visitor has the right of access to personal data that they have submitted to Mazda.</p><p>User updates of information should, in the first instance, be addressed to the privacy officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@mazda.com.au" class="link">privacy@mazda.com.au</a>. Inquiries about the accuracy of identifying information previously submitted to Mazda through its web site, or requests to have outdated information removed, should be directed to: <a href="mailto:cservice@mazda.com.au" class="link">cservice@mazda.com.au</a>.

When requested, Mazda will suppress identifying information from current operational systems for the purpose of mailings or other communications except in case of recall or similar matters.</p><p>When personally identifiable information is retained, Mazda assumes responsibility for keeping an accurate record of the information once a visitor has submitted and verified their own information. Mazda does not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personal information. When practically possible, if Mazda is informed that any personal data collected is no longer accurate, Mazda will make appropriate corrections based on the updated information provided by the customer.</p><h2>8. How is my information secured?</h2><p>Mazda has implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. All Mazda employees and agents commit to a company-wide security policy. Only authorized Mazda personnel are provided access to personally identifiable information and these employees have agreed to ensure confidentiality of this information. </p><h2>9. Changes to the Mazda Privacy Statement</h2><p>Mazda reserves the right to modify or amend this Statement at any time and for any reason. Nothing contained in this Statement is intended to create a contract or agreement by Mazda.</p><p>In order to keep visitors informed, Mazda will notify users of changes to our Privacy Statement. We will do this by identifying the alteration for a period of not less than two weeks on our home page at <a href="http://www.mazda.com.au/">www.mazda.com.au</a> and identifying the effective date at the beginning of such statements.</p><h2>10. Children's online privacy protection</h2><p>Mazda understands the importance of protecting children's privacy especially in an online environment. The Mazda interactions covered by this privacy statement are not intentionally designed for, or directed at, children or those below the driving age. It is Mazda's policy never to knowingly collect or maintain information about a minor.</p><h2>11.
