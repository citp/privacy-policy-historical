## Cookies and online privacy

In common with most websites, [majestic.co.uk](https://majestic.co.uk/) uses "cookies". Cookies are small snippets of text that are stored on your computer. When you request a page from our website, the cookies are sent to our web server, and when we send a page back to you our server may add to or change these cookies. Without cookies, we would not be able to know that you are the same person from page to page. We do not store anything that could identify you personally in cookies; instead we store codes and references which can only be connected to your personal details by our own systems.

We use cookies for a variety of reasons, such as remembering the contents of your shopping trolley, your preferences such as your local store, and displaying the products you've recently viewed. We also use analytics software, which allows us to track and measure patterns of behaviour among our users so that we can improve our website.

Additionally, we have partnerships with some carefully chosen third party services which involve including some code on our website, for example so that we can jointly measure the effectiveness of our marketing activities or enable you to share content with your friends. In some cases these partners may also store and retrieve their own cookies on your computer. Cookies set by websites other than majestic.co.uk are known as "third party cookies".

In accordance with the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003, and to be as open and transparent as possible, we have provided more information on the cookies in use on majestic.co.uk here (including our blog at blog.majestic.co.uk and Careers website at careers.majestic.co.uk). These details may change over time as we continue to develop our website, and we are investing in finding ways to reduce our use of cookies whilst continuing to deliver the best experience possible for our customers.

We have grouped our cookies into four categories:

  1. **Strictly Necessary** these cookies are essential to the operation of our site
  2. **Performance** these cookies allow us to monitor the performance of our website in a non-personally identifiable way
  3. **Functionality** these cookies allow us to add services to enhance user experience and remember settings, but will not be used by third parties to track you personally
  4. **Targeting** these cookies are used by third parties to provide services, such as social networks and advertising networks who may use the information obtained to serve relevant adverts to you



You can change the settings in your web browser to allow or deny different websites from setting cookies. Please note that disabling "first party cookies" from majestic.co.uk will affect the successful functioning of the site, and you will not be able to use the shopping trolley or checkout. For more information on cookies, see allaboutcookies.org.

## Email tracking

Some emails we send include tracking codes so that we can tell how many people open and click on links in those emails. Usually this information is used for aggregated statistics, but we can also track, at an individual level, whether a particular user has opened and clicked on an email. Using cookies as described above we can also determine if a particular user has completed a transaction. Sometimes we use this information to re-email people who didn't click the first time, or who did or didn't complete a purchase. If you want to be sure that none of your email activity is tracked in this way then you should not subscribe to our email mailing list. Existing subscribers can unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of every marketing email we send.

If you have any further questions about this, please email us at [info@majestic.co.uk](mailto:info@majestic.co.uk) and we will be happy to help.
