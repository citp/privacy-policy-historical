# Majestic Wine Warehouses

### Our security policy

Your personal and payment details are captured online using industry-standard 128-bit Secure Socket Layer technology, which encrypts all information to make it secure.

You now have the option to save credit card details along with address details in your Express Checkout Profile, which speeds up the ordering process. This is entirely optional. Credit card information is held on our systems in encrypted form and can only be accessed by using your account password.

We strongly advise that you keep your password secret at all times. Your password is also held on our systems in encrypted form and can not be accessed even by us. If you believe that somebody may have found out your password you should change it immediately. Alternatively, notify us at [info@majestic.co.uk](mailto:info@majestic.co.uk) and we can suspend your account.

At Majestic we take fraud prevention extremely seriously. For your protection, when processing your order we will take all appropriate measures to validate your card details.

### Our privacy policy

Majestic has always held a customer database, and we have never given the details to anyone else. When you register with us, and whenever you are logged in, the information is captured using the same SSL technology as card details.

Customers who shop with us can choose to be added to our mailing list and receive updated full colour price lists 5 times a year, together with other relevant information on our seasonal promotions. You may also subscribe to email updates. We do not release information to third parties. You have the option not to be included on the mailing list.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003.

We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service.

We will not e-mail you in the future unless you have given us your consent in accordance with the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003. We will give you the chance to refuse any marketing email from us or from another trader in the future. The type of information we will collect about you includes:

  * Your name
  * Address
  * Phone number
  * E-mail address
  * Credit/debit card details



We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by emailing us at [info@majestic.co.uk](mailto:info@majestic.co.uk). If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first.

We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a 'cookie' which would be stored on your browser.
