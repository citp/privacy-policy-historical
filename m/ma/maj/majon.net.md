Our web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.

**What other information do you request?**  
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists, account updates or information about new products and services). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.   
In addition, Majon International will not send you email that you have not agreed to receive. We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new Majon International products and services. In many cases while ordering services you may be required to provide your postal or billing address. This information is never shared or given to outside third parties. It is only used in order to communicate with you directly about your account or other happenings at Majon International or their holdings. When you sign up for a Majon International forum, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used to monitor your activity within a forum, nor is it used to identify you outside the Majon International Network in any way. When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

**  
What information do you collect when I purchase something?**  
If you are purchasing something from an Majon International property, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related product and services. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose without your express permission.

Certain Majon International properties use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other Majon International media properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer information.

In many instances when Majon International collects personal information, a reasonable effort is made to included a link to this Privacy Policy if applicable. Additionally, our privacy policy link is always available from our main web site at: [_http://www.majon.com_](http://www.majon.com/)

**Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?**  
Majon International will disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:   
1) Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on Majon International,   
2) Protect and defend the rights or property of the Majon International Network of sites, or visitors to the Majon International Network of sites,   
3) Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice, or the rights of third parties,   
4) Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities.   
Majon International uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. Majon International reserves the right to transfer information in connection with the sale of all or part of Majon International's capital stock or assets. Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. Majon International also links to a wide variety of other sites and contains advertisements of third parties. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users

**Opt-in announcement List Privacy Policy**  
As an added benefit to the visitors of the Majon International Network of sites, we use our own Listkingpro Software to send e-mail announcements to individuals who request to receive them. When you sign up for a Majon International e-mail newsletter or email forum, you may be given the opportunity to also receive additional announcement lists from ListkingPro. Whether you want to receive these announcement lists is your choice; you should only receive those lists you affirmatively choose to.

  
**What else should I know about my privacy when online?**  
The Majon International Network of web sites contains many links to other web sites. Majon International is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. Majon International does not share any of the individual personal information you provide to Majon International with any of the sites to which Majon International links, although Majon International may share aggregate data with such web sites (such as how many people use our web site etc.).

**Please check with those sites to determine their privacy policy.**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. It is therefore wise to be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
