### How to Stop Receiving Messages

If you receive a message that was sent via MailUp (e.g. you see the MailUp logo in the footer), it means that a business that you have or had a relationship with has become a User of the MailUp Service and your email address or mobile phone number exists in one of the lists they manage from their MailUp account. 

If you do not wish to receive additional messages from that business, simply click on the unsubscribe link that should exist somewhere in the body of the email message or reply STOP or END to the text message you received. If you are for any reason unable to unsubscribe, contact the business and let them know that you wish to unsubscribe. If you are still receiving messages after doing so, you can report the case to MailUp by sending a message to abuse@mailup.it. When you do so, please also send a copy of the complaint to the email sender of the unsolicited message.
