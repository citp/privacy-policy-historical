                  We are committed to comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”).  COPPA defines a "Child" as anyone under the age of 13. Children are not eligible to use the site unsupervised. If you are under the age of 13, you may only use this site in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians.
                  Parents are required to use their email address for
                  registration as we do not collect or store any personal
                  information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and
                  discover that your child under the age of 13 has registered
                  for an account you may alert us to have the account and any
                  related private information deleted from our servers. Internet safety experts have advised that children do not fully appreciate the risk of providing too much personal information online or communicating with strangers they encounter online.<br>
                  <br>
                  While we appreciate that children may want to use our websites, we urge parents to instruct their children not to lie about their age so as to be able to use our websites before they are old enough. We want to remind parents that they need to spend time with their children and take an active role in their safety online and offline. They should work to help teach them not to give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet.<br>
