**_Data Protection & Security_**

  
**Security**

We store most of your personal data electronically. We implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, misuse or interference or the unauthorized disclosure, access or modification to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned.

The security of your information is paramount and a critical consideration for Mail2World in the provision of its services to you. Please see further information on the security measures we engage on our websites and platform and when you use any of our services.

We work hard to protect you and Mail2World from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. Measures we take include:

·      placing confidentiality requirements and restricted access protocols on our staff members and service providers who need access to your information in order to process it to provide our services to you;

·       destroying your personal information if it is no longer needed to provide you with our service;

·       destroying logging or other transactional information that may incidentally contain personal information in accordance with our schedules to clear such information;

·       following strict security procedures in the access, storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorized access to it; and

·       using secure communication transmission software (known as "secure sockets layer" or "SSL") that encrypts all information you input on our website before it is sent to us. SSL is an industry standard encryption protocol and this ensure that the information is reasonably protected against unauthorized interception.

As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer and/or device you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your user IDs and passwords, please take appropriate measures to protect this information.

**Data Retention and Right to be Forgotten (Deletion)**

We will store your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this privacy policy. Where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner.

In some circumstances we may store your personal data for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements. Where we log information related to your IP address, we retain this information for approximately 90 days. This is for the purposes of fraud watch, as often users don’t check in with us in a timely fashion over whether their account is compromised. Being able to look at some amount of recent history and know what activity was taken by a legitimate user vs a malicious one is useful.

We proscribe your primary email address, if it’s at one of our domains, for up to 6 six months after your account is closed, to reduce the risk of impersonation, should someone try to use the same email address as you in order to impersonate you.

Where you request that we delete your account from our system, we will immediately lock the account and archive the information, then delete it from our severs within approximately 7 days from the date of your request. This archive window allows you to recover your information in the event of an accident or malicious deletion request.

However, in specific limited circumstances we may store your personal data for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal data or dealings.

**Children's data**

We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we learned that we have collected the personal information of a child less than 13 years old, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Our website and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at  _[support@mail2world.com](mailto:support@mail2world.com)_.
