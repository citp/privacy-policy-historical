</p><h3>Quick Summary:</h3>
<p>
We don't collect any information from people simply visiting our site, or from people requesting a sample email be sent to them.<br>

We don't share, give away, or sell your (or your recipients') information to anyone. Ever. We hate that stuff.<br>

</p><ul>
<li>Are sending spam
</li><li>Send sick stuff
</li><li>Abuse our system in any way
</li><li>Violate our <a href="/terms.phtml" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Terms of Use</a>
</li></ul>
<br>
We'll only contact our own <b>registered users</b> if:
<ul>
<li>Mail Chimp services or policies change in any way that affects registered users
</li><li>We experience problems with your payments
</li><li>You are found in violation of our terms (if we're getting complaints of abuse from your account, for example)
</li></ul>
