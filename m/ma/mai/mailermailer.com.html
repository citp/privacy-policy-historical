   <!-- TOP NAVIGATION TABLE ENDS HERE --><p>MailerMailer.com is an email list management service
provided by <b>MailerMailer LLC</b>.</p>

<p> 
To report any abuse or violations of the MailerMailer email list service,
please send
email to <a href="mailto:abuse@mailermailer.com">abuse@mailermailer.com</a>
and attach an unedited copy of the email message that you feel was sent to
you in error or without your permission. Include all header information so
that we can trace origin of the message. Also include any notes or
other information that you feel are pertinent. Any questions or concerns
regarding this privacy policy may be directed to <a href="mailto:privacy@mailermailer.com">privacy@mailermailer.com</a>.
</p>

<h4>Web Site Information Collection</h4>
<p>
For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only
the consumer's domain name or IP address, but not the e-mail address. Unless
otherwise stated on our web site, we collect only the domain name or IP address
of visitors to our Web page, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate
with us via e-mail, the e-mail addresses of those who make postings to our chat
areas, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit,
user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, information
volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and registrations to
access portions of the site and their related services or to set up a
MailerMailer
account. We also collect clickstream information. 
We use SSL (secure socket layer) encryption for online payment
collection for purchases of our own proprietary products and services, which
includes the MailerMailer email list management service. We rely on third party
providers for some of our products and services which may be advertised via the
MailerMailer service--the privacy policies of those sites govern the method by
which they collect and use such information.</p>

<h4>Use of Web Site Information Collected</h4>
<p>
The information we collect is used to create an aggregate demographic profile
of our user base so that we can improve the content and services of our Web
site and provide aggregate information to potential advertisers (no individual
information is provided to any third-party without your consent), to customize
the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, to notify
consumers about updates to our Web site and services, to send visitors our
opt-in e-mail newsletter(s) (if requested by the visitor), to provide users with
the products and/or services for which they signed-up or registered which may
include sending service disruption notices or other service- or product-related
information via e-mail, and is not shared with other organizations for
commercial purposes without the visitor's consent. We may share collected 
information with another company in the event that we merge with or are acquired 
by another company. Customers may prevent their information from being used for 
purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by sending us e-mail 
at the above address.  Upon request we provide site visitors with access to contact 
information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them. You can 
access this information, and/or have it corrected, by logging into your account 
online.</p>

<h4>Use of Your Email List Information</h4>
<p>
MailerMailer is not an email list rental service and does
not rent or sell any email addresses or other contact
information that you provide or collect regarding your email list
members.  At all times, you retain ownership and control of
your email lists and list information.  When you schedule an email
message to be broadcast to your list members, MailerMailer
sends your message based on the personalization, targeting,
click tracking, and other criteria that you specified when
you created and scheduled your message.  Please keep your
account number and password secure at all times, changing
your password regularly as you would on other computer
systems to prevent unauthorized access or use.
</p>
<p>
In order to comply with government legislation, email addresses which
have requested no further contact will be placed on a suppression list
which may be accessed by other organizations to maintain suppression
of such addresses in their mailings as well as ours.
</p>

<h4>E-mail and Direct Response Contact</h4>
<p>
<u>All of our direct response methods are opt-in</u>.  If you subscribed
to our e-mail newsletter(s) but do not want to receive it in the future, please
follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained in the newsletter(s).</p>

<p><u>Third-Party Opt-In E-mail</u>: If you opted into our "third-party"
e-mail lists (such as but not limited to those run for us by Postmaster Direct
and DoubleClick), your e-mail may be made available to other organizations
whose products or services you might find interesting. If you do not want your
e-mail address to be shared with other companies or organizations, please do
not opt into this e-mail list(s) when asked this question. If you opted into this
list(s) and want to opt out, follow the instructions on the e-mail that is sent
to you to "Unsubscribe" to that list(s).</p>

<h4>Postal Address Collection and Use</h4>
<p>
If you supply us with your postal address on-line, we will use it to send you the
information for which you provided us your address.  If you supply us with your telephone number on-line, we will use it to 
contact you with information regarding your account, orders your have placed, or
with information regarding your inquiry.  We may send you information about
additional services that we offer, but we will not rent or sell your contact information
to any third parties without your permission.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>
We, and some of our partners who provide some of the services and products on
our site, use cookies to record session information, such as items that consumers
add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages
users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to provide
better service when visitors return to our site, customize Web page content
based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends,
and to enable access to specific areas on the web site.</p>

<h4>Ad Servers and Other Partners</h4>
<p>
To try and bring you offers that may be of interest to you, we have
relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads or provide other
services or products on our Web pages, our e-mail newsletter(s), the free
version of the MailerMailer service, and other services. As a result of your
visit to our site, these companies may collect non-personally-identifiable
information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream
information.

</p><h4>Children's Guidelines</h4>
<p>
This website is directed at adults, not children, and we do not seek to collect
from children online contact information or distribution to third parties any
personally identifiable information from children or entice children to divulge
information to us.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as
financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and notify
visitors through a pop-up screen on our site (which is displayed automatically
depending on your browser's security settings). We strive to maintain
appropriate security measures in our physical facilities to protect against the
loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at
our site. Although we take reasonable measures to secure our data, we cannot
guarantee that the measures we take are or will remain adequate. Some portions
of our sites and services link to other companies' web sites. Please refer to
the privacy policies of those sites for information on how they handle security
for information they collect.</p>

<h4>Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses
not previously disclosed in this Privacy Policy notice. If our information
practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to
our Web site's Privacy Policy page to notify you of these changes and provide
you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about
how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site's Privacy
Policy page periodically.</p>
