<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
 <p>
  This privacy policy covers all services provided by <strong>MailerMailer LLC</strong>, including
  MailerMailer.com, Presstacular.com, and MailerMailer Curated Newsletters.
 </p>

 <p>
  To report any abuse or violations of the MailerMailer services, please send email to 
  <a href="mailto:abuse@mailermailer.com">abuse@mailermailer.com</a> and attach an unedited copy of the email that you feel was sent to you in error or without your permission. Include all header information so
  that we can trace origin of the email. Also include any notes or other information that you feel are
  pertinent. Any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy may be directed to
  <a href="mailto:privacy@mailermailer.com">privacy@mailermailer.com</a>.
 </p>

 <h3>Web Site Information Collection</h3>

 <p>
  For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name or
  IP address, but not the email address. Unless otherwise stated on our web site, we collect only the domain
  name or IP address of visitors to our Web page, the email addresses of those who communicate with us via
  email, the email addresses of those who make postings to our chat areas, aggregate information on what pages
  consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, information
  volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and registrations to access portions of the site and
  their related services or to set up a MailerMailer account.
 </p>

 <p>
  We also collect clickstream information. We use SSL (secure socket layer) encryption for online payment
  collection for purchases of our own proprietary products and services, which includes the MailerMailer email
  list management service. We rely on third party providers for some of our products and services which may be
  advertised via the MailerMailer service — the privacy policies of those sites govern the method by which
  they collect and use such information.
 </p>

 <h3>Use of Web Site Information Collected</h3>
 
 <p>
  The information we collect is used to create an aggregate demographic profile of our user base so that we can
  improve the content and services of our Web site and provide aggregate information to potential advertisers
  (no individual information is provided to any third-party without your consent), to customize the content
  and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, to notify consumers about updates to our Web site and
  services, to send visitors our opt-in email newsletter(s) (if requested by the visitor), to provide users
  with the products and/or services for which they signed-up or registered which may include sending service
  disruption notices or other service- or product-related information via email, and is not shared with other
  organizations for commercial purposes without the visitor's consent. 
</p>

 <p>
  We may share collected information with another company in the event that we merge with or are acquired by
  another company. Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for
  which it was originally collected by sending us email at the above address. Upon request we provide site
  visitors with access to contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them.
  You can access this information, and/or have it corrected, by logging into your account online.
 </p>

 <h3>Use of Your Email List Information</h3>

 <p>
  MailerMailer is not an email list rental service and does not rent or sell any email addresses or other
  contact information that you provide or collect regarding your email list members. At all times, you retain
  ownership and control of your email lists and list information. When you schedule an email campaign to be
  broadcast to your list members, MailerMailer sends your campaign based on the personalization, targeting,
  click tracking, and other criteria that you specified when you created and scheduled your campaign. Please
  keep your Login ID and password secure at all times, changing your password regularly as you would on other
  computer systems to prevent unauthorized access or use.
 </p>

 <p>
  In order to comply with government legislation, email addresses which have requested no further contact will
  be placed on a suppression list which may be accessed by other organizations to maintain suppression of such
  addresses in their mailings as well as ours.
 </p>

 <h3>Email and Direct Response Contact</h3>

 <p>
  <strong>All of our direct response methods are opt-in.</strong> If you subscribed to our email newsletter(s)
  but do not want to receive it in the future, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained in the
  newsletter(s).
 </p>

 <p>
  <strong>Third-Party Opt-In Email:</strong> If you opted into our "third-party" email lists (such as but not
  limited to those run for us by Postmaster Direct and DoubleClick), your email may be made available to other
  organizations whose products or services you might find interesting. If you do not want your email address
  to be shared with other companies or organizations, please do not opt into this email list(s) when asked this
  question. If you opted into this list(s) and want to opt out, follow the instructions on the email that is
  sent to you to "Unsubscribe" to that list(s).
 </p>

 <h3>Postal Address Collection and Use</h3>

 <p>
  If you supply us with your postal address on-line, we will use it to send you the information for which you
  provided us your address. If you supply us with your telephone number on-line, we will use it to contact you
  with information regarding your account, orders your have placed, or with information regarding your inquiry.
  We may send you information about additional services that we offer, but we will not rent or sell your
  contact information to any third parties without your permission.
 </p>

 <h3>Cookies</h3>

 <p>
  We, and some of our partners who provide some of the services and products on our site, use cookies to record
  session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific
  information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to provide better
  service when visitors return to our site, customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other
  information that the visitor sends, and to enable access to specific areas on the web site.
 </p>

 <h4>Do Not Track</h4>

 <p>
  We do not change our site's or service's behavior or tracking upon seeing a web browser's do not track signal.
 </p>


 <h3>Ad Servers and Other Partners</h3>

 <p>
  To try and bring you offers that may be of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that
  we allow to place ads or provide other services or products on our Web pages, our email newsletter(s), the
  free version of the MailerMailer service, and other services. As a result of your visit to our site, these
  companies may collect non-personally-identifiable information such as your domain type, your IP address and
  clickstream information. We may also use advertising services that enable tracking based on your name,
  email or other information to present you with information about or opportunities related to our tools and
  services.

  children to divulge information to us.
 </p>

 <h3>Security</h3>

 <p>
  When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we redirect
  visitors to a secure server. We strive to maintain appropriate security measures in our physical facilities to
  protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.
  Although we take reasonable measures to secure our data, we cannot guarantee that the measures we take are or
  will remain adequate. Some portions of our sites and services link to other companies' web sites (listed above).
  Please refer to the privacy policies of those sites for information on how they handle security for information
  they collect.
 </p>

 <h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>

 <p>
  From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in
  this Privacy Policy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post
  the policy changes to our Web site's Privacy Policy page to notify you of these changes and provide you with
  the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should
  check back at our Web site's Privacy Policy page periodically.
