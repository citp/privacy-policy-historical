   <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="37467B" style="font-size:18px"><a name="FAQ">Frequently Asked
   Questions</a></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-size:13.5px"><br><br>
   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px"><b>What are Cookies?</b></font><br><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make a Website more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major web sites like Mail2World use them to provide useful features for their customers.<br><br>
Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so.<br><br>
Once a user is logged into a Mail2World email account, our cookies tie in with that user's member ID, which is related to a username and email address. Personally identifiable Information is also tied to a user's IP address for security purposes, such as investigating illegal use of an email account or when a user asks us to find out if an intruder has accessed his or her account.<br><br>
Mail2World uses cookies so that you can maintain your identity (and thus, your privacy, personalization and preferences) throughout the site. For example, we identify you as a member, a system administrator or a content administrator, and those identities determine what you may do while on the site. In another example, we know which choices you made under the 'Options' section of the site, so those preferences will be carried along with your throughout the email service. Cookies enable Mail2World's privacy, personalization and preferences capabilities.<br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px"><b>How does Mail2World use my Contacts information?</b></font><br><br>
Mail2World stores, processes and maintains your Contacts data in order to provide the service to you. Any third-party contact's personally identifiable information that you may have entered into Contacts (e.g., friends, family, coworkers) is private and is not used for any purpose by Mail2World. The information collected in our Add Contact form includes names, titles, email addresses, phone numbers, IM names, Skype names, mailing addresses, birthdays, anniversaries, names of spouses or partners, employer's company and department, professional titles, work addresses, work web site, work manager's name, fax number and pager number.
<br><br>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px"><b>When I import my address book from another email account, how is that information handled?</b></font><br><br>
Mail2World offers an Import Contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts that you may have listed in other email address books.  Through our Import/Export Wizard, we make it easy for you to manually step through the process of accessing your contact information (e.g., Gmail account, .CSV file, vCard), then the Wizard automatically imports the contact information (i.e., contact names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, etc.) into your Mail2World Contacts. 
<br><br>
Mail2World's Contacts also allows you to request updates from your contacts by clicking the Request Update button in a contact's information panel. The invitation to update will be delivered in an email message displaying your "From" name, and the subject line will read: "[Contact's Name]: Update Your Contact Info." 
<br><br>



   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px"><b>Does Mail2World collect other forms of information about its users?</b></font><br><br>
In addition to the use of Personally identifiable Information to operate the site, Mail2World also gathers anonymous information, which may be used by Mail2World or shared with its advertisers. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" or "log files" and may entail the use of "IP addresses", "Protocol version", "Total access time", or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.  No tracking technologies are used within email communications our users send out or on pages where email addresses are collected.<br><br>
   <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px">How do I correct or change Personally identifiable Information that I have given to
   Mail2World?</font></b><br><br>
You may update this information at any time from within your Mail2World account
by clicking the 'Options' button on the navigation bar, and then clicking on the
'Profile' link.<br><br>
   <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px">Is my Personally identifiable Information secure from others using the Mail2World site?</font></b><br><br>
The security of your Personally identifiable Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this <a target="_blank" href="ssl.asp">link</a>. <br><br>
Mail2World follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information and email addresses you submit to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100-percent secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. <br><br>


We limit access to Personally Identifiable Information and email addresses to employees whom we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about security on the Mail2World Web site, you can send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@mail2world.com">support@mail2world.com</a> or <a href="http://www.mail2world.com/feedback.asp">click here to use our support form</a>.

   <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px">How is Mail2World registration information used in the Mail2World
   Directory and how can I remove my name from the Directory?</font></b><br><br>
During the Mail2World registration process you are given the choice as to
whether you want to be listed in the Mail2World Directory. If you did not make a
choice during the initial registration process, your registered name and
location is listed in the Mail2World Directory. At any time, you can change or
remove your personally identifiable information from the Mail2World Directory by clicking the
'Options' button on the navigation bar, and then clicking on the 'Profile' link.<br><br>
