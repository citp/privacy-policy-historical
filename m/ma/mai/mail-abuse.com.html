<p><strong>Privacy Statement:</strong></p>
<p>Kelkea, Inc ("Kelkea") has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the MAPS web site, currently available at www.mail-abuse.com (the "Site") is of great importance to us. MAPS is a division of Kelkea, Inc. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We may periodically update this Statement. We will post the revised Statement on the Site and we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the Statement.
