      <p>Personal Information about Users that is maintained on our systems
        is protected using industry standard security measures and mail2web.com
        complies with the security safeguards principal of Schedule 1, Clause

        4.9.5 of PIPEDA, You may also request that mail2web.com delete Your Personal
        Information from mail2web.com’s system and records

        backs up its systems, Personal Information may continue to reside in
        mail2web.com’s
        systems after deletion for some time. Individuals, therefore, should
        not expect that their Personal Information would be completely removed

        4.9.4 of PIPEDA, where information will not or cannot be disclosed, the
        individual making the request will be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure.
        Where information will be disclosed, mail2web.com will endeavour to provide
