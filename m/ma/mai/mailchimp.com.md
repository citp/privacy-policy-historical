or you can reach us by telephone at (404) 527-3609  


### Quick Summary:

We don't collect any information from people simply visiting our site, or from people requesting a sample email be sent to them.  
We only collect information from people that **register** for Mail Chimp services.  
We don't share, give away, or sell your (or your recipients') information to anyone. Ever. We hate that stuff.  
When you use Mail Chimp, you'll enter email addresses of your recipients. These recipients' email addresses are stored in your account, and will never be contacted by us.  
Yes, we can see what you're sending out through our server---we monitor our system constantly for jerks. We'll boot you from our system if you: 

  * Are sending spam 
  * Send sick stuff 
  * Abuse our system in any way 
  * Violate our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms.phtml "Opens new window")

  
We'll only contact our own **registered users** if: 

  * Mail Chimp services or policies change in any way that affects registered users 
  * We experience problems with your payments 
  * You are found in violation of our terms (if we're getting complaints of abuse from your account, for example)
