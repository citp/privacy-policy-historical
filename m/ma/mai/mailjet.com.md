**Cookies**

As a general rule, Mailjet uses cookies to improve and personalise the site and/or measure its audience. Cookies are files saved on your computer’s hard drive when browsing on the Internet and in particular on the site. A cookie is not used to gather your personal data without your knowing but to record information on your browsing of the site which can be read directly by Mailjet on your subsequent visits and searches on the site.

If you choose to decline acceptance of all cookies, your ability to browse certain pages of the site will be reduced.

The cookies used by Mailjet are intended to enable or facilitate communication, to enable the services requested by users to be supplied, to recognise users when they next visit, to secure payments which users may make, to register the language spoken by users or other preferences necessary for the service requested to be supplied and to enable Mailjet, internally, to carry out analyses on the hit rate on its site information pages so as to improve content, to track the email opening rate, click rate and bounce-back rates at individual level.

By default, cookies are not installed automatically (with the exception of those cookies needed to run the site and Mailjet’s services, and you are informed of their installation by a banner). In accordance with the regulations that apply, Mailjet will require your authorisation before implanting any other kind of cookie on your hard drive. To avoid being bothered by these routine requests for authorisation and to enjoy uninterrupted browsing, you can configure your computer to accept Mailjet cookies or we are able to remember your refusal or acceptance of certain cookies. Please note that without some cookies, Mailjet is unable to guarantee some services. By default, browsers accept all cookies.

When you access third party sites advertising on the Mailjet site by clicking on the ad-links or banners, or when you are reading these advertisements, cookies can be created by the companies disseminating these ads. These third parties may be able to use cookies in the context of Mailjet’s services (partners, advertisers or other third parties supplying content or services available on the Mailjet site) and are responsible for the cookies they install and it is their provisions on cookies which apply. Mailjet assumes no liability in regard to the possible use of cookies by these third parties. For more information, you are advised to check the cookie policy directly on these advertiser sites with regard to use of cookies.

### 2\. Case of data originating from third parties, collected and submitted by you in the context of using services supplied by Mailjet: Emailing campaigns and distribution lists

Mailjet has access to all the information contained in the email distribution lists you create in your account, as well as the subject and content of the emails which you send to your circulation lists via Mailjet’s services.

The data are stored on secure servers and a limited number only of people are authorised to access your distribution lists, in particular for the purpose of providing support services.

You are easily able to recover your distribution lists from your Mailjet account at any time, by clicking on the “export” button.

In no case does Mailjet sell, share or hire your distribution lists to third parties, nor does it use them for any purposes other than those set forth herein. We will use the information from your distribution lists only for legal requirements, to invoice and collect summaries for our own statistics and for the purposes of providing you with customer support services.

If you give your express consent, the use you make of your distribution lists, the subject and content of the emails you send out to them via Mailjet’s services together with the behaviour of the recipients of these emails may be analysed and tracked particularly with regard to opening rates, click rates and bounce-back rates at individual level, so as to enable you (if you are signed up for a specific Mailjet service) to refine and improve your email campaigns (behavioural marketing).

You are reminded that **as a creator of circulation lists and associated email campaigns, you are the data controller** within the meaning of European Directive 95/46/CE, Mailjet is acting here only as a provider of services. In this capacity, you are responsible in particular for:

  * making all the declarations necessary to the data protection authority in question and for complying with all current regulation on force
  * obtaining the consent of the persons concerned when collecting their personal data,
  * satisfying yourself that you have the authority to use the personal data collected in accordance with the defined end purposes and refraining from any unauthorised use.



### 3\. Data retention

Mailjet collects the data for the requirements of carrying out its contractual obligations and retains the same in active databases so long as you are a customer of and use the services of Mailjet (the contract binding us has not been cancelled) and for a further period of one (1) year after our relationship has ended, in accordance with the current regulations in force. The data on your email campaigns are retained for a period of one (1) year.

Nevertheless, Mailjet in no way undertakes to store these data indefinitely. You are able to access some of these data so long as you hold an active account with us and for a period that varies depending on the type of data concerned. The data may be deleted at any time in accordance with the provisions set forth above.

### 4\. Location of data storage and transfers

The host servers on which Mailjet processes and stores the databases are located exclusively within the European Union.

Mailjet undertakes not to transfer any data outside the European Economic Area and/or any third party country recognised by the European Commission as having an adequate level of protection.

Finally, Mailjet undertakes to inform you immediately, to the extent we are legally authorised to do so, in case of any application or order originating from an administrative or judicial authority relating to your data.

### 5\. Security

Within the framework of its services, Mailjet attributes the very highest importance to the security and integrity of its customers’ personal data.

Thus and in accordance with Directive 95/46/CE, Mailjet undertakes to take all pertinent precautions in order to preserve the security of the data and, in particular, to protect them against any accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, corruption, unauthorised circulation or access, as well as against any other form of unlawful processing or disclosure to unauthorised persons.

To this end, Mailjet implements industry standard security measures to protect personal data from unauthorised disclosure. In using industry recommended methods of encoding, Mailjet takes the measures necessary to protect information connected with payments and credit cards.

Moreover, in order to avoid in particular all unauthorised access, to guarantee accuracy and the proper use of the data, Mailjet has put the appropriate electronic, physical and managerial procedures in place with a view to safeguarding and preserving the data gathered through its services. In particular, these measures are as follows:

  * Multilevel firewalls,
  * Tried and tested anti-virus programs and unauthorised intruder attempts detection,
  * Encrypted transmission of data with SSL/https/VPN technology.



However, in spite of these, nobody is able to consider that they are completely safe against piracy or hackers. That is why in the event a breach of security were to affect you, Mailjet undertakes to inform you thereof as soon as possible and to use its best efforts to take all possible measures to neutralise the intrusion and minimise the impacts thereof. Should you suffer any loss by reason of the exploitation by a third party of a security breach, Mailjet undertakes to provide you with every assistance necessary so you are able to assert your rights and obtain reparation. Moreover if, by some exceptional case, the loss incurred arose in part due to a fault or serious negligence on the part of Mailjet, you will be able to seek compensation from Mailjet within the limit of liability referred to in Mailjet’s general terms and conditions of use.

You should keep in mind that any user, customer or hacker who discovers and takes advantage of a breach in security renders him- or herself liable to criminal prosecution and that Mailjet will take all measures, including laying a complaint and/or bringing a court action, to preserve the data and rights of its users and of itself and to limit the impact thereof to the maximum.

Generally, if you have any question whatsoever on the security of our Website, do not hesitate to contact us at [support@mailjet.com](mailto:support@mailjet.com)
