# Terms of Use & Privacy Policy

## Mainstreet Terms of Use and Privacy Policy

Welcome to the MainStreet Commerce (“MSC”) website available at “www.mainstreetcommerce.com” (this “Site”).   
This Statement discloses the Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) for this Site and describes how we collect, protect and   
use information we receive from visitors to our Site. MSC has created this Policy in order to demonstrate and   
inform you of our firm commitment to privacy. The purpose of this Policy is to outline how we deal with any   
personal data you provide to us while visiting this Site. If you do not agree, you should not use this website.   
This Policy applies only to information collected through this Site and not to information collected offline or   
through any other websites (even if affiliated with MSC).

### The Information We Collect

There are two kinds of information websites can obtain about you:

(1) Anonymous Information: “Anonymous Information” is aggregate data that websites use to administer their sites. This Anonymous Information comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, and may include such information as your browser type or your Internet Protocol (IP) address. MSC may from time to time retain third parties to help us collect and aggregate Site customer information.

IP Addresses. An IP address is unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site, avoid hacking attacks on the Site’s server, and may use it to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, even if such information is voluntarily provided by a user.

Cookie Information. As is the case with many websites, our Site uses a technology called “cookies”, which are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and allows us to tailor your visits to our Site to your individual preferences. We may also contract with third party service providers who assign cookies to conduct site tracking for us. These companies use cookies solely to provide us with aggregate data about Site traffic. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser to prevent cookies or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on our Site.

(2) Personally Identifiable Information: “Personally Identifiable Information” is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or your telephone number. Sometimes this personal information is needed when you submit a resume or when you contact us. We may ask you to provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of our Site. In particular, you may be asked to provide the following information:

Email Correspondence. Scattered throughout the Site are links or forms that can be used to contact MSC so you can comment, make a complaint, make suggestions and ask questions. Your email address is required on this form so we can answer your questions. MSC may put information from email on file, but does not currently share, sell, license or transmit this information with third parties without express authorization from you.

Newsletters, Brochures, Case Studies, Quotes and Other Communications. We may offer visitors to this Site the opportunity to sign up to receive newsletters, brochures, case studies, quotes or email communications from this Site. In order to sign up for these communications, we ask for contact information, such as name and email address. We also may offer the opportunity for you to receive mailings from our partners that we think may be of interest to you.

### How We Use Gathered Information

Anonymous Information: Anonymous Information is used internally for Site administration, troubleshooting and to help improve the quality of this Site and its design. We may share such aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, such as demographics, with existing and prospective business partners and advertisers. We never connect aggregate information with Personally Identifiable Information, and none of the Anonymous Information we share will contain any information that identifies you individually.
