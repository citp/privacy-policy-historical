<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Updated as of: May 2010</strong></p>
<h3>Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>mailVU.com is a part of the A2Stream Inc. family of businesses.  We are committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy provides our privacy practices in regards to the information we collect when you or your computer interact with our website.  By accessing <a href="http://www.mailvu.com/" class="link" title="http://mailVU.com">http://mailVU.com</a> or A2Stream's applications or widgets for social networks (including but not limited to Facebook), you acknowledge and fully understand this Privacy Policy, agree to be bound by the terms contained in this Policy, and freely consent to the information collection and use practices described in this Policy.</p>
<p>You further acknowledge and agree that you are at least 18 years old.  If you are under 18 years old you do not have permission to use this site.  We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests.</p>
<h3>Public Areas</h3>
<p>mailVU.com may make certain information such as forums and blogs available to the public.  The user must remember that all information disclosed in public areas such as forum comments or feedback comments may be publicly accessible.  We cannot control who reads your postings or what they do with the information you provide.  We encourage you to use caution when deciding to disclose personal information.  The user has both the capability, and the responsibility, to designate the recipients of their mail, and the ability to set a deletion time period.  </p>
<h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3>
<p>For premium services you need a mailVU.com user account.  When you register we request personal information which may include your name, address, phone number, email address, username, password, and other relevant information.  We may record information about your usage of our site, such as number of uploaded files and frequency and size of data transfers.</p>
<p>A2Stream may collect non-personally identifying information provided by your browser as you use the service.  Information collected may include the IP Address, the time and date of your request, and actions taken on the web site.  Additional information may include browser type and version, Internet connection type, webcam availability.  We may assign your computer one or more cookies which may collect information to facilitate access to our website and to personalize your online experience.  We may also use standard Internet tools, such as web beacons, which collect information that tracks your use of our website and enables us to customize our services and advertisements.  Information collected by mailVU.com is used to operate the services, and to further develop and improve the service.</p>
<p>A2Stream may store your information in any country.  By using the mailVU.com service you consent that A2Stream may store, process, and transfer your personal information to any country.</p>
<h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We may, from time to time, send you emails regarding our services and products.  Only mailVU.com will send you these direct mailings, and only if you have not opted out in the Preferences web page on our site.  You may change your preference at any time.</p>
<p>Testimonials posted on our web site are only placed with the expressed permission of the individual or company who provided that testimonial.</p>
<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, and logging information to a) store information so you don't have to retype it, b) provide custom, personalized content and information, c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and page views, and e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. </p>
<p>We may allow advertising companies or ad networks to display advertisements on our website.  We do not provide any personal information to these companies.  Cookies and/or web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or email communications.  You should visit those service provider's web pages to review their privacy policies.  We prohibit web beacons from being used by third parties to collect or access your personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Sharing Information with 3rd Parties</h3>
<p>We will not rent or sell your personal information to any other company or individual without your consent, except as we are required by law, or if disclosure of information is necessary to protect A2Stream, the mailVU.com users, or the general public.  We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
<p>You may provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us regarding third parties.  For instance when you share Private links with others you may provide and we collect the email addresses of the people with whom you want to share your video and resume.  We will not sell or rent Personally Identifiable Information to others, nor disclose the information to others except to the extent necessary to fulfill your service request, to protect ourselves from liability, to respond to a court order or subpoena, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company.</p>
<p>A2Stream may retain service providers to assist us with marketing, communications, and customer service initiatives.  These providers could include providers of customer support, email service providers, automated data providers, and shipping agents.  Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of A2Stream and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for A2Stream.</p>
<p>Non account holders may view your mail if you designated them as recipients. </p>
<p>We do not store your credit card or other payment information on our site.  Payment for services are made through our online transaction partner, PayPal.  Please refer to PayPal's privacy policy.</p>
<p>We may share with third parties non-personal, aggregated information, such as demographic and profile data of the user community at large. </p>

<h3>Your Choice in Selecting Privacy Settings</h3>
<p>Every Premium account holder is provided with a Preferences section on the mailVU.com web site.  It is the responsibility of each user to ensure the information is correct and current.  Users are responsible for the accuracy of their account Preferences.  You may update or correct these selections as any time by logging into your account and making the changes on the Preferences web page.  You may also leave the optional information fields blank.</p>
<p>The user has the option to opt-out of mailVU.com notifications.  This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion, support, software warnings and updates, or other administrative and transactional notices as the primary purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature.</p>
<p>The user must specify the deletion time period of each multimedia mail.  The files will be deleted from the A2Stream servers at the earlier of the user defined date/views, or the time frame associated with your account type.</p>
<h3>Access to and Accuracy of Your Information</h3>
<p>The mailVU.com site is accessible 24x7 every day of the year unless down for system maintenance.  To protect your privacy and security on Premium accounts, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring username and password, before granting access to the data.  To view and modify your personal information you may edit the selections in the Preferences page of the web site. </p>
<h3>Keeping Your Personal information Secure</h3>
<p>A2Stream takes seriously the trust you place in us.  We will keep your private data secure consistent with current industry standards.  To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, A2Stream utilizes appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect. </p>
<p>Personal information, once transmitted to us, will be stored on computers that only selected personnel and contractors have access to via password.  These computer systems are located in controlled facilities which have limited access.   Your mail messages are limited-access, where access is gained through an obscured URL system.  This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third party to guess the URL address of your content without an invitation from you including the relevant URL.  However, unless the videos and content are password protected, your invitees may forward the URL link to other parties and a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could discover your videos and/or content.</p>
<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>We may occasionally update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services.  When we do, we will also revise the Update date located at the beginning of this Policy.  We encourage you to periodically review this Policy and become aware of modifications.  If we make material changes in the way we collect, use, or share your personal information, we will notify you for sending an email to the email address you most recently provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website.  Your continued use of the mailVU.com site constitutes your agreement to this Policy and any updates.</p>
