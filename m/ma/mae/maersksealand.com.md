**Non-Personal Information**  
We collect non-personal information such as IP addresses during your use of our website to help diagnose problems with our server, and to identify ways of making our site better. This information is not linked to anything personal. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is information that a web site puts on your hard disk so that it can remember something about you at a later time. (More technically, it is information for future use that is stored by the server on the client side of a client/server communication.) We use 'cookies' to generate digital certificates that identifies the user when logging on to our interactive shipping services. 'Cookies' are also used to control the correct display of the website navigation bar.

**Live Help**  
What is Live Help? 

Live Help is an on-line user and e-business support function providing technical and business support for the Maersk Line website.

Live Help is designed to provide: 

  * on-line problem solving
  * management of customer queries
  * facilitate and ensure follow-up by the Maersk Line organisation



Live Help is not intended to negotiate or settle on-line issues of commercial or contractual nature or the like matters. However, Live Help will relay and manage such matters internally in Maersk Line to ensure follow-up - all to the benefit of our website users. 

To the benefit of our website users, we will record and keep transcripts of all communications concerning support issues raised through Live Help.

This is done only to facilitate any repeated or recurring contacts on issues addressed earlier by the individual user and for internal education and training purposes. Transscripts will be stored in a secure and confidential manner and, except as may be required to comply with prevailing law or judgments, awards, orders and the like, will be available only to Maersk Line and the concerned user. Transscripts will be stored for 7 years except where a user in writing has specifically requested for its deletion.
