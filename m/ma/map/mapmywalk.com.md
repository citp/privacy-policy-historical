* * *

 

**General Scope And Import Of Privacy Policy**   This Policy explicitly applies to any customer, user, or other person  (the “User,” “Users,” or “You”) who employ or access the MapMyFitness iMapMy mobile applications (the “Mobile Applications”), the MapMyFitness affiliated websites-www.MapMyFitness.com, MapMyRide.com, MapMyRun.com, MapMyTri.com, MapMyWalk.com, MapMyMountain.com or MapMyHike.com-(collectively, “the MapMyFitness websites” or “MapMyFitness.com”), or any other MapMyFitness products, services, features, User-generated and other MapMyFitness generated content and interactive and informational resources or promotional offers (all of the aforementioned are collectively, the “Services”).   In addition, this Policy directly applies only to the personal information and location information (as both terms are defined below) that a User discloses or transmits to MapMyFitness via the MapMyFitness websites or the Mobile Applications, or that is collected by MapMyFitness in the course of the provision of the Services.  

* * *

 

**User Consent To The Privacy Policy** By using a MapMyFitness website that displays this Policy, a User expressly agrees to the collection, use, and disclosure of certain personal information and location information as set forth in this Policy.  If a User does not consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information or location information as described in this Policy, he or she is not permitted to use the site.

**Information We Collect And How We Use It** We offer a number of Services that do not require a User to register for an account or provide any personal information or location information to us, such as MapMyFitness Basic Route Creation Tool. In order for a User to gain means of access to and use our full range of Services, he or she may be required to provide the following types of information:  

* * *

 

**Personal Information A User Provides** When a User signs up for a MapMyFitness Account or other MapMyFitness Services that require registration, we ask him or her to submit select personal information.  Personal information is any information that identifies a User personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.  Personal information may therefore include, but is not limited to: 

  * A User’s name, email address date of birth, and /or account password;
  * The phone number assigned to a User’s mobile device along with other pertinent information concerning said device, including the name of the applicable wireless carrier/provider,
  * Certain data concerning a User’s health and physical characteristics; and
  * Any content a User posts to a MapMyFitness website, as defined in the MapMyFitness Terms and Conditions of Use.

 

* * *

 

**Financial Information A User Provides** For certain Services, MapMyFitness requests a User furnish certain financial information, including but not limited to, a credit card or other payment account information that we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.  Any such financial information furnished by a User expressly falls within this Policy’s definition of personal information.  Moreover, that personal financial information is not accessible to any third parties except those specified by the User.  

* * *

 

**Location Information A User Provides** Some of the Services feature or include various location-based components.  To provide these location-based features, MapMyFitness and our partners and licensees may collect, use and share a User’s precise location information, including the real-time geographic location of a User’s mobile device. For some third-party partners, such as Google, this location information will be shared automatically. For others, such as Facebook, this information will only be shared with a User’s explicit permission or if you choose to share it..  Location information includes, but is not limited to, any information we derive in order to identify a User’s geographic position.  This information may be collected from a User’s wireless carrier, certain third party service providers, or directly from the mobile device that the User previously registered for use with MapMyFitness.  The collection and tracking of a User’s location information may occur even when the MapMyFitness mobile phone application is not actively open and running.  A User’s location information, however, is only displayed and shared in accordance with his or her established privacy settings. We may combine the personal information and/or the location information that a User submits under his or her account with information from other Services or third parties in order to provide that User  with an enhanced experience and/or to improve the overall quality of the Services.  For certain Services, we may give a User an opportunity to opt out of the combination of such information. 

* * *

 

**Other Information a User Provides** When a User employs the Services, MapMyFitness may receive certain personally non-identifiable information about the User’s use of the Services. Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies, or via submission of data by fitness devices the User may have configured to work with the Services, cannot presently be used to specifically identify the User. MapMyFitness may store such information ourselves or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers. MapMyFitness may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Services, the number of visitors to each page of the Services, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. No personal information is available or used in this process.  

* * *

 

**Aggregated Information** To better serve Users and improve the Services, MapMyFitness may conduct research on User demographics, interests and behavior based on the personal information and other information provided to MapMyFitness. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated information with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify a User personally. MapMyFitness may also disclose aggregated information in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.  

* * *

 

**Cookies** When a User visits MapMyFitness.com, We send one or more cookies-small text files that contain a string of characters-to a User’s computer that uniquely identify his or her browser.  Cookies do not identify a User personally, but these files are linked with other information that could personally identify a User.  More importantly, cookies permit MapMyFitness to offer a User more personalized Services and online experiences.  In addition, we use cookies to improve the quality of The Services by storing User preferences and tracking User trends, such as how people search.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but a User can reset his or her browser to reject all cookies or to provide an alert when a cookie is being sent.  Some MapMyFitness features and Services, however, may not function properly if a User has disabled cookies.

**MapMyFitness Privacy Settings and Online Disclosures** MapMyFitness provides its Users with three privacy setting options for their accounts-”Public,” “Friends Only,” and “Private.” These privacy settings control who can view a User’s online disclosures, including certain Users personal information and location information.   MapMyFitness sets User default privacy settings to “Friends Only.” A “Friends Only” privacy setting limits access to a User’s online disclosures. Only certain personal information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness via the MapMyFitness Websites and/or the Mobile Applications—specifically, MapMyFitness user name, first name and first initial of the last name, and any profile picture or associated with a MapMyFitness User—while that User maintains a “Friends Only” privacy setting, is disclosed or accessible to the general public. All other personal information and/or location information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness is only disclosed to and accessible by only those persons who that User has previously designated as “Friends” and MapMyFitness.   A “Private” privacy setting further limits access to the personal information and location information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness via the MapMyFitness Websites and/or the Mobile Applications.  Specifically, no personal information or location information that a User discloses and or transmits to MapMyFitness while that User maintains a “Private” privacy setting, is disclosed to, or accessible by, that User’s Friends or the general public. Said information is only disclosed to and accessible by the User and MapMyFitness.   To permit the general public or any third parties, including other Users, to view a User’s online disclosures, a User must actively and specifically employ a “Public” privacy setting; save his or her routes as “Public”; or otherwise use or access Services that require a User to make use of a “Public” privacy setting. Further, a User should be aware that certain personal information or location information that he or she voluntarily discloses online by means of his or her employment of Services that require a “Public” privacy setting may become publicly available and could be read, collected, and/or used by third parties, including other Users, in ways unknown to MapMyFitness. MapMyFitness is not responsible for any such use of a User’s personal information or location information by any third party. MapMyFitness therefore recommends that a User actively manage his or her privacy settings on an ongoing basis, so that he or she can effectively guard against the unauthorized use or abuse of his or her personal information or location information by others.

**Log File Information** When a User accesses or uses the Services, our servers automatically record information from that User’s mobile device and web browser.  These server logs may include, but are not limited to, information such as a User’s web requests, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of that User’s request, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, cookies that may uniquely identify a User’s browser, and elements employed in the Mobile Applications.

**User Communications** When a User sends an email or other communication to MapMyFitness, we may retain those communications in order to process that User’s inquiry, respond to his or her request, and improve the Services.

Personal information that a User provides to a Partner or its affiliated website may be sent to MapMyFitness in order to deliver the Services.

* * *

 

**Other sites** This Privacy Policy applies to the affiliated websites and the Services that are owned and operated by MapMyFitness.  We do not exercise control over the third party websites displayed as search results or links from within our various Services.  These other third party websites may place their own cookies or other files on a User’s computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from a User.   The links from the Services do not imply our review or endorsement of the third party websites.  We encourage Users to contact those third party websites directly for information concerning their privacy practices.

**Third-Party Advertisers And Ad-Serving Companies** Advertisements that appear on MapMyFitness are sometimes delivered (or “served”) directly to Users by third-party advertisers or ad network companies (collectively, the “Third Party Advertisers “).  Third Party Advertisers may automatically receive a User’s IP address or other information about his or her mobile device or personal computer when serving advertisements.  They may also download cookies to a User’s computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” to measure the effectiveness of the advertisements served and to personalize advertising content.  Doing this allows the advertiser or ad network to recognize a User’s computer or mobile device each time he or she sends a User an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of the ad and to personalize advertising content.  Further, Third Party Advertisers may use aggregated information (not including User’s name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the MapMyFitness websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to Users.

**Security** When a User logs in to MapMyFitness and its affiliated websites, we require that a secure connection between a User’s computer and our server be established.  We use a technology called Secure Socket Layers (SSL), an encryption technology that works with most browsers.  A secure connection is maintained until a User leaves the secure area of one of a MapMyFitness website.  Although we use SSL encryption to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information as it travels via the Internet, ironclad security does not exist on the Internet, and accordingly, we cannot guarantee the safety of the transmission of any personal information over the Internet.  

* * *

 

**Changes To The Policy** Please note that the Policy may change at any time and without prior notice.  Any revised version(s) of the Policy will be promptly posted on the MapMyFitness affiliated websites. We will not reduce User rights under the Policy without each User’s explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be negligible.  To better inform Users of changes to the Policy, we will post any such changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification).  Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of Our Privacy Policy in an archive for review by Users. A User’s continued use of the Services constitutes his or her agreement to this Policy and any future revisions.
