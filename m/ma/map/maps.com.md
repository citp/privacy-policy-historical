# Maps.com - Privacy Policy

**Maps.com Privacy Policy**

  


Maps.com is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors and customers. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information. 

**Visitor Information**  
During the process of delivering mapping content to you, Maps.com does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Maps.com does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). This data helps Maps.com understand the optimal web design to provide a maximum viewing experience. 

**Maps.com Customer/Club Information**  
In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to Maps.com Club or to make a map purchase. In this instance Maps.com collects personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Maps.com will not share any customer personal information with third-parties. What this means is that your personal information will not be shared or sold to other web sites. Additionally, Maps.com has internal security measures to minimize access to customer data for you protection. 

**Maps.com Customer Data**  
It is Maps.com pledge that customer data will only be used to gain a better understanding of what products and services our customers are interested in. For example if you share that you are interested in educational products while signing-up for Maps.com Club we may contact you when a new educational geography is launched. 

**Cookie Use**  
Maps.com, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to enhance your web experience. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you for various reasons throughout a web visit (saving passwords is one use). This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps Maps.com provide a better service experience. 

**Banner Advertising**  
Maps.com works with L90 for banner advertising. L90 uses one or more third party ad serving technology to serve ads at this site and at our clients' sites. In the course of delivering an ad to you, the third party ad serving party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser and use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this non-personally-identifiable information used to serve ads to you, please click here. 

**Cookies and Opt Out**   
Like most Internet sites, L90 and its third party ad serving party uses "cookies" to enhance the Internet user's experience on the Web. Neither L90 nor such third party ad serving party uses these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files. 

**What are cookies and how do they enhance your Web experience?**   
A cookie is a unique number that is assigned to you the first time you are served an ad. This number is stored in a file on your computer. For instance, cookies help ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same ad. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site and the effectiveness of an ad. This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to your needs. In other words, cookies help us deliver to you the types of ads in which you are more interested. 

Although we believe that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web (by not repeatedly serving the same ads to you and delivering more relevant messages to you), neither L90 nor its third party ad serving party needs cookies to deliver ads to you. 

**Opt Out**   
If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. In order to "opt out" of the benefits of cookies, you may either manually de-lete your cookies by following the instructions contained in the Help section of your browser.
