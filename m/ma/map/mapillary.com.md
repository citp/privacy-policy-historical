# Privacy Policy | Mapillary'

We respect your right to privacy and will only process your personal information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.

In this Privacy Policy, "we," "us," "its" and "our" refer to Mapillary AB ("Mapillary"), organized under the laws of Sweden. Please read carefully this Privacy Policy ("Policy") relating to your submission of Content to and use of Mapillary applications, services and websites. Other terms used with a capital initial letter are defined in the associated [Terms of Use](https://www.mapillary.com/terms).

A. Introduction

This Policy explains how Mapillary collects, stores, uses and discloses information from you when you submit Content to and use Mapillary products, services, mobile applications and websites. This Policy applies to users of the Mapillary "Service", defined as the services, APIs, and functionality we make available either through our website at _www.mapillary.com_ and related site pages (the "Website"), via private sites or repositories, or through third party sites that utilize our services and functionality, as well as through our mobile application (the "App"). This Policy does not apply to websites, applications, or services that do not display or link to this Policy or that display or link to different privacy statements; nor does this Policy apply to practices of companies that we do not control or to people we do not employ or manage.

By accepting the Policy during account registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information and non-personal information as described in this Policy and to all other terms herein.

It may be possible for you to browse certain parts of the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information that enables us to directly identify you as an individual. However, you may lose anonymity once you give us personal information about you, and by doing so, you agree to the collection, transfer and storage of that information to our servers and to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In particular and as applicable, this applies to any personal data you voluntarily submit in your bio/profile page and the geolocation data indexed to photos submitted.

B. Information Collected

We collect information in various ways when you use our Service and as set forth in the Terms of Use. Some of this information may be Personal Data about you. As used in this Policy, "Personal Data" means any information (either alone or in combination with other information we hold) that specifically may be used to identify or identifies you as an individual, such as your name, address and physical location, account numbers, email addresses, or telephone numbers. These are examples and please note that you are not requested to submit all of this information but may choose to do so. If there is data that could be understood as Personal Data included in Content, i.e. faces of individuals or license plates of vehicles, these data are automatically blurred to avoid any identification of individuals before posting on Mapillary. As this is an automated process, we welcome any requests or comments if there is something we missed by e-mail to [complaints@mapillary.com](mailto:complaints@mapillary.com) .

As well as Personal Data, we also collect some information that is not personally identifying, including aggregate information, which is data we collect about use of the Service or about a group or category of users from which it is not possible to identify you (“Nonpersonal Data”; together with Personal Data, collectively "Information"). 

_Personal Data_

When you register for an account, and in the course of your use of the Service, we collect the following Personal Data: your log-in information (username and password), email address, any profile or biographical information you elect to provide, to the extent revealed in your Content (as that term is defined in the Mapillary Terms of Use), and, if applicable, financial information, including credit card and/or bank account numbers, that you provide to us in exchange for your commercial use of the Service as agreed in writing separately between us. Also geolocation data is collected and indexed to submitted photos to enable the Mapillary functionality.

_Nonpersonal_ _Data_

When you use our Service, we automatically collect Nonpersonal Data sent to us by your computer, mobile device or other access device, such as a device ID or unique identifier, device type, model and brand, geo-location information, computer, network and connection information, internet protocol (IP) address, access times, operating system and browser version, type and language, and the website you visited before our Website. We also collect Nonpersonal Data about your usage and activity on the Service, and in the form of Metadata (as that term is defined in the Mapillary Terms of Use). This Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of Nonpersonal Data.

C. Our Use of Information

We may use and provide data and information to our partners and customers for commercial purposes after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. We use Information collected through our Service for the purposes and as described in this Policy, as disclosed to you on our App, as needed to carry out the Service, and as set forth in the Terms of Use. We may also use your Information to:

(i) operate, maintain, customize, measure and improve our Service, and to fulfill the purposes disclosed when you provided your information to us;

(ii) respond to your comments and questions and provide the Service and customer support you request;

(iii) resolve disputes, collect fees, enforce our terms and policies, and troubleshoot problems;

(iv) understand user preferences to enhance your experience and enjoyment using our Service;

(v) communicate with you about new events, offers and other news about our products and services offered by us and, as applicable, our selected partners; and

(vi) send you Services-related information, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages.

We also may combine your Information with information we collect from other sources to improve our products and services. Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) may be exposed to public search engines and publicly available search results and via third party sites and applications that access the Service. Nothing in this Privacy Policy should be construed to prevent us from charging a fee to parties who wish to access Content or to use the Service (although access to the Service for Non-Commercial Use, as defined in the Terms of Use, is free of charge).

You have the option of submitting Content and using the Service anonymously as the user name and e-mail address you submit may certainly be created specifically to avoid identifying you as an individual. If you do not submit a valid e-mail address however, this may interfere with your use of the Service through i.a. loss of relevant notifications. However, we cannot guarantee absolute anonymity and make no guarantee that other users will never be able to determine your identity, such as (without limitation) by observations of your activity, the manner in which you express yourself, and other patterns of conduct or behavior. Moreover, all of your activities on the Service will be traceable to your username, from which your actual identity may be known. Notices may be sent to other users regarding suspicious activity and policy violations and refer to usernames and specific items. Please understand that if you link your name with your username or e-mail address, others will be able to personally identify your activities.

Further, we may use personal information to respond to legal requirements, in connection with a merger, sale of assets, or other similar corporate transactions, to respond to claims that Content violates the rights of others, or to protect the rights, property, or safety or any person.

_Your choices regarding our use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes_

If you no longer wish to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in any such message, by emailing us at [complaints@mapillary.com](mailto:complaints@mapillary.com) . We aim to comply with such request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you administrative messages; you cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.

D. Sharing Information

We do not disclose, sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties for their marketing purposes without your prior consent. If you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity. We only share your Personal Data as follows:

(ii) with service providers, consultants or similar contractors, or third parties who provide services or content in connection with our Service in order to support or enhance our products and services or our business operations, or to make available and consummate initiated transactions;

(iii) to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to enforce or apply our terms of use/service, license terms, or other agreements between us, and to protect the rights, safety and property of Mapillary, our agents, employees customers, members, and others; and

(iv) under written obligations of confidentiality, in connection with or during negotiation of any a merger, financing, acquisition, or dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.

We may also share and disclose Nonpersonal Data for the same purposes as described above.

E. No Guarantee of Security

We take all reasonable steps to help protect your Personal Data in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no one can create a completely secure website, app or service and third parties may unlawfully intercept, steal or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your Information or private communications that you transfer over the internet to us will always be secure or remain confidential.

F. Password

Your password deserves careful thought and protection. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your password to anyone. You shall not share your password or your personal sign-in credentials with others, and please remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately access your profile to change your password and notify us immediately at [ hello@mapillary.com ](mailto:hello@mapillary.com).

G. International Transfers

We may process Information on servers located in a number of countries. Accordingly, we may share Information with our service providers and affiliated companies for such companies to carry out any of the activities specified in this Policy. We may also subcontract processing to or share Information with third parties located in countries other than your home country. Information collected within the European Economic Area and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to, and processed by our affiliates or other third parties identified above that are located in, a country outside of the EEA and Switzerland, where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your information. However, we will only process your information as described in this Policy in every country.

H. Children

The Services are not directed at or intended for children under thirteen (13) years of age, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from such children.

I. Policy Changes

We may amend this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will post the amended terms on Mapillary.com, change the "Last Updated" date, and where appropriate, notify you by email.

J. Your Information and Choices

You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing or promotional purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You may also opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in the emails themselves or by emailing [ hello@mapillary.com ](mailto:hello@mapillary.com). If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations.

You can see, review and change your personal information by logging into the Service or by contacting us at [ hello@mapillary.com ](mailto:hello@mapillary.com). You should promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. You also may send requests about your contact preferences, to request a review of the Personal Data we have about you, and to request we update or correct any out-of-date or incorrect Personal Data we have about you (to the extent of Personal Data we have not already made available to you for your own review, modification, or deletion). Upon receipt and process of a reasonable opt-out request, we will, within a commercially reasonable period of time, comply with such request to the extent reasonable. Note that requests to terminate disclosure to third parties may frustrate or render impossible our ability to provide the Service or conduct transactions initiated by you.

You may deactivate your account any time. Deactivation is your sole means of terminating your account. Upon your deactivation, your profile page (with a notice that your account has been deactivated) will per default still be visible after deactivation, and all your posted Content will still be accessible. You may however enter your account and delete the Personal Data information you do not wish to have on Mapillary and change your username to a generic one thus making also this this data Nonpersonal, if not already. You may also request that we delete your Personal Data and change your e-mail address to a generic designation, such as “12345” making also this information Nonpersonal. Once we have changed, or effectively deleted the valid e-mail address you originally submitted, you cannot access the account or make any additional changes. We will in our own discretion keep Nonpersonal Data and explicitly the photos submitted and the associated geolocation data which is required, if any, to maintain the uninterrupted and intended Mapillary Solution functionality.

In addition to the above, you may opt-out of providing information via the App to Mapillary at any time by uninstalling the App using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or store.

Please note that once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. In addition to the foregoing, we retain personal information from deactivated accounts, if and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our agreements and policies, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law or as specified elsewhere in this Policy. Normally however, the immediately preceding statement is not applicable and the only data we retain are the photos submitted, any comments thereto and the associated geolocation data which is required, if any, to maintain the uninterrupted and intended Mapillary Solution functionality.
