                <li><strong>What information does Mapping Your Future collect about you?</strong>
                  <p>Mapping Your Future gathers information from you in order to help us  design our website to better meet your needs and to make the financial aid  process easier for you. Mapping Your Future does not share your personally  identifying information with third-party marketers. We gather and retain  information in the following ways:<br>
                  </p><blockquote><p><strong>When you're viewing the site:</strong><br><br>
                      When you view the Mapping Your Future site, we identify which  browser you're using, where you linked from and to, and which part of the site  you viewed. We keep statistics about the use of our site to determine ways to  make the site better. Identifying your IP (Internet Protocol) address helps  diagnose problems with the server and to administer the site.

Your question or comment may be sent to the appropriate person (such  as a customer service representative at a sponsoring agency or to technical  staff) for response or to make revisions to the site.</p>

                    <!--p> <strong>When you're participating in a chat event:</strong> <br /><br />
                    Mapping Your Future periodically hosts chat events. Please remember that  any information you disclose in the chat event becomes public information and  you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal  information.</p-->
                    <p> <strong>When you're participating in Online Counseling:</strong><br><br>
                    When you complete an Online Counseling session, you  are asked to provide your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, Social  Security number, birth date, the name of the school you're attending, and  possibly information for your parent, spouse, next of kin, expected employer,  and references. This information may be shared with your school, lender, and/or  guarantor to verify that you have completed counseling, though for a limited  period of time. Those entities may share your information with other  organizations as authorized under routine uses in the appropriate system of records and  as may be authorized or required by federal regulations. </p>
                    <p>If  you do not wish to provide this information online, you must contact your  school to request an alternative method of fulfilling your counseling  obligation.</p>
                    <p> <strong>When you're participating in MappingXpress:</strong><br><br>
                    When you complete a MappingXpress session, you are asked to provide your name, birth date, and other identifying information your school has selected. This information may be shared with your school to verify you have uploaded documents through the MappingXpress service. Your school may share your information with other organizations as authorized under routine uses in the appropriate system of records and as may be authorized or required by federal regulations.</p>
                    <p> <strong>When you subscribe to a Mapping Your Future  newsletter:</strong> <br>
                      <br>
                  When you sign up for a Mapping Your Future newsletter, we collect e-mail  address, and in some cases, your state, which is added to Mapping Your Future's  subscriber database.

                  This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse,  and alteration of the information we gather. When you provide personal data  during Online Counseling or other services offered by Mapping Your Future, the information is encrypted prior to  transfer.

                <li><strong>What       is the security of the sites to which Mapping Your Future links?</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  The Mapping Your Future site contains links to other sites. Mapping Your  Future is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you link to a non-Mapping Your Future site, you become subject to  that site's privacy policy and terms and conditions of use. Mapping Your Future  encourages you to become familiar with any external party's privacy policy  before disclosing personal information.<br>
                  <br></li>
                <li><strong>What       are Mapping Your Future's guidelines for children?</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  Mapping Your Future provides some educational information specifically  targeted for children, such as information on making career choices. We do not  intend to collect personally identifying information from children under 13  years of age. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information  from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly take all reasonable measures  to delete the data from our system. No information collected from children is  used for any marketing purposes whatsoever. Mapping Your Future encourages parents and guardians to spend time  online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered  on the site.<br>
                  <br>
                  Mapping Your Future doesn't intentionally share personally identifying  information obtained from children under the age of 18 with the exception of  borrowers under the age of 18 who complete Online Counseling.<br><br></li>
                <li><strong>How       do I correct information I have submitted to Mapping Your Future?</strong><br>
