# Privacy Policy

Our basic policy is that we want out customers to have quality mapping tools that meet their needs. We do occasionally make mistakes and every now and then a product that doesn't meet our quality standards slips out. Please let us know if there is a problem, we want to get it right. Once your needs are met, we won't flood you with marketing emails to buy more stuff. We expect that as a satisfied customer you'll return when you next have a need for our products.

## Your Privacy

At MapTools.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and nothing else. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

#### What information do we collect? How do we use it?

When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. 

#### Will MapTools.com disclose the information it collects to outside parties?

MapTools.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

#### How does MapTools.com protect customer information?

When you place orders or access your account information it is through an encrypted connection to our server. Your credit card information is encrypted before it is stored in our database and it is deleted once we have processed the charge. We are moving to a new credit card processor and once that's completed we will not store your credit card data at all. There are only two of us here at MapTools, so we think it is unlikely that there will be a theft of data by an insider. We use strong passwords to protect access to our servers. And we work hard to keep up with current security practices. 

## Returns and Refunds

We want you to have quality tools that are right for the task at hand. If that's not what happened, we want to know. We'll gladly exchange tools so you get the right one. We gladly issue a refund, if you just want to return your purchase. Often we will not even want you to return the product. They just don't cost enough to get all worked up over returning a small plastic card, and we'll just send you a replacement. For larger orders and more expensive items, we'll usually want the product back. If it's our error that let to the problem we'll cover the return shipping. If the error or change comes from your end, we would ask that you cover the return shipping.

We try to keep our policies short and simple. There is room for abuse, but thus far it's not been a problem. We don't want to ever have to write pages of legalese which you have to "agree to" before ordering. Please help us keep it that way by working with us to solve any problems you have. We're just people too. And we're working hard doing what we love to do.
