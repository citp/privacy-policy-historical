# MapQuest : Privacy Policy

What personally identifiable information does MapQuest.com collect from me?  
MapQuest.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of Web sites. 

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, MapQuest.com asks for your name, email address, and other personal information. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to MapQuest.com and are able to take full advantage of MapQuest.com's many offerings. 

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by MapQuest.com and/or our many partners; when you make a purchase at MapQuest.com's store; when you make travel arrangements using MapQuest.com; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. MapQuest.com also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for internal research. Wherever MapQuest.com collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

How does MapQuest.com use my information?  
MapQuest.com's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, MapQuest.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. 

In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, MapQuest.com plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). MapQuest.com takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only MapQuest.com has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email. You will only receive special offers via email from MapQuest.com if you have indicated during registration that you would like to receive them. You can change your preferences at any time. 

MapQuest.com does internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, or from our server log files. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. 

Who is collecting information?  
When you are on a MapQuest.com site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information for use by MapQuest.com alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. Some MapQuest.com services may be offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this service to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. In such cases you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

Promotions that run on MapQuest.com may be sponsored by companies other than MapQuest.com or may be cosponsored by MapQuest.com and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. Currently, most MapQuest.com promotions are limited to US or North American residents. 

Please be aware that MapQuest.com advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to MapQuest.com are not covered by this privacy statement. 

With whom does MapQuest.com share my information? As a general rule, MapQuest.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. 

Business Partners & Sponsors: MapQuest.com may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Some or all data collected during a MapQuest.com promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. 

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give MapQuest.com permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. 

MapQuest.com Store: If you make a purchase from a MapQuest.com store the information obtained during your visit to the store, and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, may be provided to a merchant if necessary to process your transaction. 

Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, MapQuest.com may match user information with third party data. Also, MapQuest.com discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

Other: MapQuest.com may also disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) MapQuest.com's rights or property, other MapQuest.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. MapQuest.com may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?  
If you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from MapQuest.com and our partners, we may occasionally send you e-mail or postal mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only MapQuest.com (or agents working on behalf of MapQuest.com and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. 

Or, at any time you can easily edit your MapQuest.com registration information to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your MapQuest.com username and password in order to access your MapQuest.com registration information. 

On some types of MapQuest.com promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you may automatically receive promotion-related email. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements. 

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those MapQuest.com services that require the use of cookies in order to participate. These services may include (but are not limited to): My MapQuest and the MapQuest store. 

MapQuest.com does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests. 

What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?  
Your MapQuest.com registration information is password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your MapQuest.com registration information by using your MapQuest.com username and password. 

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. MapQuest.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. We recommend that you should not ask MapQuest.com to remember your username or password on a computer that can be accessed by others. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, MapQuest.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any registration information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
