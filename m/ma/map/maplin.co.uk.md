We also use cookies to help build a personal profile of your online habits, interests and activities as you navigate our site, which we use for general research, analysis and reporting. We mostly use "session cookies" that are automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies from our Site can't be read by other sites.

**HOW DO WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?**   


We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.   


**HOW LONG DO WE KEEP USER INFORMATION?**   


We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for about one (1) year. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements.

In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. 

Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.
