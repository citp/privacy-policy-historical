Maplesoft uses this information to better serve all visitors as we improve the content and design of the Services, and to enhance the convenience of using the Services by reducing redundant information entry for Users.

The default setting on most web browsers is to accept cookies. You can change this setting to refuse any cookie, or to be prompted when a cookie is being sent. Please note, however, that some areas and features of the Services will not function properly if you refuse cookies.

**Commercial E-mail Communications**  
Maplesoft operates multiple commercial e-mail lists that interested parties can opt-in or opt-out of at any time from the [e-mail management area](https://web.archive.org/subscribers/subscription_list.aspx) of the Web Site. If you are a member of the Web Site, you can also manage your preferences from within the [Member Center](https://web.archive.org/Members/member_center_main.aspx). The personal information required to subscribe to each list varies. 

From time to time, Maplesoft may create new commercial mailing lists and may pre-populate these lists from existing user information contained within our databases. You may be added to an initial list of subscribers for a new list unless you have added your name to the _global unsubscription_ list.

You may still subscribe to any Maplesoft e-mail offering after globally opting-out, and by doing so you will be removed from the global unsubscription list. 

E-mail messages verifying opt-in and opt-out requests are automatically sent to the recipient after each transaction. 

**Non-Commercial E-mail Communications**  
Maplesoft periodically sends non-commercial information and technical updates to customers and that these communications cannot be opted-out of. 

**Safeguarding Security**

Maplesoft will apply these principles regardless of the specific technologies employed for data collection and use.
