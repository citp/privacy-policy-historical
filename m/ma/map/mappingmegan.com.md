## [The Best Destinations for Whale Watching Around the World](https://www.mappingmegan.com/best-destinations-for-whale-watching-around-the-world/)

Whale watching became a trend in the 1980’s, as a way to try and influence the debate over whaling. Back then the concept of whale watching was written off as a ‘stupid idea’, but nowadays it’s anything but.

In trying to change the social acceptance of whale hunts, a group of fairly savvy conservationists realized that there is nothing more remarkable than seeing a whale in the wild, and saw a world where whales would be more valuable to an economy alive, than hunted.

Ever since then, whale watching has grown into a 2.1 billion dollar industry, and almost every country with a coastline has jumped in on the action.

While it was conservationists who pioneered the whale watching tourism trend, researcher Roger Payne credits only one group for the development of whale watching: the whales themselves.

Described as nature’s best self‐publicists, whale watching is now taken seriously as an economic activity globally. So, do take a look at this list before booking your whale watching holidays.

We’ve well and truly entered an age of female empowerment, and as far as 2019 is concerned, I’m dubbing this the year of the wander woman.

Over the past few years women have tipped the scales to become the majority of travelers over men. We’re taking more active adventures, and saying no to sipping cocktails on the beach. And we’re not letting age be a limiting factor (the world is now being taken OVER by amazing traveling grandmas).

Some women are doing it solo, some are traveling with their families, and some are dragging along their husbands (lucky guys!). Some have quit their jobs and sold everything, while others travel while holding down a job and a mortgage.

Women these days who want to travel aren’t letting anyone tell them how it should be done, they’re making their journey their own. But even better, they’re writing about it to inspire the rest of us.

If you’re looking for a great travel memoir to add to your summer reading list, make sure you pick up one of these; brand new titles from kick ass women who haven’t been afraid to follow their dreams.

I’ve been absolutely captivated by their stories!

In the Indonesian archipelago, between the islands of Sumbawa and Flores, lies Komodo National Park. It’s the only place on Earth you can have a close encounter with a Komodo dragon, a unique lizard species often referred to as the last living dinosaur.

In an effort to conserve this rare creature and its natural habitat, the Komodo National Park is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park consists of three major islands (Komodo, Rinca and Padar) that are home to over 2500 of these impressive and fearsome creatures.

Though Komodo is much more than it’s famous wildlife; the islands also boast some of the world’s best diving and snorkelling spots, and landscapes so dramatic the island was recently named one of the world’s “7 New Wonders of Nature.”

With a new airport in Labuan Bajo, on the neighbouring island of Flores, access to Komodo is now just a boat ride away. Here are just five of the many reasons you’ll want to discover the magic this Indonesian gem has to offer.

When you travel to another country, it’s good practice to be vigilant and aware of your surroundings to keep yourself safe from possible threats. But what about online threats?

Did you know that when you travel to other countries, in many cases, you are more vulnerable to online threats than you are at home?

For many of us, when we connect to the Internet, we don’t think at all about how we’re connecting. We just do. The devices we use even connect themselves to the Internet sometimes, for all kinds of things like backups and automatic updates.

While that’s just the nature of the way we live now, it doesn’t mean you don’t need to be careful to protect yourself and your information. Because most internet connections we used by travelers are open public networks, this puts our personal data at risk.

Abstinence has never been a practical solution, so the one way to solve this is by using one of the best free VPNs. Here’s why you need to be traveling with a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for the sake of your data.

The Internet and its uses are wondrous. And you may think that no matter where you are in the world, you can access whatever you want as long as you there is an available internet connection, right?

Unfortunately, that’s wrong.

While the internet might hold the answer to everything, there are actually a lot of restrictions and legalities involved with what kinds of content you’ll be able to access in specific parts of the world.

Not every country believes in providing free and open internet to their citizens, and you might find when traveling that your internet access is limited, and the government has blocked certain websites.

This means that if you’re traveling internationally, you might want to do a little research and prepare yourself for the browsing and streaming complications that might arise while you’re on your trip.

LA is one of those iconic destinations that every traveler should experience at least once in their lifetime; a sprawling urban metropolis that is deeply creative, and bursting at the seams with culture, personality, and access to Mother nature.

Whatever draws you to LA, whether it be laying underneath palm trees on a golden coast, the glitz of Hollywood, upmarket bars and boutiques, or lacing up your hiking boots for treks across the rugged mountains, LA truly has something for everyone.

But with such a huge range of experiences, in a city more than ten times the size of Paris, the most difficult part of planning isn’t going to be figuring out what to include on your itinerary; it’s going to be how to maximize your time.

For that reason alone we highly recommend renting a car.

My first ever trip overseas was to Japan when I was 15. It was a language immersion trip with my High School, and my name was pulled out of a hat for one of the coveted places.

And while this introduction to travel involved many cultural highlights like attendance at a local school, a homestay with a Japanese student, and traveling to Hiroshima to place 1,000 cranes, the one day I was most looking forward to was Tokyo Disneyland.

Fastforward 15 years, and I would find myself traveling back to Tokyo, with the sole purpose of visiting Tokyo DisneySea®. And, in a country where embracing worlds of fantasy is part of the cultural fabric, I discovered the same sense of pure joy and wonder as I had felt at age 15.

Tokyo DisneySea is an incredible theme park inspired by the myths and legends of the sea. And in the lead up to my trip, fellow adults would lose their composure and absolutely gush about how incredible their time at the park had been.

In the fierce debate about the best Disney park in the world, I feel confident awarding the title to Tokyo DisneySea. Here’s why.
