The Services use "cookies" to record basic information entered on some forms and to record "shopping baskets" in the Web Store. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. Maplesoft uses this information to better serve all visitors as we improve the content and design of the Services, and to enhance the convenience of using the Services by reducing redundant information entry for Users.

The default setting on most web browsers is to accept cookies. You can change this setting to refuse any cookie, or to be prompted when a cookie is being sent. Please note, however, that some areas and features of the Services will not function properly if you refuse cookies.

**Email Communications** **  
**  
Maplesoft operates multiple commercial subscription-based email lists that interested parties can opt-in or opt-out of at any time from the [email management area](http://www.maplesoft.com/subscribers/subscription_list.aspx) of the Maplesoft web site. If you are a member of Maplesoft.com, you can also manage your preferences from within the [Member Center](http://www.maplesoft.com/Members/member_center_main.aspx). 

From time to time, Maplesoft may create new subscription-based commercial email lists and may pre-populate these lists with existing Maplesoft email list subscribers, based on subscriber profiles. If you are not already a Maplesoft email subscriber, you will not be added to any newly created Maplesoft email lists. 

If you are a Maplesoft customer, and/or you have communicated with Maplesoft within the past 2 years, you may periodically receive emails from Maplesoft staff or from a Maplesoft email account ending with @maplesoft.com, including emails such as new product updates, security updates, technical updates, customer service updates, and other commercial email communications considered relevant to you, based on your customer or contact profile. 

If you would prefer to never receive commercial emails from Maplesoft, you have the option to remove yourself from all present and future email lists by globally unsubscribing [here ](http://www.maplesoft.com/subscribers/global_unsubscribe.aspx). You may still subscribe to any Maplesoft email list after globally unsubscribing, and by doing so you will be removed from the global unsubscribe list and put on the list(s) that you subscribe to.

Emails verifying opt-in and opt-out requests are automatically sent to the recipient after each email subscription update. 

**Safeguarding Security**  
Maplesoft will take appropriate steps to ensure that personal information is protected from unauthorized access and disclosure, including limited access to such data only to those employees with a business need to know. Maplesoft will apply these principles regardless of the specific technologies employed for data collection and use.
