(As used in this policy, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, mapsdrivingdirections.org or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to mapsdrivingdirections.org, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, photo, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). mapsdrivingdirections.org may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to mapsdrivingdirections.org or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from mapsdrivingdirections.org or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to mapsdrivingdirections.org. 

1.2 Third Party List Information. 

mapsdrivingdirections.org may collect information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and mapsdrivingdirections.org subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, mapsdrivingdirections.org seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to mapsdrivingdirections.org and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list. 

1.3 Other Information. 

Other occasions when mapsdrivingdirections.org obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by mapsdrivingdirections.org or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through mapsdrivingdirections.org's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a mapsdrivingdirections.org service or newsletter (together, "Other Information"). 

1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.

(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows mapsdrivingdirections.org to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in mapsdrivingdirections.org's database.

(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function (see http://truste.org

This allows mapsdrivingdirections.org to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, mapsdrivingdirections.org might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in mapsdrivingdirections.org's database, visits the baseball website, mapsdrivingdirections.org receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and mapsdrivingdirections.org would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. mapsdrivingdirections.org may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, mapsdrivingdirections.org also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in mapsdrivingdirections.org's database. 

(c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including search engine indexing, cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is mapsdrivingdirections.org's use of new and evolving technology.
