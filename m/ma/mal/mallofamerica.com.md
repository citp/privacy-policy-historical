  1. **Types of Information MOA Collects**




We collect two basic types of information – Personal Information and Anonymous Information.  We may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information – Aggregate Information.

**_Personal Information_** **.** There are several places where MOA gives you an opportunity to provide MOA your Personal Information. MOA may ask you to provide Personal Information when you engage in certain activities on a Site or an App, such as: utilizing the MOA WiFi services; signing up for the Mall of America newsletter; participating in social media activities involving third-party providers such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, Swarm, or Yelp, whether at this Site or the social media websites; filling out a survey; sending feedback; downloading, installing or using an App; registering for sweepstakes or contests; or using a cell phone send text messages to or call MOA.

If you choose to share any Personal Information with MOA, you will see that the amount and type of Personal Information MOA requests depends on how you use the corresponding Site. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, the information MOA asks you to provide will be identified as mandatory or voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

While you can generally browse a Site without informing MOA about who you are or revealing Personal Information about yourself, MOA is still able to determine your IP address, which will reveal your location to MOA.  MOA may use your IP address, together with other Personal Information that you may provide to us, such as your email address, to communicate with you directly about products and services that MOA believes may be of interest based on your activity on a Site.

**_Anonymous Information_** **.**   In general, you can browse a Site without telling MOA who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.  MOA, however, collects your computer’s and/or mobile device’s IP address, which you necessarily disclose when you visit a Site or download or use an App so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to your computer or mobile device.  The Sites and/or Apps may utilize Cookies.  MOA may use Cookie data to recognize you when you visit a Site or use an App in the future, to troubleshoot how a Site or an App operates, and for internal analysis of how people use a Site or an App.  Should you decide not to accept Cookies from a Site or an App, you will limit the functionality MOA can provide you. 

**_Aggregate Information_** **.** We may occasionally use Google Analytics and/or other third-party data analytics tools to (i) monitor traffic on our Sites or Apps, (ii) use of Mall of America’s WiFi service, and (iii) use of Mall of America App and other software applications. Such tools help us to provide the kind of ‎user-friendly, up-to-date information that online users expect to find. Personal Information is not monitored or collected through this process.

**_Participation in Activities_** **.**   When you engage in certain activities on a Site or an App, such as by registering or logging in as a user of an App or sending MOA a message using a Site, MOA may ask you to provide Personal Information and other information.  In order to engage in such activities, you will be required to provide information that allows MOA know the specifics of who you are or where you are, and may include, without limitation, your name, email address, and whether you are a guest at the Location.  If you choose to share any Personal Information with MOA, you will see that the amount and type of Personal Information MOA requests depends on how you use a Site or an App.  It is optional for you to engage in these activities.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information MOA asks you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

**_Examples_** **.** Examples of the type of information MOA and Provider may collect and store include are: first and last name; age and birthday; gender; mailing and email addresses, including zip code; and telephone number(s); device profile created and modified dates, shared device ‎preferences, lists of social networks associated with a user, Facebook ID, Google Plus ID, ‎Twitter Profile URL, LinkedIn Plus ID, Cookies, native device and applications unique ‎identifiers (UIDs), custom identifiers, an application identifiers.‎  

  1. **Children's Online Privacy Protection**




We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to Personal Information we may collect from children under 13 years of age (“ **Children** ”) on Sites and Apps and in certain other instances. Some of the features on Sites and Apps are age-gated, which means that access and/or use by children is restricted or prohibited.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 in connection with those features.  Of course, MOA cannot prevent certain users, including children, from fraudulently representing their age in order to gain access to the Site or an App.

In the event MOA knowingly collects Personal Information from Children, MOA will take additional steps to protect Children’s privacy, including:

  * Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of Personal Information we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;
  * In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of Personal Information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their Children;
  * Limiting our collection of Personal Information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity; and
  * Giving parents access or the ability to request access to Personal Information we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that the Personal Information be changed or deleted



For additional information about our practices regarding  Personal Information from Children, please read our [Children's Online Privacy Policy](http://www.mallofamerica.com/footer/privacy/childrens-online-privacy-policy).

MOA may use your IP address to, among other things: (a) help diagnose problems with Sites or ‎Apps, administer and improve Sites or Apps, and measure the use of Sites or Apps; (b) identify the ‎type of web browsers used, the pages viewed, the web sites from which a visitor found Sites or ‎Apps, and the search terms and search engines used to find the Site or Apps; and (c) gather other ‎web analytics information relating to visitors’ uses and navigations of Sites or Apps.  This ‎information does not identify you personally. On occasion MOA may aggregate this data with data ‎from other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns and provide this Aggregate Information to ‎vendors, business partners, or other parties to demonstrate the amount of interest in Sites and Apps,  help MOA plan for technical infrastructure requirements, and for other reasons.‎

  1. **Use of Your Information by MOA**




MOA may use your information, including Personal Information, for particular activities, including, without limitation: verifying your identity; customer service, customer relationship management (CRM), marketing and research; providing promotional and other information to you (such as through email marketing) on behalf of MOA, Affiliates of MOA and MOA business partners; responding to your requests; sending you text messages, push notifications, and other notifications through the ‎App and/or your mobile device; ‎contacting you regarding administrative notices; providing you with products and services that you request; communicating with you about your account; detecting, investigating and preventing activities that may violate our policies or be illegal.  MOA may share your information with its Affiliates or business partners in connection with any of the foregoing activities.  In addition, MOA’s Affiliates may have access to your information to perform services on behalf of MOA or for use on their own behalf, such as in connection with the aforementioned activities.  The privacy policies of MOA’s Affiliates and business partners will govern how they use your Personal Information. While we try to be selective in working with third parties, we are not responsible for their use of your Personal Information.

If payments are involved, we must release your credit card information to credit card ‎authorization service providers and associated banks to process your payment for purchases, returns ‎or refunds.‎

From time to time, MOA may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or surveys on our Sites or Apps. ‎If you participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these ‎surveys, sweepstakes or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this ‎information. The requested information may include name, address, date of birth and email address.  We may share in this information with our service provider or co-sponsors for the contest, sweepstakes, or survey.

  1. **Other Sites**




A Site or App may contain links to other websites. Additionally, other web sites may contain links to a Site.
