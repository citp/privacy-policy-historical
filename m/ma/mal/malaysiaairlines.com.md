## 

**What are our legal bases for processing your Personal Data?**

There are a number of different ways that we are lawfully able to process your Personal Data. We have set these out below.

_**Where using your Personal Data is necessary for us to carry out our obligations under our contract with you**_

We are allowed to use your Personal Data when it is necessary to do so for the performance of our contract with you.

For example, we need to collect your contact details in order to be able to book your flight or provide you with any additional services you have requested.

_**Where processing is necessary for us to carry out our legal obligations**_

As well as our obligations to you under any contract, we also have other legal obligations that we need to comply with and we are allowed to use your Personal Data when we need to in order to comply with those other legal obligations.

For example, we are required to transfer certain Personal Data to government authorities for anti-terrorism purposes.

_**Where using your data is in our legitimate interests**_

We are allowed to use your Personal Data where it is in our interests to do so, and those interests aren't outweighed by any potential prejudice to you.

We believe that our use of your Personal Data is within a number of our legitimate interests, including but not limited to:

  * To enable us to provide our services to our customers;
  * To help us satisfy our legal obligations (for example, in relation to anti-terrorism);
  * To help us understand our customers better and provide better, more relevant services to them; and
  * To help us keep our systems and physical premises secure and prevent unauthorized access or cyber attacks.



We don't think that any of the activities set out in this Privacy Policy will prejudice you in any way. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your Personal Data on this basis. We have set out details regarding how you can go about doing this above.

**_Where you give us your consent to use your Personal Data_**

We are allowed to use your data where you have specifically consented. In order for your consent to be valid:

  * It has to be given freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;
  * You have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;
  * You should only be asked to consent to one thing at a time – we therefore avoid "bundling" consents together so that you don't know exactly what you're agreeing to; and
  * You need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – we're likely to provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.



As part of our relationship with you, we may ask you for specific consents to allow us to use your data in certain ways. For example, we currently ask for your consent to provide you with marketing communications. If we require your consent, we will provide you with sufficient information so that you can decide whether or not you wish to consent.

You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. We have set out details regarding how you can go about this above.

## 

**Your rights**

You have various rights in relation to the Personal Data which we hold about you. We have described these below.

To get in touch with us about any of these rights, please contact us at:

Business Integrity Department,

Malaysia Airlines Berhad, 1st Floor, Administration Building,

South Support Zone, KLIA, 64000 Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia.

[privacy@malaysiaairlines.com](mailto:privacy@malaysiaairlines.com)

We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled). Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.

**_Right to object_**

This right enables you to object to us processing your Personal Data where we do so for one of the following reasons:

  * because it is in our legitimate interests to do so (for further information please see below);
  * to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority;
  * to send you direct marketing materials; or
  * for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.



**_Right to withdraw consent_**

Where we have obtained your consent to process your Personal Data for certain activities (for example, for marketing), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to use your data for that purpose unless we consider that there is an alternative legal basis to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose, in which case we will inform you of this condition.

In particular, you may elect to stop receiving promotional activities by:

(a) unsubscribing from the mailing list;

(b) editing the relevant account settings to unsubscribe; or

(c) sending a request to [customer@malaysiaairlines.com](mailto:customercare@malaysiaairlines.com)

**_Data Subject Access Requests_**

You may ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or delete such information. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless permitted by law. If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.

**_Right to erasure_**

You have the right to request that we "erase" your Personal Data in certain circumstances. Normally, this right exists where:

  * The data are no longer necessary;
  * You have withdrawn your consent to us using your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue;
  * The data has been processed unlawfully;
  * It is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our obligations under law; or
  * You object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.



We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for erasure in limited circumstances and we will always tell you our reason for doing so.

When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data.

**_Right to restrict processing_**

You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances, for example if you dispute the accuracy of the Personal Data that we hold about you or you object to our processing of your Personal Data for our legitimate interests. If we have shared your Personal Data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your Personal Data.

**_Right to rectification_**

You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data that we hold about you. If we have shared this Personal Data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You may also request details of the third parties that we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data to. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.

In particular, you may update or make amendments to your Personal Data as below:

(a) for online registered customers, you may login to your online account and update your Personal Data; or

(b) for every other customer, you may email your request to [privacy@malaysiaairlines.com](mailto:privacy@malaysiaairlines.com)

**_Right of data portability_**

If you wish, you have the right to transfer your Personal Data between service providers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer the details we hold on you to another third party. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format so that you can transfer the data. Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you.

**_Right to complain_**

You have the right to lodge a complaint with our regulator, who is the Commissioner of Personal Data Protection in Malaysia.

We shall take practical steps to ensure that their employees, officers, agents, consultants, contractors and such other third parties mentioned above who are involved in the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data will observe and adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 

**Where do we store your Personal Data?**

We will store your Personal Data in the country in which we are based (i.e. Malaysia). As discussed above, we may also disclose your Personal Data to our group companies and their service providers located in Malaysia and elsewhere, and to employees operating outside of the EEA who work for us or for one of our group companies or their respective service providers.

We want to make sure that your Personal Data is stored and transferred in a way which is secure.

We will therefore only transfer data outside of the EEA where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data. For example, this could be:

  * By way of an intra-group agreement between MAB entities, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of  Personal Data by controllers in the EEA to controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws;
  * By way of a data transfer agreement with a third party, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of Personal Data by controllers in the EEA to controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws; or
  * By transferring your data to an entity which has signed up to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for the transfer of Personal Data from entities in the EU to entities in the United States of America or any equivalent agreement in respect of other jurisdictions; or
  * By transferring your data to a country where there has been a finding of adequacy by the European Commission in respect of that country's levels of data protection via its legislation; or
  * Where it is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between ourselves and a third party and the transfer is in your interests for the purposes of that contract; or
  * Where you have explicitly consented to the data transfer.



Where we transfer your Personal Data outside the EEA and where the country or territory in question does not maintain adequate data protection standards, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 

**How do we keep your Personal Data secure?**

We will take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect your Personal Data from misuse, interference and loss; and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. In addition, the Company will secure your data in following ways:

(a) register all those who are allowed access;

(b) control and limit access based on necessity;

(c) maintain proper record of access and transfer of Personal Data;

(d) ensure all employees of the Company protect confidentiality;

(e) conduct awareness programmes to all employees on responsibility to protect Personal Data;

(f) establish physical security procedures;

(g) bind third parties involved in processing of Personal Data; and

(h) do not use removable device and cloud computing service to transfer or store Personal Data unless with written consent from top management of the Company.

##

We shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all Personal Data is destroyed or permanently deleted when no longer required and prepare disposal schedule for inactive data with 24 month period.

## 

**Links to third party website**

We may link this website and/or our applications to other companies or organizations websites (collectively, “ **Third Party Sites** ”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to such Third Party Sites as those sites are outside our control. If you access Third Party Sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect your personal information. Please ensure that you are satisfied with the privacy statements of these Third Party Sites before you submit any personal information. We try, as far as we can, to ensure that all third party linked sites have equivalent measures for protection of your personal information, but we cannot be held responsible legally or otherwise for the activities, privacy policies or levels of privacy compliance of these Third Party Sites.
