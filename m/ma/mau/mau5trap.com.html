<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your California Privacy Rights. California residents may opt out of having their personally identifiable information shared with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes by contacting us as described in the “Contact” section. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates. There is no industry standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. mau5trap currently does not take action in response to these signals.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">How to Control Identifier Settings. You can control how these identifiers are used, including the ability to reset them, through your device settings. Below you can learn about how to control cookie settings on popular web browsers:</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">mau5trap may work with third-party advertisers that use cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant advertising about mau5trap Products and Services on our websites and across the internet. To provide this ‘interest-based advertising’, the parties combine non-personal data about your online activities acquired over time, which help cater advertising that we deliver to you. Examples of this may include a mau5trap advertisement on a Facebook page, or a Google-owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within Google’s advertising network. We do not share your personal information as part of this process. Where necessary we obtain your consent to this process. At all times, you can opt out of these personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI websites and DAA websites. Opting out may make the ads you see across the internet less relevant to you.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you have opted out of receiving communications from us, we will not use your email for interest-based advertising. If you have any questions about the use of your personal information, please send an email to privacy@mau5trap.com.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">mau5trap may modify or update this Policy when necessary to reflect customer feedback and changes in our mau5trap Products and Service. Please review it regularly. When we update this Policy, we will revise the ‘Last Update’ date at the top of the Policy. If there are material changes to the Policy or in how mau5trap uses your personal data, we will notify you either by posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to regularly review this Policy to learn more how mau5trap is using and protecting your information.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, tags, web beacons, and other identifiers to help us personalize our websites for you, remember your preferences, understand how users are using our websites or app, and help customize our marketing offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. This helps us to provide you with a smooth browsing experience and allows us to improve our Site and provide you with tailored content and advertising.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may impact your overall user experience. Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal whereby you may indicate your preference regarding tracking and cross-site tracking. Although we do not currently employ technology that recognizes DNT signals, we will only process your personal data in accordance with this Policy. For more information on managing cookies, please go to www.allaboutcookies.org, or visit www.youronlinechoices.eu which has further information about behavioural advertising and online privacy.

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Type of Cookie Purpose of Cookie Strictly Necessary These cookies are essential in order to enable you to browse our Site and use its features. The information collected by these cookies relate to the operation of our Site, for example website scripting language and security tokens to maintain secure areas of our Site, including shopping baskets.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Type of Cookie Purpose of Cookie Performance / Analytics These cookies collect anonymous information about how you use our Site, like most visited pages, whether you receive any error messages, and how you arrived at our Site. Information collected by these cookies is used for optimization and never identifies you. These cookies are sometimes placed by third-party providers of web traffic analysis services, such as Google Analytics.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Functional These cookies remember choices you make, for example the country you visit our Site from and your language to improve your experience of our Site. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and cannot be used to track your browsing activity on other websites. Targeting or Advertising These cookies collect information about your browsing habits and inferred interests in order to make advertising more relevant to you. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advert, as well as to measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. These cookies are usually placed by third-party advertising networks. They remember the other websites that you visit and this information is shared with third-party organisations, for example advertisers. Social Media These cookies allow you to share what you’ve been doing on our Site with social media organisations such as Facebook and Twitter. These cookies are not within our control. Please refer to the privacy policies of these organisations for how their cookies work.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Please note that third parties may use cookies over which we have no control.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We may use cookies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">to collect anonymized data on users behaviour on the site. We may also capture what site a user has come from and what site they go to and also some demographic data (e.g. the user’s location) and we may use that data to analyse user behavior across multiple sites;</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">to categorize pools of users (on an anonymised basis) based on demographic and/or behavioural data and use this to target our advertising.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Web Beacons. We, or our third-party partners, may employ a software technology called web beacons (also known as web bugs, clear gifs or pixels) which helps us understand what content is effective, for example by counting the number of users who have visited these pages, and to understand usage patterns. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and e-mail. We, or our third-party partners, may tie the information gathered by web beacons to the other information we collect about you.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative, Digital Advertising Alliance, or European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">USERS OF SITES IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This section of this Policy applies only if you use the Site from a country that is a Member State of the European Economic Area, and supplements the information in this Policy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Legal Basis for Data Processing. We process personal data for the purposes set out in this Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process personal data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us (for example, to provide you with the services you request and to identify and authenticate you so you may use the Site); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the Site); and based on consent by our customers (for example, to communicate with you about our products and services and</span> <span class="s1">provide you with marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by using preference settings in emails or on our Sites, using this form, or emailing us as set out in the Contact section) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We may use automated decision-making technologies, including profiling, to support our data processing activities. Our automated decision-making capabilities include logic that attempts to identify artists, music, communications, products, or offers that we believe may interest you. By using this logic, it helps us personalize your interactions with mau5trap and mau5trap artists. For you, this means that you may see online advertisements, direct marketing communications (if you have subscribed), or other advertising or marketing messages or special offers based on your activity on our Sites or interactions with mau5trap or our third-party partners.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal data for processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you to use all the features of the Site.</span></p>
