# Privacy Policy

Like most website operators, Mautic.org, Mautic.net and Mautic.com hereafter collectively referred to as Mautic, collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Mautic’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Mautic’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Mautic may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Mautic also collects potentially personally-identifying information (PII) like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Mautic does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Mautic’s websites choose to interact with Mautic in ways that require Mautic to gather personally-identifying information (PII). The amount and type of information that Mautic gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, Mautic collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Mautic. Mautic does not disclose PII other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply PII, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Mautic may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Mautic may reveal how many downloads a particular version got, or say which plugins are most popular based on checks from api.Mautic.org, a web service used by Mautic installations to check for new versions of Mautic and plugins. However, Mautic does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Mautic discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information (PII) only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Mautic’s behalf or to provide services available at Mautic’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Mautic’s websites, including Mautic.org and Mautic.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Mautic will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and PII to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Mautic discloses potentially personally-identifying and PII only when required to do so by law, or when Mautic believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mautic, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Mautic website and have supplied your email address, Mautic may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Mautic and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Mautic takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information (PII).

### Automatic Collection, Cookies & Web Beacons

Mautic or our service providers or our third party advertisers or links to third party websites and social media widgets may use automatic collection technologies including cookies and web beacons that collect information about you or your visits for purposes to improve your web activities or to deliver targeted content to you. Mautic does not provide personally-identifying information to these third parties and is not responsible or liable for nor do we endorse or control their activities. Use of third party links, advertisers, sites and/or widgets will be subject to the respective third party’s privacy policies and terms of service.

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Mautic uses cookies to help Mautic identify and track visitors, their usage of Mautic website, and their website access preferences. Mautic visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Mautic’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Mautic’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Pages of this Website and any e-mails sent to you may contain web beacons. Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic files that are embedded onto a web page or an email to document traffic and for website analytics without collecting any Personal Information, that, for example, allow us to count users who have visited webpages or opened our e-mails.
