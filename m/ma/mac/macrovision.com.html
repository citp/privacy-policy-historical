	      <h1>Macrovision Legal and Privacy Notices</h1>
	      <p>Macrovision respects your privacy
	            and is committed to protect the personal information that you
	            share with
                        us. Generally, you can browse through our website without
giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information
to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your
personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal
information.</p>
	      <p><b>Information Collection<br>
                  </b> Personal information means any information that may be
                  used to identify an individual, including, but not limited
                  to, a first and last name, email address,
      a company or home, postal or other physical address, other contact information,
      title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal or product interests,
      other information when needed to provide a service you requested.</p>
	      <p>When you
                  browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have
                  previously indicated that you wish Macrovision to remember
                  your login and password.
      We don't collect personal information, including your email address. We
      do log your IP
      address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which
      part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not
      link your
      IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our
      website. Like many other commercial websites, the Macrovision website may
      use a standard
      technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how
      you use the site. Please go to "Cookies and Tracking Information" below
      for more information.</p>
	      <p>Macrovision collects personal information when you
            register with Macrovision for a Macrovision account, when you use
	            certain Macrovision products or
            services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in
	            an online survey, when
            you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, other product
            promotions, or when you submit your information to Macrovision for
	            any other reason. From
            time to time, Macrovision receives personal information from business
	            partners and vendors. Macrovision only uses such information
	            if it has been collected
            in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this
            Policy and applicable laws.</p>
	      <p>Access to certain Macrovision web
	            pages requires a login and a password. The use of those web
	            pages, and the information or programs downloadable
            from those
            sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer
            and Macrovision. Your personal information may be retained by Macrovision
            to
            verify compliance
            with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software
            downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications
            available on those
            pages.</p>
	      <p><b>Notice<br>
                  </b> When personal information is collected, we will inform
                  you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection.
                  Macrovision
                  does not
                  intend to
                  transfer your personal information to third parties without
                  your consent, except under the limited conditions described
                  under the
                  discussion entitled "Information
                  Sharing and Disclosure" below.</p>
	      <p>If you choose to provide
                  us with your personal information, we may transfer that information,
                  within Macrovision or to
                  Macrovision's
                  third party service
                  providers,
                  including across borders and from your country or jurisdiction
                  to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>
	      <p>We will
	            always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of
                  receiving direct marketing or market research information.
                  This means we assume you have given
                  us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance
                  with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate
                  that you do not consent, for instance
                  by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the
                  point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will
                  provide you with the opportunity to "opt
                  in." This means we will require your affirmative action
                  to indicate your consent before we use your information for
                  purposes other than the purpose for
                  which it was submitted.</p>
	      <p><b>Cookies and Tracking Technology<br>
                  </b> A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write
                  to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain
                  information
                  such
                  as a user
                  ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but
                  the only personal information a cookie can contain is information
                  you
                  supply yourself. A
                  cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files
                  created by other sites.
                  Some parts of Macrovision's website may use cookies to track
                  user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the
                  usefulness
                  of our website
                  information to
                  our users and to see how effective our navigational structure
                  is in helping users reach that information.</p>
	      <p>If you prefer not
                  to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set
                  your browser to warn you before accepting cookies
                  and refuse the cookie
                  when
                  your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse
                  all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you
                  may not
                  be able to take
                  full advantage
                  of Macrovision's website if you do so. You do not need to have
                  cookies turned on to use/navigate through many parts of our
                  website, except
                  access to certain
                  of Macrovision's web pages require a login and password.</p>
	      <p><b>How We Use Information Collected<br>
                  </b> Macrovision uses information for several general purposes:
                  to fulfill your requests for certain products and services,
                  to personalize
                  your experience
                  on
                  our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements,
                  software updates, special offers or other information we think
                  you'd like to hear about
                  either from us or from our business partners, and to better
                  understand your needs and provide you with better services.
                  We may also use
                  your information to send
                  you, or to have our business partners send you, direct marketing
                  information or contact you for market research.</p>
	      <p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure<br>
                  </b> Because Macrovision is a global company, your personal
                  information may be shared with other Macrovision offices or
                  subsidiaries around
                  the world. All such
                  entities are governed by this Privacy Policy and/or are bound
                  by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements.</p>
	      <p>Your
                  personal information is never shared outside Macrovision without
                  your permission, except under conditions explained
                  below. Inside
                  Macrovision,
                  data is stored in
                  controlled servers with limited access. Your information may
                  be stored and processed in the United States or any other country
                  where Macrovision,
                  its subsidiaries,
                  affiliates or agents are located.</p>
	      <p>Macrovision may send your
	            personal information to other companies or people under any
	            of the following circumstances: when we
                  have your consent to
                  share the information;
                  we need to share your information to provide the product or
                  service you have requested; we need to send the information
                  to companies
                  who work on
                  behalf of
                  Macrovision to provide a product or service to you (we will
                  only provide those companies the information they need to deliver
                  the
                  service, and they
                  are prohibited
                  from using that information for any other purpose); or we want
                  to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements,
                  software
                  updates, special
                  offers
                  or other information we think you'd like to hear about either
                  from us or from our business partners. We will also disclose
                  your personal
                  information
                  if required
                  to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or in urgent
                  circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our
                  websites.</p>
	      <p><b>Data Security<br>
                  </b> Your Macrovision account information is password-protected
                  for your privacy and security. Macrovision safeguards the security
                  of
                  the data you
                  send us with
                  physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain
                  areas of our websites, Macrovision uses industry-standard SSL-encryption
                  to enhance
                  the security of
                  data transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal
                  information,
                  we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit
                  to us, and so we urge
                  you to take every precaution to protect your personal data
                  when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often,
                  use a combination
                  of letters
                  and numbers,
                  and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>
	      <p><b>Third Party Websites<br>
                  </b> Macrovision's website contains links to other sites. Macrovision
                  does not share your personal information with those websites

                  for
                  their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the
                  privacy policies of those companies.</p>
	      <p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy<br>
                  </b> Macrovision will amend this policy from time to
                        time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we
                        use your personal
                        information
