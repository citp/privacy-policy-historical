### Privacy Statement (Personal Information)

**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE:** Our primary goals in collecting and using information are to provide and improve the service, to administer and assist you in administering your Account on the service, and to provide you with a better experience with the service. We store and process information in the United States. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we transfer your information to the United States and processes it there, which is required for the normal operation of the service. 

  * **Personal information** is information that specifically identifies an individual, including, but not limited to, an individual's name, email, credit card or other billing information and billing address (for the purposes of fulfilling a purchase order and licensing). Personal information does not include information that has been irreversibly anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer enable us, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify you.
  * **Non-personal information** is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as an individual's IP, zip/postal code, but that may be considered part of an individual's personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual. 



**What Personal Information We Collect**  
Depending on the services you use, we collect different kinds of personal information from or about you. In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our services. This unique user ID is stored in connection with your information. 

  * **Information you provide** \- We collect information in any form you willingly enter data into. Such as your name and email during account registration.
