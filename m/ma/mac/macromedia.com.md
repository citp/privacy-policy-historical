# Macromedia and Your Privacy

Questions or concerns regarding this statement should be directed to the [Macromedia privacy coordinator](mailto:privacy@macromedia.com). If your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe online at: [www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Macromedia to resolve your concerns. 

**Macromedia and your privacy**   
At Macromedia we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a visitor to macromedia.com, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of macromedia.com, download free software, request information, or subscribe to Macromedia newsletters. 

We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide on macromedia.com (and related Macromedia sites) are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.

When you provide Macromedia with your name (or alias), e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you "opt in," Macromedia and Macromedia representatives may use the provided information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, classes, new services, and other Macromedia related information. ("Representatives" include value-added resellers and authorized training partners.) Macromedia does not offer, or allow the selling of, any user-provided information to third parties.

Macromedia respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users.

If you do not want Macromedia or Macromedia representatives to contact you, you may "opt out" of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting Macromedia directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the option to opt back in and have Macromedia contact you based on your previous or new preferences. For instructions, please see the section "Contact Us," below.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most Macromedia Web sites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.

**Macromedia membership and the use of log files (cookies)**  
Macromedia offers free membership to all macromedia.com visitors. In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide both personal information and preferences. This information is stored and protected by your user-established Member ID and Password.

There is an additional "Remember me" option. By selecting it, you allow Macromedia to save your Member ID so you don't have to re-enter it each time you return to any Macromedia Web site. Macromedia remembers you by placing a log file (cookie) that contains only enough information to identify you upon return visits. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and helps Macromedia provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent.

No information, other than that found in the Membership cookie, will be accessed by any Macromedia system. Access to your membership information always requires both your Member ID and Password.

Macromedia also utilizes visitor log files (cookies) with our Web site. Once a user enters our site, a cookie follows them through their click stream path. Examples of information being collected by these cookies include the number of times a user came to our site(s), and the paths they took to get there.

Macromedia uses the data collected from Web site visitor cookies in aggregate form only and does not collect any personally identifiable information. Use of this information helps us better understand what users are seeking and learning at our Web site(s) and helps us identify potential navigation issues.  


**How Macromedia will protect your personal information**   
Macromedia will always protect the personal information that you share with us. Macromedia stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your credit card number only to secure your current payment. The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card number subsequent to the transaction at hand and will not use the number for marketing purposes.

If Macromedia requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous. Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities.

Macromedia may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that effect.

**DoubleClick Banner Advertisements  
**We use an outside ad company, DoubleClick, to serve ads on our Web site. In the process of serving ads, DoubleClick places a DoubleClick cookie in your browser's cookie file. By delivering ads on the macromedia.com site, DoubleClick is able to record which ads a browser has seen (identified by the unique DoubleClick cookie), and which macromedia.com Web site pages the browser was viewing when the ads were delivered. This Web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information DoubleClick has (e.g. what type of operating system your computer uses). The information is used as part of the ad serving process for reporting and to target the ads you see online. Unlike the cookies macromedia.com may use on our Web sites, cookies received with banner ads are collected by DoubleClick; we do not have access to this information.

We recognize that not all users wish to receive ads targeted to their interests and we put the wishes of our users first. We want you to have the choice. If you want to learn more about DoubleClick's ad serving privacy policies and the use of their cookies, visit the DoubleClick site at [www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/policies.asp](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/policies.asp).

If you would like to opt out of DoubleClick's cookie now, click here: [www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/opt-out.asp](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/opt-out.asp)

At macromedia.com the most important thing for us is that you make the choice that is best for you.
