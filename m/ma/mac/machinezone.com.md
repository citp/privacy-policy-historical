Some of the cookies the Service places on your computer are linked to your user ID number(s).

We will collect or receive information from the following other sources (i) other Service users who choose to upload their email contacts; (ii) third party information providers such as digital advertising companies; and (iii) social networking sites. 

To provide our games, websites and interest-based advertising, we use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. This section describes our use of these technologies and how you can manage your preferences.

Find out more

How do ad identifiers, cookies, and similar technologies work? 

Ad identifiers are non-permanent identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising (the ‘IDFA’), which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your desktop computer or mobile device. 

When you access the Service, we collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and Service; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, will use Log Files and other tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information over time and across different websites following your use of the Service, including cookies, WiFi information, IP addresses, geo-location, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, Service state and the date and time of activity on our Services, and other similar information. In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use. Our Service currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) settings in your web browser and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For further details regarding DNT, visit donottrack.us.

We also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your in-Service preferences and speed up load times.

How to adjust your preferences for interest-based advertising

You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.

You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit adobe.com and make changes at the privacy settings panel. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our Services, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your Service activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our Services or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.

We also use Google Analytics, who uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the Service and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data when you visit our Site or use our Services, visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>.

The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) allows for the central opting out of all its members’ cookies from a single opt-out page. If you prefer not to receive relevant advertising on web pages, please click on the following link: networkadvertising.org/choices/. If you delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.

In general, we collect, store and use your information to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, fun, and customized experience, and we use it as necessary to provide you with the Service pursuant to the Terms of Use, for our legitimate interest to understand how our users navigate our websites and apps and to improve our services, including the Service, or on the basis of your consent. In litigation or for other legal purposes involving us or a third party, we may also need to transfer your personal information to countries with a lower standard of data protection laws than is applicable in your country of residence.

We will use information collected from you in any one or more of the following ways:

  * To create your Service accounts and allow access to our Services;
  * To identify and suggest connections with other users;
  * To enable user-to-user communications;
  * To provide technical support and respond to user inquiries;
  * To prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Use;
  * To deliver and target advertising;
  * To notify users of in-Service updates;
  * To provide in-Service leader boards and promote in-Service player achievements;
  * To solicit input and feedback to improve MZ group company products and services and customize your user experience;
  * To inform users about new products or promotional offers;
  * To engage in commonly accepted practices, such as contacting you at the email address we have on file if you are a potential winner in a sweepstakes; and


  * To improve and develop our products and Services.



One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to us, we’ll use it to (i) respond to customer support inquiries, (ii) keep you informed of your in-Service activity, including comments from friends, notifications about in-Service status and requests, and (iii) provide you with details of our similar games or Services, unless you have asked us to stop sending you our marketing material or opted out from our electronic marketing communications. Some messages, such as invites for friends to join you in a Service, may include your name and profile photo. If you are not a current user, we will send promotional e-mail messages and promotional messages directly or in partnership with third parties only if you have provided your prior consent in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations for us to do so.

Marketing 

We may use the information we hold about you to promote our Services in any one of the following ways:

  * Advertising on third party websites, apps, and Internet-connected devices;
  * Showing you promotions for our other games or Services;
  * Sending you marketing materials by email.



Find out more

What information do we use for marketing?

We use information about you to try to make sure you only see marketing from us that might be of interest to you, including:

  * ad identifiers and other information collected from your device. For more information, see Ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies;
  * the games you play and information about how you interact with our Services;
  * your age, country or region, and gender; and
  * other information that we might acquire from our third party marketing partners or other third parties who have obtained your consent or have another legal basis to share that information with us.



Opting out of direct marketing from us

You can exercise choices over the direct marketing we send you in the following ways:

  * you can withhold your consent for us to send you direct marketing emails by opting out when we collect your email address or by electing not to share your email address with us when you first create an account using your Facebook details;
  * you can remove yourself from receiving email marketing from us at any time by simply clicking the unsubscribe link in any direct marketing email we send to you or sending an email to [support@mz.com](mailto:support@mz.com); and
  * to disable interest-based advertising, please see How to adjust your preferences for interest based advertising. 



You should note that if you opt out of receiving interest based or targeted advertising, you will still see advertising and you may see advertising for our Services, but that advertising will not be targeted using your personal information.

Third Parties’ Direct Marketing

We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by “opting in” to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.

Your access to the Services will not be affected if you do not “opt in” to receive information from such third parties. 

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to: Customer Service c/o Machine Zone, Inc., 2225 E. Bayshore Road, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94303.

We share your personal data with our Affiliates including in the United States. Please be aware that the US and other jurisdictions may have a lower standard of data protection laws than your own jurisdiction. We will also share your personal data with third party recipients (i.e., parties other than the MZ group of companies) including outside the European Economic Area, in the following circumstances:

## (a) Third party service providers

We provide your information to third party recipients. These categories of recipients include:

In the event that MZ undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer all of your information, including personal data, to the successor organization in such transition. In such case, we will first notify you in accordance with local law requirements, if any, regarding those items of personal data that will be transferred, the name and contact details of the recipient, and inform you of how you can withdraw consent thereto.

## (c) Safety, security and compliance with law

Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications (including without limitation chat text, voice communications and IP addresses) may be accessed and monitored as necessary to provide the Service and may be disclosed: (i) when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations; (iii) where we believe that the Service is being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; (iv) when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and (v) in order to protect our rights or property.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit any personal data from children and we do not knowingly allow children to register for or use the Services. Children should not use our Services or send us any personal data about themselves at any time.

If you believe that we might have information from or about a child, please contact us.

## (a) Information we receive from a social networking site (“SNS”)

To manage the information MZ receives about you from an SNS where you use our Services, you will need to follow the instructions at that site for updating your information and changing your privacy settings.

Once MZ receives your information from an SNS, that information is stored and used by MZ in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you may access and update that information as described below. Service or other accounts created with MZ are considered active until we receive a user request to delete them or deactivate them.

## (b) Other methods of accessing or controlling your information 

If you no longer want MZ to make active use of your information, you may send an e-mail to [support@mz.com](mailto:support@mz.com).

## (c) European Countries Users’ Rights

If you are located in a country in the European Union, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland, you have certain rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you, which we detail below, and which are subject to exemptions under applicable data privacy laws.

Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure.

We also may not provide you with certain data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property) as permitted under applicable data protection rights. 

### (iii) Correction 

You have the right to correct any personal data held about you that is inaccurate. Where you request correction, please explain in detail why you believe the personal data we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required.

Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal data, we may use it again if there are valid grounds for us to do so (e.g. for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). 

### (v) Objection 

You have the right to object to our processing of data about you other than where required to perform under the Terms of Use, e.g. in order to send you promotions and special offers marketing.
