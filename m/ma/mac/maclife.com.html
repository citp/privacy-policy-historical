<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Future US, Inc., a magazine, disc media and website publisher, we are interested in protecting your privacy. But sometimes we do need information to understand how to make our properties more interesting, more specialized and more successful, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete privacy statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Non-US Visitors</strong><br>Our privacy policy is intended to meet the laws and requirements of the United States. If you are visiting from outside the United States any information you provide will be treated in accordance with the laws of the United States or, if the law in jurisdiction does not permit you to access our website, then you must not maintain access to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Collecting Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (that is, your first and last name; your home or business address; your e-mail address; your telephone number; your gender) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, or if you subscribe to one of our magazines or properties, or elect to participate in a forum and/or a survey. Personal information collected by any of our websites often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example: If you choose to subscribe to a magazine or e-mail newsletter, we may request personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, and shipping information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use of your Personal Information</strong><br>We may use your personal information for the following primary purposes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.    To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you. </p>
<p>2.    To alert you to special offers, updated information and other services. </p>
<p>3.    To help us determine if any modifications need to be made to our publications or with respect to our subscriptions. </p>
<p>4.    To contact you regarding participation in a reader survey. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also will occasionally share this information with third parties so that you may be informed of matters, services or products of interest to readers of our magazines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of any of our websites, or the public; and (d) comply with negotiated agreements in the event of a merger or sale of any of our products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Control of your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>When you register on one of our websites, or otherwise give us personal information, we will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will occasionally allow other companies to offer our customers information about their products and services. If you do not wish to receive any such mailings, you may send an e-mail to webmaster@futureus.com. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security of your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Future US, Inc., will use its best efforts to protect the security of your personal information and honor your choices for its intended use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Email Correspondence</strong><br>We may respond to email sent directly to us or through a online submission form. This information and emails would only be shared with a third party in connection with a court order, sale of the website(s) to a third party or to defend a legal claim. These emails would only rarely be used for one time correspondence with that user. These e-mails are kept internally for our own day to day business purposes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Special Notification with respect to Children’s Privacy (Users under the age of 13)</strong> <br>In response to concerns about protecting children’s privacy online, Congress enacted the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with our policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.    Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; </p>
<p>2.    Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties;</p>
<p>3.    Give children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information;</p>
<p>4.    Entice children with the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parental Rights</strong></p>
<p>Except upon our receipt from a parent or guardian, we DO NOT collect information from children under 13. We are required by COPPA to post parental rights concerning removal of this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A parent or guardian may confirm, correct or have deleted the child’s personal information; discontinue further use of the child’s information and/or communication with the child; and/or revoke his or her earlier consent to collect and use the child’s information. To do so, please contact us at webmaster@futureus.com and we will review or update your child’s information as appropriate. Please be sure to include in your email message the information you want changed or deleted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Message Receipt &amp; COPPA</strong></p>
<p>Our receipt of messages is set up to only accept registrations from ages 13 and up. Any users under 13 who try to register are screened via a online age check that uses cookies. Users under 13 who wish to register must submit a signed parental consent form to do so. The parent will then decide what information to release on the parental form which may include address, phone number &amp; email address. We maintain this information on file for COPPA compliance and do not share this information with third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With proper identification parents can remove their under 13 child from participation in our message board (See Parental Rights above). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, we may elect to collect aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. We do not track individual’s use of the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong> <br>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit certain of our websites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future US does not provide any personal information to a advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. Downloads or other content interacted with from third party advertisers is subject to the advertiser’s privacy policies, not this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future US lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Future US’s cookies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Cookies &amp; IP Addresses</strong></p>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party ad server may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some areas will not function properly if you do so. There are many sources for additional information about Internet cookies, and we encourage anyone concerned about the use of cookies to do more research on the topic so you can make an informed decision about accepting them from any site. As technology advances and cookies provide more functionality, we expect to utilize them in different ways. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IP Address</strong></p>
<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information. The IP address is not tied to any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding this statement, you should contact webmaster@futureus.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Statement</strong></p>
<p>We will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this Statement, we will notify you by placing prominent notice on the Web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>
<p>We welcome your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy, please contact us by e-mail, or postal mail at</p>
