The IDG Publishing Network is operated by our ultimate holding company International Data Group, Inc. together with its subsidiaries ("our Group").</p>

<p><strong>The Purpose of this Policy - Your Consent</strong></p>

<p>Respecting the privacy of our customers and ensuring the confidentiality of customer information is critical to IDG UK. The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") is to ensure that we interact with all of our customers in line with current legislation (such as the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003) and in accordance with their wishes.  This Policy sets out below what types of personal data may be collected about you, how we may process and use it, and who we may share it with.

</p><p style="text-decoration:underline;">By using this Website and/ or submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing activities described in this Policy. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Details</strong></p>

<p>IDG UK and its suppliers may collect, process and use your personal data (including your name, postal address, email address, telephone, mobile and fax numbers). We will do so to contact you regarding the services you have requested and/or to offer services to you, and/or to provide the services you have requested. This includes re-registration/renewal notifications, payment processing, surveys on improving our service to you and/or invitations to exhibitions, seminars and shows. IDG UK may employ trusted third party specialists to process your data on our behalf in order to deliver the products and services to you in a more efficient manner. </p>

<p>This personal data is stored on IDG UK computers in the UK, and, because IDG UK is part of the IDG Publishing Network, may be transferred to, stored and processed, inside the UK and/or outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") by other members of our Group. In addition, if you consent to receive offerings from third party organisations, this personal data remains with IDG UK who will send the third party offerings.  Except as set forth below with regard to the provision of free resources, at no time will your personal data be transferred to such third party organisations.  Finally, as stated above, your personal data may be transferred to and stored by third party specialists engaged by IDG to assist in the provision of the content and services you request. Such vendors may be located inside or outside of the EEA. In all cases, we will only transfer your data outside the EEA to those countries that ensure at least adequate levels of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.  </p>

<p>From time to time IDG UK and/or the IDG Publishing Network may invite you to register in order to receive such offerings as magazines, email newsletters, enter competitions, and receive goods or services from IDG UK and/or the IDG Publishing Network websites. This may require you to confirm personal data such as your name, email address, and mailing address postcodes. This information is mandatory and is required by IDG UK for security purposes, and enables IDG UK to supply a reasonable level of services to users and our advertisers.  We may also ask for information such as job function, job title, industry sector, company/ name and country. During registration, you will also be asked to choose a user name and password for future access to the relevant Website(s). </p>

<p>In order to provide you with free resources such as white papers and expert analysis, we may share your personal data and/or business information with third party organisations we partner with and whose content and/or other offerings you choose to view via an email offer we may send to you via Connect.com and/or connect.co.uk, and/or download from the Macworld Website or other IDG Publishing Network sites.</p>

<p>Because IDG UK is part of the IDG Publishing Network, you may receive offers that IDG UK believes will be of interest to you from any of the IDG Publishing Network sites.  However, IDG UK offers you the chance to opt out of receiving additional information from the IDG Publishing Network and our Group. You have the absolute right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. Whilst we give details in this Policy in relation to opting out, we want to make clear that you can at any time exercise this right by contacting us by post or email at the address set out at the foot of this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Opting in/ Opting out</strong></p>

<p>IDG offers you the opportunity to opt in to receive marketing information from carefully selected third party organisations. IDG UK will ensure that the contact you receive will be from reputable organisations. You may opt out at any time from receiving further such information by notifying us by post. IDG UK offers you the opportunity to opt out of receiving information from IDG UK about other products/services that IDG UK and our Group offer.  </p>

<p>IDG cannot accept any responsibility for use by third parties of data that you have consented to being passed on. </p>

<p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>

<p>If the business of operating this Website is sold, the relevant customer lists and other personal data of our subscribers and users will be transferred to the new owner. This will be done in accordance with current legislation.</p>

<p>We may disclose your personal data if we are under a duty to disclose your personal data as a result of a court order or any other legal obligation, any subpoena or legal process or as otherwise required by law, or if we believe it necessary to prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or violations of our policies.</p>

<p><strong>Changing your details and unsubscribing</strong></p>

<p>At all times as a recipient of an IDG UK product and/or service or an IDG Publishing Network product and/or service you will have the opportunity to amend your contact details and/or to modify your opt-in/opt-out choices. We will not actually delete your record from the applicable database(s) as we would no longer be able to identify you, which could lead to you receiving information from us in the future. To action any of these requests please contact the relevant customer care department of the product/service you subscribe to. </p>

<p>If you submit your email address to sign up for any of our online offerings including our newsletter(s) on the website, then you can unsubscribe at any time by either contacting, as applicable, IDG UK and/or the IDG Publishing Network directly or via the unsubscribe facility included in communications sent to you. </p>

<p><strong>Access to Information</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to be told what personal data we hold about you on our databases. You should write to Ms Alex Lincoln, IDG Communications Ltd, 101 Euston Rd, London, NW1 2RA, United Kingdom. In your letter please state your full name, your address and all publications and/or services from IDG UK to which you know you subscribe. A small administration charge of £5.00 will be made for fulfilling this request.  </p>

<p><strong>Anonymous information about your use of the Website</strong></p>

<p>In order that we can monitor and improve the Website, we may gather certain information about you when you use it, including details of your domain name and IP address, operating system, browser, version, cookie details (see below) and the website that you visited prior to our Website. IDG UK may make anonymous use of this information to help diagnose faults, manage our systems and gather broad demographic information about our users in general. This information will be stripped of all details that could identify you personally.   </p>

<p><strong>Other Links</strong></p>

<p>Please be aware that our Website may link to other web sites which may be accessed through our Website. This statement does not extend to sites that are linked to IDG UK sites.

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>We may use cookies to provide you with a convenient means of access, without needing your password. Also to protect the integrity of registered user names and passwords and to limit access to 'paid for' services. We will not disclose personal data obtained by the use of cookies to third parties. </p>

<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, though you do not have to. The 'help' portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. </p>

<p>When you request a page from the Website's web server, the server automatically collects some information about your system, including your IP address. IDG UK collects the minimum information necessary to make the service work efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Advertisement Servers</strong></p>

You are able to opt out of the ADTECH ad-serving cookie via the ADTECH privacy policy which can be viewed <a href="http://www.adtech.com/cookie_opt-out/">here</a>. </p>

<p>Furthermore, some advertisers may use third-party companies to track advertisements on our Website. Except as described above, we will not pass any personal data to them. Unless you visit the website of these companies and provide them with this information, those advertisers will not be able to identify who you are. This use of tracking technology by our advertisers is subject to their own privacy policies. IDG UK does not have control over the collection of information for advertising purposes. </p>
