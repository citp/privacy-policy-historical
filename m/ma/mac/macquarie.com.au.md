# Privacy policy - Macquarie Bank Limited

Central to the success of Macquarie is our commitment to our clients. We honour without reservation our obligation to respect and protect the privacy of the personal information of individuals with whom we deal.

###### The information we collect

Whenever it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we only collect information about you directly from you.  
We only collect personal information about you which is reasonably necessary to:

  * provide you quality products or services
  * consider applications and approaches you make to us
  * maintain your contact details.



We generally hold personal information relating to:

  * the products and services we provide or have provided to you
  * your financial interests and sometimes your financial position
  * your contact details.



We do not generally collect sensitive information about you unless required by applicable laws or rules. Sensitive information includes information relating to:

  * race
  * political or religious beliefs
  * sexual preferences
  * criminal convictions
  * membership of professional or trade associations or unions
  * health information.



  
We collect health information where we offer products with an insurance component to our customers. We do not use or share that information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of a customer's policy, claim or account, or as otherwise disclosed to the customer when the information was collected.

###### How that information is used

We only use and disclose personal information about you for the purpose for which it was disclosed to us or related purposes which would reasonably be expected without your permission.

For example, we may from time to time use your personal information to inform you of investment opportunities or to provide information about products and services which we expect may be of interest to you. However, we do respect your right to ask us not to do this.

We do not sell personal information to other organisations to allow them to do this.

We may disclose personal information to service providers who provide services in connection with our products and services or we may provide information about you to your nominated financial adviser [with your permission].

###### Keeping information accurate and up to date

We take all reasonable steps to ensure that all information we hold is as accurate as is possible. You are able to contact us at any time and ask for its correction if you feel the information we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete.

###### Keeping information secure

We use security procedures and the latest technology to protect the information we hold. Access to and use of personal information within Macquarie is appropriately limited to prevent misuse or unlawful disclosure of the information.

If other organisations provide support services, we require them to appropriately safeguard the privacy of the information provided to them.  
Where the personal information we collect is no longer required, we delete the information or permanently de-identify it.

###### How you can access your information

You can contact us to request access to your information. In normal circumstances we will give you full access to your information. However, there may be some legal or administrative reasons to deny access. If access is denied, we will provide you with the reason why.

###### Dealing with Macquarie online

If you visit Macquarie's website to browse, read or download information, our system will log these movements. These web site logs are not personally identifiable and Macquarie makes no attempt to link them with the individuals who browse the site.

If you visit Macquarie's website to log into our secure areas, such as Macquarie DirecTrade or transact@macquarie, we use cookies which will enable us to identify you. This is for security reasons only. Your account information is password protected and we recommend you do not divulge your password to anyone. To further protect your personal information, your log-in time will automatically expire after a certain period of inactivity.

###### Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that contains information about your visit to a web site. This information is provided by your computer during your first visit to a web server. The server records this information in a text file and stores this file on your hard drive. When you visit the same web site again, the server looks for the cookie and structures itself based on the information provided.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to warn you before accepting cookies. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. We use cookies to help us improve our service to visitors to our site and to ensure that our site stays easy to navigate and useful.

Macquarie cannot guarantee or accept responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of web sites to which we provide links.

###### RedSheriff

RedSheriff website measurement software is used to assist in tracking traffic patterns to and from Macquarie’s websites, anonymously surveying users of the sites. The RedSheriff system is used to collect such information as the number of unique visitors, how long these visitors spend on the website when they do visit, and common entry and exit points into and from the website.

This non-personal information is collected and aggregated by RedSheriff and provided to us to assist in our analysis of our websites. You cannot be identified personally from this information and no personal information is stored about you. RedSheriff systems comply with the Macquarie Privacy Policy. For further information about RedSheriff, go to the [Red Sheriff](http://www.redsheriff.com/au/home.htm) website.

Please note: RedSheriff website measurement uses cookies which are provided by a RedSheriff website: "imrworldwide.com".

###### DoubleClick Ad Management

Macquarie uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognise a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. DoubleClick systems comply with the Macquarie Privacy Policy. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [Double Click's privacy policy](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp).
