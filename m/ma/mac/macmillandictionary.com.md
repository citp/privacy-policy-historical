The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via: <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins>.

If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user's browser directly connects to Facebook's servers.

Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the user's Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something – the user's browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user's IP-address. Facebook states that it only collects anonymized IP-addresses in Germany.

The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as the user's rights in this respect and settings options for protecting the users privacy can be found under: <http://www.facebook.com/policy.php>.
