Why?                  consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how
                      we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                      understand what we do.

                      personal information; the reasons Mountain America Credit Union chooses to share; and whether
