## Privacy Policy

The nature of our services requires that we collect personal information from you. We take the responsibility of ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of that information very seriously.

This Privacy Policy sets forth our practices regarding the protection of your private information. Please read it carefully. By providing us with your information and visiting this web site, you will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Any capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to it in our Terms of Service.

**Scope of this privacy policy**

Macau 24 Hours Travel Agency Limited (“Macau.com”) is the operator of this site (“Operator”). This Privacy Policy applies only to this website and related Services provided directly by us. We do not exercise control over any other web sites unless specifically stated otherwise. When you follow a hyperlink to another web site, we strongly encourage you to read and understand the privacy practices and policies of that web site.

**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**

Online privacy concerns focus on the protection of “personally identifiable” information that an individual or other customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, “personally identifiable” information is information which can be associated with a specific person or entity, including but not limited to such information as a customer’s name, address, email address, telephone number, fax number, gender, age, national identification number, credit card information, bank account number, education level, occupation, household income, interests and favorite activities.

PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 

We may collect personally identifiable information from you when you purchase services from Macau.com or when you register for other Services. Macau.com may also collect personally identifiable information through surveys, newsletter registrations, contest registrations and other promotions.

We will not disclose this personal information except under the following circumstances:

  * You have specifically authorized us to disclose this information;
  * The recipient of this information is our subsidiary or parent company, or other affiliated legal entity with whom we are under common corporate control, which has agreed to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and disclosure of such personal information;
  * We have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce the applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Macau.com or the public as required or permitted by law. We may use your e-mail address for any purpose for which you provided it. We may also use it to respond to feedback given about our web site or services, to provide you with any information you request, to confirm receipt of e-mails you have sent to us or if we need to contact you for any reason. When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.



Please note that all of your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and the (countries) in which these computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your (country).

If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

OTHER INFORMATION

Apart from this personally identifiable information, we collect certain other information that does not personally identify you. Specific or aggregate information may be collected to help maintain accurate accounts, assist in marketing our products and services and to help make our web site more useful to you. Macau.com may provide aggregated statistical information about user behavior to reputable third parties. This is _not_ personally identifiable information.

**Collection of personal information by business partners**

We may form relationships with other organizations to bring you additional Services. Participation in these Services is voluntary. If you disclose personal information to a third party in connection with such Services, your information will be subject to the practices and policies of that third party. We will clearly indicate when a Service is provided by someone other than us. We also require each such third party to enter into a contract with us stating that such third party: (i) will use your personal information only in direct connection with the relevant Service and (ii) will not share your personal information with any other person or entity except as necessary to provide the relevant Service.

**Cookies**

We use a feature of your browser called “a cookie” to assign a user ID. Cookies identify your computer to our servers when you visit our web site and extend the functionality of the service offered in certain areas of our web site. You must have Cookies enabled on your web browser to use Macau.com.

**How do we protect your personal information?**

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical and technological security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

Particularly sensitive information such as your credit card number is not stored in a server that is connected to the Internet. All transmission of data for the purposes of billing and collections is done via encrypted transmission between Macau.com and the relevant financial institution or collection agent.

Your personal password is confidential and is encrypted to ensure its secrecy.

**Unsolicited commercial e-mail or “spam”**

“Spam” means unwanted marketing or commercial e-mail. We do not and have never supported or condoned sending spam e-mail.

Marketing mail from Macau.com will generally be “opt-in” / “opt-out”. This means that you should not receive any commercial or marketing e-mail from us unless you have requested it, that is, you have opted in. When you opt in, every piece of commercial e-mail will contain an opt-out option, or unsubscribe function. You can send us a message telling us you would prefer not to receive the mail again and we will respect your wishes.

We may also send you e-mail providing general information about services we provide or about goods or services that are available to you from other persons. Each time we do that, we will give you the opportunity to opt-out or unsubscribe should you choose not to receive further e-mails of that type.

**Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet**

We join the industry in recognizing that children, including young teens, may not be able to make informed choices about personal information requested online. Accordingly, we do not solicit or collect personally identifiable information from children and teenagers under eighteen and do not allow anyone else to do so on our affiliate web sites.

**Amendment of Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to amend the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy from time to time and without notice.

**This privacy policy is originally constructed in English and translated into Chinese. Every effort has been made to ensure the translation is accurate and consistent. In case of any disputes or inconsistencies, the English version shall prevail.**
