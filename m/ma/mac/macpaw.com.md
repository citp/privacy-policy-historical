# Privacy Policy for MacPaw Products: CleanMyMac 3, Hider 2, Gemini 2, and the rest

**Updated May 20, 2018**

At MacPaw, we care about the privacy of your data and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you and why, what we do with that information, and how we handle that information. We’ll also explain what choices you have with respect to the information. 

## Applicability Of This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to MacPaw desktop and mobile applications (collectively, the “Products”), MacPaw.com and other MacPaw websites (collectively, the “Sites”) and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with MacPaw. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Products, Sites or any other aspect of MacPaw’s business. 

This policy applies to the Company’s employees, contractors and officers.

The Company has a contract with all Data Processors that it uses in compliance with Article 28 & Article 29 of the GDPR, and ensures that all Data Processors are compliant with Data Protection Legislation.

The policy does not apply to third party services. Where third party services are used, and the third party is not a Data Processor, no Relevant Data (as defined below) is shared with them, or the Relevant Data has been anonymised such that the GDPR does not apply. Information collected by third parties is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.

In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Products (the “User Agreement”).

This policy applies to Relevant Data received and processed only.

Certain data about the devices you use to connect with MacPaw and your use of the Sites and/or Products are automatically logged in our systems, including:

  * Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the internet, our servers automatically collect data when you access or use our Sites and/or Products and record it in log files. This log data may include the IP address, browser type and settings, the date and time of use, information about browser configuration, language preferences, and cookie data.
  * Products and Sites Specific Data. This is information about the MacPaw Sites and/or Products you use and how you use them. We may also obtain data from our third-party partners and service providers to analyze how users use our Sites and/or Products.

### Third Party Data

Macpaw may receive data about Site visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful.

MacPaw does not sell or rent your Personal Data.

**Third Parties’ Applications and Products**

Some third-party applications and services that work with us may ask for permission to access your information. Those applications will provide you with notice and request your consent in order to obtain such access or information. Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully.

Some third parties’ embedded content or plugins on our Sites and/or Products, such as Facebook “Like” buttons, may allow their operators to learn that you have visited the Sites, and they may combine this knowledge with other data they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services that can identify you.

Data collected by third parties through these apps and plugins is subject to each parties’ own policies. We encourage you to read those policies and understand how other companies use your data.

**E-mailing by MacPaw**

From time to time, we may want to contact you with information about product announcements, software updates, and special offers. We also may want to contact you with information about products and services from our business partners. 

We only send marketing communications to users with your prior consent.

All MacPaw account holders will continue to receive transactional messages related to our Products, even if you unsubscribe from promotional emails.

## Data storage, transfer, retention, and deletion

### Data Storage and Transfers

Information submitted to MacPaw will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. When you use the Products on your computing device, user content you save will be stored locally on that device and synced with our servers. If you post or transfer any Information to or through our Sites and/or Products, you are agreeing to such information, including Personal Data and user content, being hosted and accessed in the United States.

### Duration of Information Storage

You can remove your Personal Data from MacPaw at any time by emailing us with the respective request: [support@macpaw.com](mailto:support@macpaw.com). However, we may keep some of your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations.

### Safeguards

When you give us personal information, we take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely.

Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.

Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and logical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our Products installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use in connection with our Site and Products.

The Company takes the security of your data very seriously and works to protect your data from loss, misuse and unauthorised access or disclosure.

All staff and officers who handle Relevant Data are aware of this policy and have been given training in how to correctly collect, process, store and delete data. The Company holds a log of when staff training was undertaken and updates it on an annual basis.

### Data Breaches

All breaches will be reported to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours, unless the data was anonymised or encrypted or if it has a particularly high risk.

Breaches of this policy by staff, contractors, officers of the Company will be dealt with under the Company’s grievance and disciplinary policy and may lead to a disciplinary sanction.

If MacPaw learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.

## Your Rights

MacPaw uses, processes, and stores Personal Data, as necessary to perform our contract with you, and based on our legitimate interests in order to provide the Products and Services. We rely on your consent to process Personal Data to send promotional emails and to place cookies on your devices. In some cases, MacPaw may process Personal Data pursuant to legal obligation or to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

The only reasons we will be able to deny your request is if we can show compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override your interest, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claims.
  * You can ask us to stop using your Personal Data, including when we use your Personal Data to send you marketing emails. We only send marketing communications to users located in the EEA with your prior consent, and you may withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within MacPaw emails and changing your contact preferences.
