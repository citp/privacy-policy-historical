## MacTalk Online Privacy Policy

  
MacTalk collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use the MacTalk Web site. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that MacTalk subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from our online users.  


  


## Information we collect and how we use it

  
When you visit the MacTalk Web site, MacTalk collects several forms of usage data, including:  
Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.  


  
Cookie data. When you visit the MacTalk Web site, MacTalk or one of our third-party partners may send one or more “cookies” small files containing a string of characters to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with MacTalk, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven’t registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.  


  
Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable MacTalk to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the MacTalk Web Site.  


  
Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on the MacTalk Web site.  
The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:

  


  

  * To improve the content and design of the MacTalk Web site.
  

  * To enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the site.
  

  * To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.
  

  * To help us understand more about the interests of our users, so that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest.
  



Portions of the MacTalk site can be used without registering or giving us any personal information such as (but not limited to) your name and e-mail address. However, MacTalk does collect personally identifying information regarding our online users, including in the following ways:

When you provide information about yourself or your company to MacTalk in connection with an offer, that information may be included in your MacTalk user record, if one exists.  


  
If you have previously registered with another Niche Media website and you begin to fill out certain forms on the MacTalk Web site, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your MacTalk user record. If you have provided information to MacTalk, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.  


  
The personal information we collect may be used in a number of ways, including the following:  


  


  

  * To improve the content of the MacTalk site, including by allowing MacTalk Publisher and Editor to consult with readers.
  

  * To communicate with users about registration and other customer service issues.
