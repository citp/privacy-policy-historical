				<div class="inner_view">
					<p>At Australian Macworld we understand that privacy is important, and we've created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information. </p>
<p>We revaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:</p>
<p>Privacy Officer<br>Niche Media Pty Ltd.<br>170 Dorcas Street<br>South Melbourne VIC 3205<br>AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>Or to <a href="mailto:austmacworld@niche.com.au">austmacworld@niche.com.au</a></p>
<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our Web site will contain a special notice about the changes. Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Australian Macworld Online Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Australian Macworld collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use the Australian Macworld Web site. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that Australian Macworld print edition subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from our online users. </p>
<p><strong>Information we collect and how we use it</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Australian Macworld Web site, Australian Macworld collects several forms of usage data, including:</p>
<p>Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.</p>
<p>Cookie data. When you visit the Australian Macworld Web site, Australian Macworld or one of our IDG affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies"ï¿½small files containing a string of charactersï¿½to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with Australian Macworld, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven't registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.</p>
<p>Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable Australian Macworld to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the Australian Macworld site.</p>
<p>Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on the Australian Macworld Web site.</p>
<p>The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:</p>
<ul>	<li>To improve the content and design of the Australian Macworld Web site.</li>	<li>To enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the site.</li>	<li>To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.</li>	<li>To help us understand more about the interests of our users, so that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest.</li></ul><p>Many portions of the Australian Macworld site can be used without registering or giving us any personal information such as (but not limited to) your name and e-mail address. However, Australian Macworld does collect personally identifying information regarding our online users, including in the following ways:</p>
<p>When you provide it to us, such as (but not limited to) by entering a contest, becoming a registered member, signing up for a newsletter or tutorial, or otherwise contacting us.When you provide it to a company that powers a portion of our site or provides a special feature, such as a contest registration, that appears on our site.When you provide information about yourself or your company to Australian Macworld in connection with a subscription order, that information may be included in your Australian Macworld user record, if one exists.</p>
<p>If you have previously registered with another Niche Media website and you begin to fill out certain forms on the Australian Macworld Web site, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your Australian Macworld user record. If you have provided information to Australian Macworld, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.</p>
<p>The personal information we collect may be used in a number of ways, including the following:</p>
<ul>	<li>To improve the content of the Australian Macworld site, including by allowing Australian Macworld's editors to consult with readers.</li>	<li>To communicate with users about registration and other customer service issues.</li>	<li>To promote products and services of Australian Macworld or Niche Media Pty Ltd.</li>	<li>To conduct research surveys on behalf of Australian Macworld, Niche Media Pty Ltd, and its subsidiaries and affiliates.</li></ul><p><strong>Information sharing</strong></p>
<p>Australian Macworld may share aggregated, non-personal information, such as Web site traffic figures, with third parties. This aggregated information does not identify you individually. We may share personal information with your consent or in order to provide products or services you have requested. In addition, by using the site you agree that we may also share personal information in any of the following circumstances:</p>

Australian Macworld and its parent and affiliate companies are not responsible for the third party's actions or policies. Portions of the site operated by third parties normally include a "Powered by" logo naming the third party, or have forms that include links to the third party's privacy policy.</li>	<li>We may transfer personal information from your user record to your subscriber record, if one exists, provided that we also transfer any preferences you have set for how that personal information is used.
