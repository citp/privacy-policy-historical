Pixel tags and cookies are used to collect non-personal data, such as the name of your internet service provider, the IP address of the computer you are using, the type of browser software and operating system that you use, the date and time you access our website, the website address, if any, from which you linked directly to our website, the website address, if any, to which you travel from our website, your home page customization preferences, a general geographic location (such as country and city) from which you accessed our website, and other similar traffic-related information.

efforts and with other marketers whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Mack Weldon also participates in marketing cooperatives. As part of our participation in these marketing cooperatives, we may disclose your name and postal address (but not your email address or payment card information) so that other select reputable companies can mail you information about their products that may interest you. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please opt-out by updating your “My Profile” preferences here: [My Profile](http://www.mackweldon.com/account/edit).
