		<h1>Macquarie Privacy Policy</h1>

		      <p>Central to the success of Macquarie is our commitment to our clients. We honour without reservation our obligation to respect and protect the privacy of the personal information of individuals with whom we deal.</p>


		<h6>The information we collect</h6>

<p>Whenever it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we only collect information about you directly from you.</p>

<p>We only collect personal information about you which is reasonably necessary to:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide you quality products or services</li>

<li>consider applications and approaches you make to us</li>

<li>maintain your contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>We generally hold personal information relating to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the products and services we provide or have provided to you</li>

<li>your financial interests and sometimes your financial position</li>

<li>your contact details.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not generally collect sensitive information about you unless required by applicable laws or rules. Sensitive information includes information relating to:</p>

<ul>
<li>race</li>

<li>political or religious beliefs</li>

<li>sexual preferences</li>

<li>criminal convictions</li>

<li>membership of professional or trade associations or unions</li>

<li>health information.</li>
</ul>

<p>We collect health information where we offer products with an insurance component to our customers. We do not use or share that information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of a customer's policy, claim or account, or as otherwise disclosed to the customer when the information was collected.</p>

<h6>How that information is used</h6>

<p>We only use and disclose personal information about you for the purpose for which it was disclosed to us or related purposes which would reasonably be expected without your permission.<br>
<br>
For example, we may from time to time use your personal information to inform you of investment opportunities or to provide information about products and services which we expect may be of interest to you. However, we do respect your right to ask us not to do this.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We do not sell personal information to other organisations to allow them to do this.</p>

<p>We may disclose personal information to service providers who provide services in connection with our products and services or we may provide information about you to your nominated financial adviser with your permission.</p>

<h6>Keeping information accurate and up to date</h6>

<p>We take all reasonable steps to ensure that all information we hold is as accurate as is possible.&nbsp;You are able to contact us at any time and ask for its correction if you feel the information we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

<h6>Keeping information secure</h6>

<p>We use security procedures and the latest technology to protect the information we hold. Access to and use of personal information within Macquarie is appropriately limited to prevent misuse or unlawful disclosure of the information.</p>

<p>If other organisations provide support services, we require them to appropriately safeguard the privacy of the information provided to them.</p>

<p>Where the personal information we collect is no longer required, we delete the information or permanently de-identify it.</p>

<h6>How you can access your information</h6>

<p>You can contact us to request access to your information. In normal circumstances we will give you full access to your information. However, there may be some legal or administrative reasons to deny access. If access is denied, we will provide you with the reason why.</p>

<li>traffic monitoring - we use tracking companies to gather information about how people are using the Macquarie site, this information includes time of visit, pages visited, and some system information about the type of computer you are using. We use this information to enhance the content and services offered on the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cookies may also be used for other purposes on the Macquarie site but in each case none of the information collected can be used to personally identify you.</p>
