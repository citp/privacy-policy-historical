**Australian Macworld Online Privacy Policy**

Australian Macworld collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use the Australian Macworld Web site. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that Australian Macworld print edition subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from our online users. 

**Information we collect and how we use it**

When you visit the Australian Macworld Web site, Australian Macworld collects several forms of usage data, including:

Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.

Cookie data. When you visit the Australian Macworld Web site, Australian Macworld or one of our IDG affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies"ï¿½small files containing a string of charactersï¿½to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with Australian Macworld, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven't registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.

Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable Australian Macworld to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the Australian Macworld site.

Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on the Australian Macworld Web site.

The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:

  * To improve the content and design of the Australian Macworld Web site.
  * To enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the site.
  * To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.
  * To help us understand more about the interests of our users, so that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest.

If you have previously registered with another Niche Media website and you begin to fill out certain forms on the Australian Macworld Web site, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your Australian Macworld user record. If you have provided information to Australian Macworld, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.

The personal information we collect may be used in a number of ways, including the following:

  * To improve the content of the Australian Macworld site, including by allowing Australian Macworld's editors to consult with readers.
