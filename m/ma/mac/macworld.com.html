<b>Cookies</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited and to allow easy access to restricted areas of the Web site. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. The Mac Publishing Web sites use cookies to track user traffic in aggregate. Our third-party adserver may also set or recognize a cookie in the course of serving an ad to you on this site. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use Macworld.com.

<b>Clear Gifs</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
This site uses clear gifs, or pixel tags, provided by our adserving company to help manage our on-line advertising. These clear GIFS allow our adserving company to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable (It does not include your name, address, telephone number or email address). For more information about our adserving company or for your choices about not having this anonymous information used please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net">click here</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
<b>E-newsletters</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
Mac Publishing offers several electronic newsletters to users.  Mac Publishing gathers the e-mail addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page or by unsubscribing in the newsletter subscription area of our Web site. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. You may correct your member information or select the option not to receive additional mailings by going to <a href="http://www.macworld.com/newsletters/">http://www.macworld.com/newsletters/</a>.
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
<b>Use of the Information</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
Mac Publishing uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
As stated above, Mac Publishing uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to move seamlessly through the Web site. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
We use tracking information to determine which areas our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. Mac Publishing does not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
Mac Publishing creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because Mac Publishing doesn't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad.
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
Mac Publishing uses DoubleClick to serve our online ads. Per our agreement with DoubleCLick, they cannot use any information gathered from Mac Publishing ads to open up a file on your browsing habits. Although DoubleClick does give us information about such things as ad clickthroughs, it is strictly in the aggregate, i.e., how many people clicked on this ad, how many times that ad was viewed, and not the actions of any specific individual.
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
Mac Publishing does allow select advertisers to mail promotions to magazine subscribers and newsletter recipients who have given us their permission to do so. All promotions are pre-approved by Mac Publishing and all mailings are conducted by a reputable third party mail house to ensure the names are not mis-used or used more than once. Our users are asked at the time when their information is collected if they would prefer to not receive promotions from our partners. You may change this designation at anytime. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
While Mac Publishing will seek to require third parties with which it has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties.
