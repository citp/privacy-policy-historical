# Privacy Policy | Mac360

Mac360 is a site developed and maintained by Alexis Kayhill and Ron McElfresh. We are committed to protect your privacy. The information we collect while you are visiting Mac360 is used to provide you with a more personalized and richer experience. Please read further for details.

## Your IP Address

Your IP address is a unique identifier Mac360 uses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site tracking. We also use your IP address to gather broad and general demographic information, none of which is personal or identifiable to you.

## Cookies

We use a feature on your browser which is called a _cookie_. A cookie is a small piece of information stored on your computer. It assigns a unique identification number to your computer and helps us maintain your preferences between visits to provide a personalized experience for you.

We use cookies to tell us whether or not you have visited our site before and to track click-throughs to any of the site’s advertisements. 

We also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as anonymous session numbers, with cookies.

Mac360 allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on Mac360’s pages to set and access cookies on your computer. We do not control cookies from third-party advertisers. A third party company’s use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the privacy policy of this site. Advertisers or other companies do not have to access to cookies or cookie information from Mac360. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

## What About Personal Information? Do You Collect That?

We do not house or collect any personal information about you unless you knowingly and willingly provide it.

## Membership Registration

Mac360 may provide a registration process through which you voluntarily sign up to access the members-only features of our site. During the registration process, we may ask for your name, e-mail address, how you got to know us, your age range, your ZIP code and other pertinent information.

Also, to make sure that nobody else can access our members-only features using your name or identity, we may ask that you create a unique user name with a password. This is optional.

## Newsletter Subscription

Mac360 may provide newsletters for visitors to our sites. When you subscribe to our free newsletters or become a member through registration, we will ask for an e-mail address from you. You may opt out of receiving future mailings or cancel your subscription(s) at any time.

## Contests and Promotions

When you enter a contest or take part in a promotion, we may ask for your name, mailing address, and e-mail address. Should a third party sponsor the contest or promotion, that party may have access to this information. We need this information to notify our winners, and, when applicable, ship the winner’s prizes.

## Does Mac360 Ever Share Information with Others?

Disclosure of Information to Outside Parties: Mac360 does not and will not share your _personal_ information with any outside parties unless you have knowingly and willingly consented to do so—( _for example, by entering a contest, promotion or sweepstakes for which we would publish a list of winners_ ). We may collect demographic and profile data, which is aggregated and shared with advertisers. Here’s an example of what our advertisers would receive. “Of the 25,371 clicks your banner received, 38% of the those were by users between the ages of 25-34”.

## Links to Outside Third Parties

Mac360 may establish relationships with reputable business partners by creating a link between our sites. Mac360 chooses its business partners carefully. We are not, however, responsible for the content, maintenance or privacy policies of those sites. Once you click over to a third-party site, we encourage you to check their privacy policy.

Mac360 may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than the information practices of Mac360. 

Users who click over to a third-party site from a link on Mac360 must be aware that Mac360 makes no warranties with regard to that site’s policies or business practices. Mac360 is not responsible for any transactions that occur between the user and the third-party site.

Please consult the other site’s privacy policy as Mac360 has no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Should a user purchase any products or services from that third-party site, the user must contact the third-party site directly regarding any disputes that might occur, including, but not limited to: delayed shipping, missing products, damaged goods, or pricing or billing discrepancies.

Mac360 is not responsible for the actions of any third-party site.

## Children’s Guidelines

Mac360 does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet use. Also, we strongly encourage parents to help us enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children to never provide personal information on our web sites without permission.

## Security

Mac360 has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. In some instances, we are able to keep your personal information safe and secure by utilizing Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encryption technology. For maximum security, we may use a secure server that encrypts all your ordering information, including your name, address, and credit-card number when applicable.
