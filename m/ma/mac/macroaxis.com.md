Registration on Macroaxis is strictly voluntary. You do get some cool information and access to certain great features if you do register, but membership is not necessary to get the public information available on site. Macroaxis collects personally identifiable information that you provide to us. This includes (at your discretion) your **name** , an **email address** and an **organization**. Our software uses this information to personalize and manage the Macroaxis website for you.

## We'll Keep You In Touch

When you choose to register with us, Macroaxis logs you in automatically using your email address. This makes it easier for you as you don't have to create and remember a login identifier. The use of your email address for login also allows Macroaxis the chance to email you a new password in case you forget or lost your old one. 

Macroaxis gives you the option of receiving emails from us. We'll keep you in loop about new features available on our service. We notify our users only for big release so you will not get more than 1 email in every quarter. If you like, you can opt out any time. Our emails are sent from a Macroaxis address and are sent to your real email address. Every email that we send has an instruction how to opt out from our notifications, so you can be unsubscribed when you want. We do hate spam and suspect that you do too. 

## Absolutely No Sharing

What's yours is yours. "You Info" that you chose to share with us is not going anywhere off of our site. We won't sell your info to anyone.
