### OWC Corporate Data Storage Device Decommissioning Policy

OWC takes data security very seriously. It is extremely important to OWC that all of our customers know that information is secure and protected. This includes when equipment with electronic data storage devices, such as hard drives, exhaust their usefulness and require decommissioning.

As always, OWC strives to ensure that all electronics are used to their maximum capacity and lifespan. However, when a piece of equipment has been slated for decommissioning, OWC ensures the vital protection of all data collected by pulling all data storage devices from the equipment, storing the data for retention purposes for a specified period of time, per our corporate business needs and requirements. Upon lapse of such period, all data storage devices are reformatted exactly to Department of Defense formatting specifications. Those devices that are deemed unusable in any capacity, after reformatting, are certifiably destroyed.

OWC prides itself in ensuring that our policies provide maximum protection to our customers. Should you have any questions about our policy, please contact [Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/Service/cs_email.cfm).
