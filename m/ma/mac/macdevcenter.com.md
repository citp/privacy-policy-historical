### Information O'Reilly gathers and tracks

O'Reilly collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with us. 

### Personal information

We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on how you contact us:

  * When you sign up online to receive O'Reilly newsletters, product and company news, and to participate in talkbacks on our sites you must provide your name, email address, and a password. We never sell or rent your email address or other personally identifiable information you provide us under these circumstances.
  * When you register for an O'Reilly conference, or sign up for a conference email list, we will send you email announcements and updates about O'Reilly conferences. We send conference brochures to past conference attendees.
  * When you order books directly from us, or request book catalogs, we add you to our snailmail list, and we'll send you catalogs and other marketing pieces.
  * When you enter a contest or sweepstakes, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and communicate with entrants about the results.



We share customer information only with affiliated companies (see <http://www.oreilly.com/affiliates.html>) and as described below:

  * With third parties we retain to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, managing mailing lists, and delivering packages. These parties are restricted from using your information for any other purpose.
  * We release personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of O'Reilly Media, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



### Aggregated tracking information

We analyze visitors' use of our sites by tracking information such as pageviews, traffic flow, search terms, and click through. We use this information to improve our sites. We also share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners. We do not share any information with advertisers that can identify an individual user.

We use Omniture SiteCatalyst, a third party web analytics service to improve our web site performance and user experience. We use this information to improve usability on our sites and to help support our customers online needs. Omniture SiteCatalyst does not reveal any personally identifiable information, such as names or email address.
