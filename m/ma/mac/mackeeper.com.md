#### "Camera Tracker" and "Microphone Tracker"

The Camera and Microphone Tracker features are designed to detect the usage of camera and microphone (both built-in and external) by other applications on your device. These features will help you detect unauthorized intrusion into your private life by unknown applications.

After you activate these features, they will notify you if some application starts using your camera and/or microphone. You can allow your camera and microphone to be always used by applications that you believe are safe, so no notifications will be shown next time for these apps.

MacKeeper does not track and/or save any audio or video recordings, but it indicates the moment when the camera and/or microphone becomes activated by any application that is installed on your device.

#### “Anti-Theft Service”

Anti-Theft is one of security features of MacKeeper™. By default Anti-Theft is disabled. In case you enable Anti-Theft service it will automatically collect your computer's IP address and its geographical position every hour.

You can report your computer STOLEN or LOST on your [Kromtech account](http://account.mackeeper.com/), in open Anti-Theft tab. Then it will collect IP address, track location, trace-route and make snapshots using the built-in iSight camera or any external camera every five minutes.

Automatically gathered data collected by the Anti-Theft service is completely anonymous. Therefore even if it is revealed to some third parties, this won’t affect your privacy.

#### “Internet Security”

MacKeeper™ Internet Security feature is powered by Avira’s antivirus engine. In case of installing our Internet Security service, which includes Real Time Safe Browsing, Automatic Security Updates and Real Time Antivirus Scan you confirm that you have read, understood and agreed to Avira [EULA](https://www.avira.com/en/end-user-license-agreement-terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.avira.com/en/general-privacy/).
