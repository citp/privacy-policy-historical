<h6> <strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h6>
<h6>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation 
  of our site, we gather certain types of information about our users, and we 
  would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it 
  and how to correct or change the information.</h6>
<h6><strong>Information Collected by This Site</strong></h6>
<h6>We collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal 
  data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information 
  about traffic patterns on the site, for example how many users log into the 
  site on a daily basis).</h6>
<h6><strong>Personal Data</strong></h6>
<h6>Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to the site. For 
  example in registering for email notification services, answering surveys, purchasing 
  items from the site, sending email to the site, registering for contests and 
  other promotional opportunities, message boards and chat areas.<br>
  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children 
  (defined herein as minors younger than 13 years of age) without obtaining parental 
  consent. Before registering for an account to use the services of the Web site, 
  we ask that all minors have their parents read our Privacy Policy. Before and 
  during the registration process, we encourage all minors to include a parent 
  or guardian in the process.</h6>
<h6><strong>Aggregate Data</strong></h6>
<h6>When visitors come to the Web site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, 
  among other things, which pages were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." 
  Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, operating 
  system and browser software used by each visitor to the Web site.<br>
  The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us diagnose problems 
  with our server, administer the Web site, identify the most popular areas of 
  the Web site, and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. 
  In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform 
  them of the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements.</h6>
<h6> <strong>Who this data may be shared with</strong></h6>
<h6>Our site uses both the personal and aggregated information collected for multiple 
  purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the site, to customize 
  the content and/or layout of the site for each individual user and to notify 
  users about updates to the site or promotional offers or opportunities that 
  we believe will be of interest to you.<br>
  We share aggregated information collected from the site with third parties for 
  both advertising and promotional purposes. We also provide statistical information 
  based on this data to advertisers and other current and potential business partners.</h6>
<h6><strong>Data collection&nbsp;regarding minors</strong></h6>
<h6><strong>Children and Privacy</strong></h6>
<h6>We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, 
  and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. At various 
  places on the sites, we ask whether users are under the age of 18, or 13, for 
  example when requesting personal information from a user, we may ask for parental 
  consent. We rely on users to be truthful in responding to these questions.</h6>
<h6><strong>Individuals Under 13</strong></h6>
<h6>No information should be submitted to or posted on the site by users under 
  the age of 13 years without consent of their parent or guardian. The site does 
  not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source 
  collected from users under the age of 13 to any third party for any purpose 
  whatsoever unless disclosed during collection. Users under the age of 13 are 
  asked not to participate in contests or other promotional opportunities, and 
  the site does not knowingly collect information from users under the age of 
  13.</h6>
<h6><strong>Individuals 13 Through 17</strong></h6>
<h6>We request that children under the age of 18 do not submit or post information 
  to the site without a parent or guardian's consent. The site may collect information, 
  including personally identifying information, from users between the ages of 
  13 and 17, and this information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes 
  by the site and which may be shared with prescreened third parties, with the 
  permission of the user. A user or their parent or guardian may stop the use 
  - either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her registration information 
  online as described above in "Information Collected by The Site."</h6>
<h6><strong>Cookies</strong></h6>
<h6>Our site also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data 
  file that most major websites write into your hard drive for record keeping 
  purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow a website to measure activity on 
  their site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your 
  passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only 
  parts of the site without re-registering. We do not use cookies to retrieve 
  information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except 
  for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e. during membership 
  registration or a contest), we do not use information transferred through cookies 
  for any promotional or marketing purposes, and that information is not shared 
  with third parties.</h6>
<h6>You may occasionally get cookies from advertisers on the site, which is standard 
  on the Internet. These cookies are outside the control of our site, and are 
  not subject to our privacy policy. Most browsers are initially set to accept 
  cookies. If you'd prefer, you may be able to set yours to refuse cookies or 
  to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some 
  parts of the site, such as the member-only areas and shopping, contest and game 
  areas, will not function properly if you do so.</h6>
<h6><strong>How You can Access or Correct Information<br>
  (Opt out or unsubscribe functions)</strong></h6>
<h6>If you would like to have your personally identifiable information changed 
  or removed from our database, please contact us at webmaster@macdailynews.com, 
  and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind, 
  however, that there will be residual information that will remain within our 
  databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such 
  personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used 
  for commercial purposes; however we reserve the right, from time to time, to 
  recontact former customers or users of this Web site.</h6>
<h6><strong>Message Board and Chat</strong></h6>
<h6>Please remember that information posted to message boards and chat areas becomes 
  public information. Use caution when posting. Users under the age of 18 should 
  be especially careful not to provide any personally identifying information 
  while using chat rooms or message boards. As set forth in our Terms and Conditions 
  of use, users of chat rooms and message boards must follow acceptable standards 
  of behavior when posting messages online.</h6>
<h6><strong>Links to other sites</strong></h6>
<h6>It is important to note that this site contains links to other sites, and 
  that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as our site. For instance, 
  if you click on an advertisement on the site, this will take you away from the 
  site and to an entirely different site. This can include links from advertisers, 
  content providers and partners who may use the sites' logo and or style as a 
  result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to 
  you, and may collect data and make uses of it that the sites would not.<br>
  Our web site may contain links to other Internet web sites, including co-branded 
  or other affiliated sites that may or may not be owned or operated by us. Unless 
  otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
  or the content of such web sites, including such sites' use of any information 
  (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors 
  to the web site click through links to those sites. Even though such information 
  might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar 
  with the privacy practices of those sites.</h6>
<h6><strong>Security</strong></h6>
<h6>As effective as any security measure implemented by us may be, no security 
  system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor 
  can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being 
  transmitted to us over the Internet.</h6>
<h6><strong>Law&nbsp; Enforcement</strong></h6>
<h6>We reserve the right to release any and all information contained within our 
  access logs concerning any visitor or member when that visitor or member is 
  in violation of our Terms of Service or other published guidelines, or partakes 
  (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, even without 
  a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to release such information in 
  response to discovery requests, or in response to any circumstance which we, 
  in our sole discretion, deem an emergency. We cooperate with law enforcement 
  agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal 
  activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity 
  to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution.</h6>
<h6><strong>USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF USE AND 
  PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></h6>
<h6>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by posting a revised 
  privacy policy. The revised policies will be posted here.</h6>
