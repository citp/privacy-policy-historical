# MacLegion.com Privacy Policy

## Hate spam? So do we!

When you purchase an offer or register for a free promotional event from MacLegion, we share your name and email address with the respective developer/publisher/manufacturer (MacLegion partner). This is done for two reasons; to accurately register you as a valid buyer of the product with the MacLegion partner; to generate your serial numbers (many serial numbers are based on your name and/or email address to protect against piracy). This ensures that you’ll receive full after sales support and upgrade paths from all MacLegion partners as though you’d purchased the software directly from them. As a result, MacLegion partners may email you with first-party offers from time to time as they would any of their customers; all partners must support and respect any opt-out requests from future communications made by you, and are also required to provide opt-out links in any correspondence they send you.

## We respect your privacy!
