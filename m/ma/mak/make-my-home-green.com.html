					<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
					Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes 
					a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation 
					below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to 
					collect information about how our Web site is used. 
					Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may 
					include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time 
					spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before 
					and just after our Web site. </span></p>
					<p><strong>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">How Do 
					We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? </span>
					</strong>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
					Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes 
					of administering our business activities, providing the 
					products and services you requested, to process your 
					payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our marketing 
					and promotional efforts and improve our content and service 
					offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, 
					services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve 
					our site and better tailor it to meet your needs. </span>
					</p>
					<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">
					Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on 
					an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or 
					business information will not be shared with parties except 
					as required by law. </span></p>
					<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">
					Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to 
					notify you about important changes to our Website, new 
					services, and special offers we think you will find 
					valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish 
					to receive these offers by emailing us at the link provided 
					on the newsletter. <br>
					<br>
					</span><strong>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">What Are 
					Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
					A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes 
					an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, 
					that site's computer asks your computer for permission to 
					store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically 
					designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own 
					cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow 
					it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits 
					a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, 
					not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are 
					usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer 
					not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of 
					your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your 
					browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of 
					our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the 
					users. </span><b>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">A cookie 
					cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass 
					on computer viruses. </span></b></p>
					<p><strong>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">How Do 
					We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
					As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies 
					to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we 
					also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more 
					than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with 
					our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the 
					aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which 
					parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather 
					feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve 
					our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal 
					information about you and we do not intentionally store any 
					personal information that your browser provided to us in 
					your cookies. </span></p>
					<p><strong>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">IP 
					Addresses</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
					IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are 
					connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that 
					is used by computers on the network to identify your 
					computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our 
					web server as part of demographic and profile data known as 
					traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you 
					request) can be sent to you. </span></p>
					<p><strong>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Sharing 
					and Selling Information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
					We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the 
					information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as 
					email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to 
					the extent it is necessary to process transactions or 
					provide services that you have requested. </span></p>
					<p><strong>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">How Can 
					You Access and Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
					You may request access to all your personally identifiable 
					information that we collect online and maintain in our 
					database by emailing us at the usual address. </span></p>
					<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">
					What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
					</span></b>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">We may 
					disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in 
					other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law 
					requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We 
					may also disclose account information when we have reason to 
					believe that disclosing this information is necessary to 
					identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who 
					may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the 
					safety of our users and the Public. </span></p>
					<p><strong>
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">What 
					About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
					We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web 
					sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or 
					content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites 
					are provided solely as pointers to information on topics 
					that may be useful to the users of our Web site. <br>

					Please remember that when you use a link to go from our 
					Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer 
					in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web

					is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please 
					read over those rules and policies before proceeding. </span>

					<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">
					Please note that your information will be stored and

					as name and shipping address), and demographic information 
					(such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be 
					used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey 
					information will be used for purposes of monitoring or 
					improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </span></p>
