# Disclaimer & Privacy Policy | MakeUseOf.com

  * MakeUseOf.com recommends dozens of [cool websites](http://www.makeuseof.com/) and free products/services on a daily basis. In most cases we check the services and apps thoroughly beforehand. However sometimes we are not able to completely check the app as much as we would like to. Hence we would like to state that we can’t be held liable/responsible for any loss/damage/discomfort occurred as a result of using a MakeUseOf recommended product/service.
  * Any personal information you provide to us including and similar to your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address will not be released, sold, or rented to any entities or individuals outside of MakeUseOf.com. The only possible exception to this is if you enter a MakeUseOf Giveaway contest. In some of these contests, it is clearly stated in the contest terms and conditions that your email address **may** be passed to the contest sponsor so they can contact you directly. Entering the contest implies that you give your consent to this happening.
  * Other Internet sites or services that may be accessible through MakeUseOf.com have separate data and privacy practices independent of us, and therefore we disclaim any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions.
  * For newsletter management and distribution MakeUseOf uses services offered by [Aweber](http://www.makeuseof.com/) and [Google’s Feedburner](http://feedburner.google.com/). While these are established companies that are known to be reliable when it comes to keeping their servers secure we can’t be held repsponsible/liable for any breaches or customer data loss that may occur at those companies.
  * MakeUseOf.com will **never** ask for credit card details and request that you do not enter them on any of the forms on MakeUseOf.com.
  * MakeUseOf.com is not responsible for the content of external internet sites. You are advised to read the privacy policy of external sites before disclosing any personal information.
  * A “cookie” is a small data text file that is placed in your browser and allows MakeUseOf.com to recognize you each time you visit this site (customisation etc). Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information, and MakeUseOf.com **does not** use cookies to collect personal information.
  * Cookies may also be used by third party content providers such as newsfeeds and ad providers. Third party ad networks that are serving ads on MakeUseOf.com may be placing and reading cookies on your browsers, or using web beacons to collect information as a result of ad serving.
  * Also keep in mind that third party ads served on MakeUseOf.com (i.e. from Google Adsense) are likely to be customised to reflect user’s (in this case you) interests. Please contact those vendors and others directly if you have any questions about their privacy policies.
