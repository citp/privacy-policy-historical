	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users.&nbsp; This Policy describes the collection and use of users’ personal information on the Making Fun Services.

	<p><strong><a name="2">2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON MAKING FUN SERVICES</a></strong></p>

By way of example, gameplay logs containing usernames, timestamps and gameplay data may be made available over the public internet for players to download and analyze for their enjoyment.

	<p><em>Making Fun&nbsp;Collected Information</em></p>

	<p><strong>Making Fun&nbsp;Site Activity Information.&nbsp;</strong>When users access the Making Fun Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits.&nbsp; For example, in order to permit your connection to the Making Fun Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.&nbsp; If you access the Making Fun Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.&nbsp; We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier.&nbsp; Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so that Making Fun can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site.&nbsp; We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Making Fun Services, such as pages you have visited, game sessions you have played, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen.</p>

	<p>Third parties that support the Making Fun Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.&nbsp; Making Fun does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.&nbsp; For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>
