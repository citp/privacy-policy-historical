Cookies are small text files which the Website transmits to the cookie file of the Internet browser on your terminal device and which are kept there for a later retrieval, so that the Website can, inter alia, remember who you are. Typically, a cookie will include the name of the domain from where it was set, the “lifetime” of the cookie and a unique identifier. The following types of cookies are used on the Website: 

  * Session Cookies: These are temporary cookies, which are kept in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website and which are necessary, in particular, in order that you can use the Website and make downloads from it.

  * Cookies in connection with Google Analytics, as described in section 3 f) below.



If you do not want to accept cookies of the Website, you can deactivate them and object to the access to information stored before by setting your Internet browser accordingly.

#### f) Use of Google Analytics

This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ( **"Google"** ). 

Google Analytics uses so called "cookies", i.e., small text files that are stored on the computer of the user and make it possible to analyse the Website usage. Usually the information stored in cookies about the Website usage is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and saved there. On makandra’s Website IP anonymization is enabled so that Google will shorten the user’s IP address within a member state of the European Union or a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there so that data processing might take place outside the European Union. In such case personal data collected by means of Google Analytics will be transferred to the USA. Google Inc. is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (see <https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI>) and thus has provided the legal requirements for ensuring an adequate level of data protection for the provision of the Google Analytics service by means of processing on behalf of the controller. 

The user can object to the use of Google Analytics and prevent the storage of cookies by respective browser settings as explained above under section 3 c). The user can also stop data (incl. his IP address) created by cookies and associated with his website usage from being sent to Google or processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser add-on for deactivation of the Google Analytics JavaScrip available at the following link <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

By visiting the Website Google receives information that you have accessed the respective sub-site of the Website.

If you are logged-in with Google your data will be assigned to your user account. If you do not want such assignment to your profile with Google please log-out from Google before accessing the sub-site where reCAPTCHA is integrated. Google will store your data as user profile and will use them for advertisement, market research and/or in order to design the website in a needs-based manner. Such assessment will be carried out in particular (even for users which are not logged-in) for the provision of needs-based advertisement and in order to inform other users of such social network about your activities on our Website. You have a right to object to such creation of user profiles and you have to contact Google for exercising such right. 

Google LLC is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (see <https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI>) and thus has provided the legal requirements for ensuring an adequate level of data protection for the provision of the reCAPTCHA service.
