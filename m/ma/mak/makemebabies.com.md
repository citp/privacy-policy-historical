### Luxand Technologies Help Couples Generate Pictures of Their Babies

Couples spend hours discussing what their baby would look like. Will the baby look more like her mom or dad? Studying family photo albums and trying to collate pictures could help concerned couples during the last century. Today, there is a better, simpler and more precise alternative.

[Baby Morphing](http://luxand.com/), a new technology developed by [Luxand](http://luxand.com/), helps parents, couples and friends to see what their baby would look like based on their pictures alone. The technology only needs photos of the couple’s faces to generate a quality picture of their baby. The technology makes it really easy for couples to create and share babies’ pictures. Yet, Baby Morphing does not stop there, and allows making pictures of babies by taking only one photograph and mixing it with a stock photo of a celebrity or a member of a dating site, depending on the application.

### Who and Why Uses Baby Morphing

Family-oriented Web sites can offer couples a free peek into the future of a family, allowing them to see how their baby would look like. Celebrity sites would allow visitors realize their fantasies of having a baby from their crush. Dating services and marriage agencies add value to their services by allowing visitors have some extra unique fun. Baby Morphing is truly universal in its applications as the technology is fully automated, and works without any human interaction.

### Technology Background

The [Baby Morphing](http://luxand.com/) technology revolutionizes the way in which baby’s pictures are generated. The technology generates high-resolution, high-quality faces of babies from facial shots of a couple of people. Baby Morphing provides consistent quality results that do not depend on the quality of the pictures of the parents. Instead of simply mixing the faces or morphing one picture into another half way as virtually all competing technologies do, Baby Morphing works in a different, unique fashion. Baby Morphing detects faces of the parents on the two pictures, recognizes their facial features and classifies characteristic features of each face. After that, the technology generates a picture of a baby’s face by averaging those characteristics.

[Baby Morphing](http://luxand.com/) always provides results of the highest quality regardless of the quality of the parents’ pictures. Even supplying low-resolution scratched black-and-white photos results in a high-quality color rendering!
