	What information is collected

	Personal Information
Your privacy is important to us. Depending on how you use the Sites or engage in the other services described below, we may ask you to share Personal Information with us. &quot;Personal Information&quot; includes, for example, your name; home and/or business address; e-mail address; telephone number; credit card and other payment information; and demographic information and/or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.
MAKE UP FOR EVER will ask you for information, including some Personal Information, if you use one of several services:
Sign up for e-mail or catalogs: In order to receive our e-mail blasts, including information about new products, events, tips and more, you need to share your e-mail address and name. You do not have to sign up for e-mail to browse the Website. If you sign up to receive our catalog or Academy information, you need to share your e-mail address, name, mailing address and other optional information regarding your preferences and interests.
Becoming a registered user: In order to register, you need to share some Personal Information, such as your e-mail address. You do not have to be a registered user to browse the Website.
Sweepstakes, contest and surveys: You may be asked to provide Personal Information in order to enter a sweepstakes or contest, or answer a survey. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes or contest, or answer a survey, you will become a registered user (if you aren't one already). We may also ask you for some demographic information, such as your age. If you choose not to answer, you may not be able to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or survey. We may sometimes use a third party application on Facebook or other third party website to host a sweepstakes, contest or promotion. In those instances, the information you provide will be submitted to the third party and their privacy policy will govern the use and disclosure of the information you submit.
Ratings &amp; Reviews and other interactive services: We may offer several interactive services, including Ratings &amp; Reviews services. This Privacy Policy will govern your use of those services. If you want to use any of these interactive services, you will become a registered user (if you aren't already one) and any personal information you submit will become part of your profile, as maintained by Us.

	Website Usage Information

	Cookies
We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive and can be used to collect information about where you travel on our Website and what you look at on our Website. They may store the information in your shopping cart, your username and/or password, or your IP address. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Website.
	You can control how your browser handles cookies received from websites. You can choose to refuse all cookies, or to be prompted before a cookie is saved to your hard drive, or to only accept Cookies from certain websites that you designate. By refusing to accept cookies from MAKE UP FOR EVER, you may not be able to use some of the features and functionality available on the Website.

	Clear GIFs
We may use &quot;clear GIFs&quot; (aka &quot;Web beacons&quot; or &quot;pixel tags&quot;) or similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our communications with you to enable Us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail that communicates to Us whether you viewed an email that we sent you or visited a certain page on our Website. A clear GIF may enable Us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.

	IP Address and Clickstream Data
Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit Us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to Us (e.g., another Website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the Website you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider.
Any or all of these activities with regard to Website usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers.

	Third Party Ad Servers.
We may use the services of one or more third party advertising companies. If We do, these third party advertising companies may also collect information from your activities on the Website as well as other sites for the purpose of providing advertisements and other content that is customized to your interests and preferences. This means that our ads may appear on participating web sites based upon your browsing activity. To allow us to offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we may use and allow our third party advertising companies to use the technologies listed above and other similar technologies.

	Mobile Devices
You may be visiting our Sites from your mobile device. Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and We or our third-party service providers may receive such information if you access the Sites through mobile devices. Some features of the Sites may allow for the collection of mobile phone numbers and We may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. Furthermore, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, We or our third-party service providers may receive this information.

	How is the Personal Information used?
We will use the Personal Information you provide to Us, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping and/or share it with our affiliates for internal marketing purposes. In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that We think might interest you.
You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section below.
We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.

	Do we share Personal Information and Website Usage information with others?

	Third-Party Offers
We may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other entities including our affiliates who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you. Unless you elect not to receive such offers by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section below, we may from time to time provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you these offers. If you change your mind and no longer want us to share your Personal Information with these types of third parties, follow the instructions to opt out in the Right to Opt Out section below.

	Service Providers
We may use third-party partners to help operate our Website and deliver our products and services, and may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or services for or through this Website or for our business (such as Website or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).

	Aggregate Statistics
We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and e-mails to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.

	Legally Compelled Disclosures
We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose user information when We have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Website, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Additionally, we cooperate with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property rights and other rights.

	Public and Interactive Areas; Guidelines
We may from time to time provide interactive services on our Sites, including, without limitation, blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards and discussion groups. We are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service We provide on our Sites, and we expressly exclude all liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user, whether the service is moderated or not. We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy or reliability of any content, including product reviews on our Ratings &amp; Reviews features or any other data, information, materials, writings, images, photographs, audio recordings, and video recordings (collectively &quot;User Materials&quot;). Similarly, We may or may not exercise editorial control over the User Materials of any such interactive services. As a result, you may be exposed to User Material that is inaccurate, fraudulent or deceptive or that you find offensive or objectionable. However, We reserve the right, but are not obliged, to monitor our interactive services and to pre-screen, remove or alter any User Materials in our sole discretion. We may restrict, suspend or terminate your use of these services or the Sites where We believe that there has been a misuse. Your use of such interactive services are at your own risk. Personal Information that you post on or through the public areas of any Site is generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by, others and may result in unsolicited messages or other contact from others. You should not provide Personal Information about yourself in public or interactive areas of any Site. Such Personal Information is not covered under this Privacy Policy.

	Security
While MAKE UP FOR EVER will take reasonable precautions to protect the security and integrity of Personal Information, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, We cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.
We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.
Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk.
If you contact Us by e-mail or a &quot;contact us&quot; or similar feature on our Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.
If you choose to become a registered user, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Sites by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify MAKE UP FOR EVER of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify MAKE UP FOR EVER when you desire to cancel your account. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.
We will not be liable for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
We recommend that you change your password every three months. If you are using a public computer (e.g. at a library), or a shared computer, We urge you to log out of your account and our Sites altogether, and quit the browser application before you leave the computer. This will help prevent others from accessing your account and any personal information.
In the unlikely event that We believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, We may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, We would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, We may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.

	Consent to Processing
By providing Personal Information to Us, you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories.

	Right to Opt Out
You may have the right to &quot;opt out&quot; of certain of our uses of your Personal Information. If you would like to opt out of receiving promotional emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of each email. If you would like to opt out of receiving direct mail or telephone marketing calls from Us, or if you prefer that We not share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes, please send your request, including your name, email, street address, city, state, and zip code, via email to info@makeupforeverusa.com (please use the subject line: Privacy Opt-Out Request).
We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent improperly, or do not have complete information. We will process your request within 30 days of the date we receive your request, but you may, in the meantime, receive previously scheduled emails, mail or calls from us. We will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such date following your request. In these cases, please contact that entity directly. Once you have opted out, you do not need to do so again. Please note that MAKE UP FOR EVER may still use your Personal Information (and may share your information with our service providers) to provide you with services, including sending you administrative and transaction-related emails, relating to your online shopping needs and your other activity on MAKE UP FOR EVER's Sites.

<h3>

"Personal Information" includes, for example, your name; home and/or business address; e-mail address; telephone number; credit card and other payment information; and demographic information and/or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.</p>

<p>Sign up for e-mail or catalogs: In order to receive our e-mail blasts, including information about new products, events, tips and more, you need to share your e-mail address and name. You do not have to sign up for e-mail to browse the Website.

	Clear GIFs</h3>
<p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our communications with you to enable Us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail that communicates to Us whether you viewed an email that we sent you or visited a certain page on our Website. A clear GIF may enable Us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>
<h3>
	IP Address and Clickstream Data</h3>
<p>Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit Us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet.

Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider.</p>
<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Website usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers.</p>
<h3>
	Third Party Ad Servers.</h3>
<p>We may use the services of one or more third party advertising companies. If We do, these third party advertising companies may also collect information from your activities on the Website as well as other sites for the purpose of providing advertisements and other content that is customized to your interests and preferences. This means that our ads may appear on participating web sites based upon your browsing activity. To allow us to offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we may use and allow our third party advertising companies to use the technologies listed above and other similar technologies.</p>
<h3>
	Mobile Devices</h3>
<p>You may be visiting our Sites from your mobile device. Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and We or our third-party service providers may receive such information if you access the Sites through mobile devices. Some features of the Sites may allow for the collection of mobile phone numbers and We may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. Furthermore, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, We or our third-party service providers may receive this information.</p>
<h3>
	How is the Personal Information used?</h3>
<p>We will use the Personal Information you provide to Us, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping and/or share it with our affiliates for internal marketing purposes. In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that We think might interest you.</p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section below.</p>

Unless you elect not to receive such offers by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section below, we may from time to time provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you these offers.

<h3>
	Aggregate Statistics</h3>
<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and e-mails to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.</p>

<h2>
	Public and Interactive Areas; Guidelines</h2>
<p>We may from time to time provide interactive services on our Sites, including, without limitation, blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards and discussion groups. We are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service We provide on our Sites, and we expressly exclude all liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user, whether the service is moderated or not. We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy or reliability of any content, including product reviews on our Ratings &amp; Reviews features or any other data, information, materials, writings, images, photographs, audio recordings, and video recordings (collectively "User Materials"). Similarly, We may or may not exercise editorial control over the User Materials of any such interactive services. As a result, you may be exposed to User Material that is inaccurate, fraudulent or deceptive or that you find offensive or objectionable. However, We reserve the right, but are not obliged, to monitor our interactive services and to pre-screen, remove or alter any User Materials in our sole discretion. We may restrict, suspend or terminate your use of these services or the Sites where We believe that there has been a misuse. Your use of such interactive services are at your own risk. Personal Information that you post on or through the public areas of any Site is generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by, others and may result in unsolicited messages or other contact from others. You should not provide Personal Information about yourself in public or interactive areas of any Site. Such Personal Information is not covered under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>
	Security</h2>
<p>While MAKE UP FOR EVER will take reasonable precautions to protect the security and integrity of Personal Information, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, We cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.</p>
<p>We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk.</p>
<p>If you contact Us by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on our Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.</p>
<p>If you choose to become a registered user, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Sites by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify MAKE UP FOR EVER of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify MAKE UP FOR EVER when you desire to cancel your account. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.</p>
<p>We will not be liable for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>
<p>We recommend that you change your password every three months. If you are using a public computer (e.g. at a library), or a shared computer, We urge you to log out of your account and our Sites altogether, and quit the browser application before you leave the computer. This will help prevent others from accessing your account and any personal information.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that We believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, We may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, We would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, We may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.</p>
<h2>
	Consent to Processing</h2>
<p>By providing Personal Information to Us, you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories.</p>
<h2>
	Right to Opt Out</h2>
<p>You may have the right to "opt out" of certain of our uses of your Personal Information. If you would like to opt out of receiving promotional emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of each email. If you would like to opt out of receiving direct mail or telephone marketing calls from Us, or if you prefer that We not share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes, please send your request, including your name, email, street address, city, state, and zip code, via email to info@makeupforeverusa.com (please use the subject line: Privacy Opt-Out Request).</p>
<p>We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent improperly, or do not have complete information. We will process your request within 30 days of the date we receive your request, but you may, in the meantime, receive previously scheduled emails, mail or calls from us. We will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such date following your request. In these cases, please contact that entity directly. Once you have opted out, you do not need to do so again. Please note that MAKE UP FOR EVER may still use your Personal Information (and may share your information with our service providers) to provide you with services, including sending you administrative and transaction-related emails, relating to your online shopping needs and your other activity on MAKE UP FOR EVER's Sites.</p>
