operating system and type of browser software being used and the 
activities conducted by the user while on the Website. An IP address is a
 number that lets computers attached to the internet, such as our web 
servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of 
the Website the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it 
helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click 
on most, the way visitors are clicking through the Website, how many 
visitors are surfing to various pages on the Website, how long visitors 
to the Website are staying and how often they are visiting. It also 
helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better 
administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any 
visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a 
visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the approximate 
geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
