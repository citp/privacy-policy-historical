**Organization: Automated Software Inc.**

Automated Software Inc. believes that privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of Internet commerce. Our status as an Internet merchant account holder and certified payment gateway holder requires us to have a stringent policy regarding all of the information that we collect. 

Your use of this site or Automated Software Inc.’s services constitutes acceptance of these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these policies, please cease using this site immediately. 

These terms were last revised on August 29, 2010. Automated Software Inc. reserves the right to amend these policies from time to time. If such amendments affect how Automated Software Inc. uses or discloses personal information already held by Automated Software Inc. in a material and adverse way over and above previous express or implied consent, Automated Software Inc. will contact you to obtain consent. Notwithstanding the terms of this policy, the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information may be made outside of the terms herein to the extent provided for in the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and other relevant Canadian and Ontario legislation in effect from time to time. These exemptions include, without limitation, publicly available information, or information disclosed for criminal or civil investigations or compliance with law or court orders. 

Automated Software Inc. takes reasonable precautions to ensure your privacy on the terms contained in this policy. Automated Software Inc. uses reasonable efforts to, but cannot totally prevent, unintended disclosures by such means as hackers and other unauthorized individuals, and inadvertent or illicit employee actions. 

**Cardholder provided Information:  
**Our electronic purchase service requires that cardholders provide contact information (including without limitation: name, address, city, state or province, postal code, country, telephone and email), and financial information (including without limitation: name on credit card, credit card number and expiry date), and ordering information. This information is collected and used to process the transaction and for internal accounting and other procedures. Following a transaction, we may contact cardholders by phone or email for security purposes. 

**Information Automatically Collected:  
**Our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. The IP addresses we collect on our electronic purchase service are linked to personally identifiable information. This is collected in order to combat fraud during the purchase process. We also use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. Automatically collected information is also used for the same purposes as cardholder supplied and merchant supplied information. 

**Sharing of Information:  
**Certain information submitted through the electronic purchase service (excluding credit card numbers) is shared with the merchant from whom the cardholder is purchasing the products / services so the merchant can fulfill the order. Information is also shared with other parties necessary to complete credit card transactions, including, without limitation, companies related to Automated Software Inc., credit card companies, credit card clearing houses and processors, and financial institutions. 

Automated Software Inc. is acting as an intermediary between the merchant and a user’s credit card company. The parties mentioned in the above paragraph, and not Automated Software Inc., are responsible for their own privacy polices and for maintaining privacy and confidentiality for all information Automated Software Inc. provides them. If a user has any questions or concerns about the privacy policies of those parties, it must contact such parties. 

Except for the above parties, and for use by Automated Software Inc.’s consultants and professional advisers on Automated Software Inc.’s behalf for the uses disclosed herein, Automated Software Inc. does not share personal information with any other third parties. Automated Software Inc. may, however, provide to third parties aggregate or statistical information that does not disclose personally identifiable information. Automated Software Inc. may disclose personal information to another entity purchasing (including for diligence purposes prior to purchase) the assets of Automated Software Inc., providing that entity abides by this or a similar privacy policy. 

**Contact Us / Email Inquiries:  
**No information sent to Automated Software Inc. via email or the website inquiry form is used for any other reason than to respond to and maintain a record of the inquiry. This information is not sent to third parties or retained for mailing list purposes. 

**Security:  
**Automated Software Inc. takes measures to protect and keep information secure. Our Merchants’ area, application form and electronic purchase service are secured with SSL encryption. Verisign has supplied us with digital certificates for our Web sites. All information collected by Automated Software Inc. is held offline, secured via SSL encryption, and protected by a firewall. Whenever sensitive information is transmitted to Automated Software Inc. through our Web site, such as a credit card number, our server provides 128-bit encryption of the information as it travels across the Internet. Automated Software Inc. restricts internal access to personal information to selected members of Automated Software Inc.’s staff. 

**Third Party Dispute Resolution:  
**Automated Software Inc. is committed to resolving disputes quickly and efficiently. In the event that a dispute cannot be settled through our normal internal processes, Automated Software Inc. Inc. is committed to using an in-house dispute resolution process.   
This process can be initiated through [webmaster@makeavoice.com](mailto:webmaster@makeavoice.com) only after our normal internal processes have been completed.   
In no circumstance may any customer of Automated Software Inc.' chargeback or dispute claims via any payment method. Any customer with a dispute from a Third Party Resolution area will have all services suspended and be denied service, unless reversed and verified by Automated Software Inc.' Staff.   
Use our ticket system, live support contacts, or email us if you have any request for partial or full refund. 

In the event the issue relates to private information, Automated Software Inc. will not use or distribute any private information without express permission. All disputes in arbitration will be resolved under the laws of Ontario.
