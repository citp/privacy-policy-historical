In those cases, we share some of your Personal Information as well as your non-personal activity information with makhsoom Merchants.

There may be factors beyond our control that may result in unintentional disclosure of your Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
