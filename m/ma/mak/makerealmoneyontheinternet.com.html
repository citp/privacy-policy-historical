                        you elect to participate and the services provided. For 
                        example, you may be asked to provide information when 
                        you register for access to certain portions of our site 
                        or request certain features, such as newsletters or when

                        you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards 
                        and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.

                        collects information automatically and through the use 
                        of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. 
                        For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service 
                        Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and 
                        hold information from your visit. Among other things, 
                        the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing 
                        you from having to re-enter that information each time 
                        you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter 
                        a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As 
                        we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information 
                        through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 
                        not to provide us with information, for example by setting 
                        your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do 
                        you may be unable to access certain portions of the site 
                        or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,
