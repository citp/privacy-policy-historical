_Last revision: November 2, 2007_

  MakeFive is a website that allows users to post and discuss opinions with others. You do not need to be registered to search or view site content; however, you must register in order to post, comment and contact Members.

• You can choose the level of access that others have to your profile, including access to your full  
   profile, friends list, personal photos and notes; however, all Members, regardless of profile  
   settings automatically have a public profile created, which displays User Name, Profile Image  
   (if provided), Lists and Selections, and the URL to your Public Profile. This allows others to  
   see who is commenting on lists and items. Any comments and content that you post to lists,  
   comment areas, and other profiles may be viewable to any site user. We will not display your  
   email address to other site users without your consent.

  • You post Content on the site at your own risk. Although you can choose the level of access that  
   others have to your profile, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot  
   control the actions of other users; therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that content you  
   post on the site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Any improper collection or  
   misuse of information provided on MakeFive should be reported to [privacy@makefive.com](mailto:privacy@makefive.com)

  • We may record information about your usage, such as when you use MakeFive, the Lists you

   post to the website.

  • Advertisements shown to you may be related to the information and content associated with  
   your profile, such as notes, lists, or the search term you entered. Advertisements that appear  
   on MakeFive are sometimes delivered directly to users by third party advertisers who  
   automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also download cookies to  
   your computer to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising  
   content. MakeFive does not have access to, or control of, the cookies that may be placed by  
   third party advertisers.

   from contacting you again.

   notes regarding service.
