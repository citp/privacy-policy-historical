**Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites**

Make4fun allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within Make4fun.

Make4fun does not provide any User's personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks.

Please note that if an advertiser asks Make4fun to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of Make4fun, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. Make4fun's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
