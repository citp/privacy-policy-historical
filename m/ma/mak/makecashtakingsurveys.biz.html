		        <p align="left">MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of   Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.</p>
		        <p align="left"><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>
		        <p align="left">How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,   the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For   example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to   certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or   when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in   sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive   areas of our site. Like most Web sites, MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz also collects   information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be   transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet   Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information   from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and   password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you   visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular   advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may   also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose   not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to   refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain   portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,   and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your   preferences.</p>
		        <p align="left"><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
		        <p align="left">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and   deliver more individualized content and advertising. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,   street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.   We may sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide the personal information that you supply to us to any third party, for telemarketing or email marketing purposes, and we may work with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our users.</p>
		        <p align="left">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)   may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your   usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help   enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or   what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be   shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does   not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to   identify you individually.</p>
		        <p align="left">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on   MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz to communicate with you about your registration and   customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and   products offered by MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz and other topics we think you might   find of interest. </p>
		        <p align="left">Personally Identifiable Information collected by MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz may   also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site   administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,   administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.   Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our   site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will   use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as   we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with   other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be   among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response   to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to   do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,   and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or   necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in   such cases.</p>
		        <p align="left"><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
		        <p align="left">MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to   respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,   including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers   accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection   policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link   to, or view as part of a frame on a MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz page, certain content   that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through   MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz you may be introduced to, or be able to access,   information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other   parties. MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz is not responsible for the actions or policies   of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those   third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a   third party.</p>
		        <p align="left">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third   parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your   preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our   advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the   advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.   Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third   parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.   MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz does not control the use of this technology by third   parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or   policies of such third parties.</p>
		        <p align="left">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally   Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information   can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without   our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or   third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz   and this policy.</p>
		        <p align="left"><strong>Children</strong></p>
		        <p align="left">MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally   Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by   law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in   violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.

		        <p align="left">MakeCashTakingSurveys.biz reserves the right to change this policy at any time.   Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site   following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those   changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be   used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information   was collected.</p>
		        <p align="left"><strong>Governing law</strong></p>
