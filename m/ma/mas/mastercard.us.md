We, our service providers and partners collect certain information by using automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, when you interact with our advertisements, mobile applications, or visit our websites, pages or other digital assets. The information we collect in this manner may include: IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs and information on actions taken or interaction with our digital assets.

We, our service providers and our partners may also collect information about your activities on our websites and apps for use in providing you with content and advertising tailored to your individual interests. The information collected for these purposes may include details about things like the particular pages or advertisements you view on our websites and the actions you take on our websites and apps.

### Personal Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described in this Global Privacy Notice or as we disclose to you at the time the data is collected.

We may share personal information we collect with our affiliates, financial institutions and other entities that issue payment cards or process payment transactions and merchants. We share personal information to process payment transactions and perform other activities that you request. We also may share personal information with entities that assist with payment card fraud prevention, to protect payment transactions against fraud, and to ensure the security of the transaction and our payment processing system. For example, in this context we provide card issuers with information about their cardholders’ transactions that MasterCard processes.

In addition, we may share personal information with other third parties with your consent. When MasterCard acts as a service provider for third parties we may provide them with personal information we collected on their behalf.

We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf. We authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information only as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We require these service providers by contract to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information they process on our behalf.

MasterCard transfers personal information within the MasterCard group of affiliated companies subject to the terms of this Global Privacy Notice or otherwise as we disclose to you at the time the data is collected (e.g. via program specific privacy notice).

On our websites, you may choose to use certain features that can be accessed through, or for which we partner with, other entities that are not otherwise affiliated with MasterCard. These features, which include social networking and geo-location tools, are operated by third parties, including social networks, and are clearly identified as such. These third parties may use or share personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We strongly suggest you review the third parties’ privacy policies if you use the relevant features.

We may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent harm or financial loss, or (iii) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Global Privacy Notice. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

You have certain rights regarding the personal information we maintain about you.  We also offer you certain choices about what personal information we collect from you, how we use that information, and how we communicate with you.

You can choose not to provide personal information to MasterCard by refraining from conducting payment transactions. You also may refrain from submitting information directly to us. However, if you do not provide personal information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from the full range of MasterCard products and services, and we may not be able to provide you with information about products, services and promotions.

You can opt out of the collection and use of certain information, which we collect about you by automated means, when you visit our websites.

You can opt out of certain uses of information, which we collect about you by automated means, when you visit third-party websites and interact with our ads. We may use service providers to serve ads on those third-party websites. These ads may be customized and served based on the use of data we (and our partners) have collected on our websites and apps. In addition, some of our service providers and partners may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites to customize and serve these ads.

To the extent provided by applicable law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us, or object at any time on legitimate grounds, to the processing of your personal information. We will apply your preferences going forward. In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to MasterCard’s use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you cannot take advantage of certain MasterCard products or services.

If we fall short of your expectations in processing your personal information or you wish to make a complaint about our privacy practices, please tell us because it gives us an opportunity to fix the problem. You may contact us by using the contact details provided in the “How To Contact Us” section below. To assist us in responding to your request, please give full details of the issue. We attempt to review and respond to all complaints within a reasonable time.

If you provide us with any information or material relating to another individual, you should make sure that the sharing with us and our further use as described to you from time to time is in line with applicable laws, so for example you should duly inform that individual on the processing of her/his personal data and obtain her/his consent, as may be necessary under applicable laws.  


### International Data Transfers

We may transfer personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice.  
MasterCard is a global business. To offer our services, we may need to transfer your personal information among several countries, including the United States, where we are headquartered. We comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate safeguards for the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area or Switzerland.  


### How We Hold And Protect Personal Information

The security of your personal information is important to MasterCard. We are committed to protecting the information we collect. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide or we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We use SSL encryption on a number of our websites from which we transfer certain personal information.

MasterCard stores personal information only for as long as it is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which the personal information was collected, unless otherwise required or authorized by applicable law. We take measures to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if required by law or if the personal information is no longer required for the purpose for which we collected it.  


### Links To Other Websites

Our websites may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites may operate independently from MasterCard. Linked websites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. To the extent any linked websites you visit are not owned or controlled by MasterCard, we are not responsible for the websites’ content, any use of the websites, or the privacy practices of the websites.  


### Updates To Our Global Privacy Notice
