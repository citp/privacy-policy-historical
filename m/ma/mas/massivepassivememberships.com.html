b. Use of Cookies<br>
<br>
MassivePassiveMemberships.com may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user
experience.&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file that is placed on
your
hard disk by a Web page server.&nbsp; Cookies cannot be used to run
programs or deliver viruses to your computer.&nbsp; Cookies are
uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the
domain that issued the cookie to you. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
feature to save you time.&nbsp; For example, if you personalize a
web
page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your
specific information on subsequent visits.&nbsp; Hence, this
simplifies
the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by
providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as
providing personalized functionality.. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
MassivePassiveMemberships.com reserves the right to share aggregated site
statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies
to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding
customer value (such as merging into MassivePassiveMemberships.com.com a site
that relies on third-party cookies).<br>
<br>
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.&nbsp; Most Web
browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing
your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the
functionality on our Website.<br>

purchased.&nbsp; If you purchase by credit card, this information
may
be forwarded to your credit card provider. For other types of
registrations, we will ask for the relevant information. You may also
be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide
assistance and information to you. For example, such data may be
warranted in order to provide online technical support and

4. USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES<br>
[Insert Name of Company/Web Address] Web pages may contain electronic
images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel
gifs –
that allow MassivePassiveMemberships.com to count users who have visited those
pages and to deliver co-branded services.&nbsp; MassivePassiveMemberships.com
may
include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in
order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.<br>
<br>
Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service
providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising
campaigns or email communications.&nbsp; These Web beacons may be
used
by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your
computer.&nbsp; This allows the service provider to recognize your
computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile
anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn
enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and
emails bring you to our website and how you use the site.&nbsp;

collect or
access your personal information.<br>
