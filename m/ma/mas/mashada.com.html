					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					Thank 
                                you for visiting Mashada.com site. Your privacy is important 
                                to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice 
                                explaining our online information practices and the choices 
                                you can make about the way your information is collected and 
                                used at this Mashada.com site.
<p style="font-weight: bold">The Information We Collect </p>
<p>At 
	some Mashada.com sites, you can enter contests, vote in 
	polls or otherwise express an opinion, or subscribe to one 
	of our services. The types of personally identifiable information 
	that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, 
	e-mail address, telephone number, fax number and information 
	about your interests in and use of various products, programs, 
	and services.</p>
<p>At 
	certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide 
	us with the requested personally identifiable information 
	will be able to order products, programs, and services or 
	otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.</p>
<p>We 
	also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information 
	when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser 
	you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari), the type 
	of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows  or Mac 
	OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider 
	(e.g., America Online, Africa Online, Earthlink).</p>
<p><strong>How 
	We Use the Information</strong></p>
<p>We 
	may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill 
	your requests for our products, programs, and services, to 
	respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer 
	you other products, programs or services that we believe may 
	be of interest to you.</p>
<p>We 
	sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such 
	as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or 
	when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill 
	a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you 
	about your account with us.</p>
<p>We 
	use the information that you provide about others to enable 
	us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we 
	also may use this information to offer our products, programs, 
	or services to them.</p>
<p>The 
	information we collect in connection with our online forums 
	and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. 
	We use this information to facilitate participation in these 
	online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer 
	you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>If 
	you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter 
	to our editors"), we may publish your screen name and 
	other information you have provided to us.</p>
<p>We 
	sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information 
	that we collect to improve the design and content of our site 
	and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. 
	We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze 
	site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or 
	services.</p>
<p>We 
	will disclose information we maintain when required to do 
	so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a 
	subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response 
	to a law enforcement agency's request.</p>
<p>Agents 
	and contractors of Mashada.com who have access to personally 
	identifiable information are required to protect this information 
	in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, 
	for example, not using the information for any purpose other 
	than to carry out the services they are performing for Mashada.com.</p>
<p>Although 
	we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized 
	disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally 
	identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed 
	in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. 
	Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third 
	parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for 
	access to personally identifiable information about themselves 
	for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the 
	data.</p>
<p>If a Mashada.com 
	site discloses personally identifiable information to companies 
	not owned by Mashada.com who want to market products or services 
	to you, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out 
	or block such uses. For instructions on how to opt out from 
	such disclosures, please <a href="mailto:privacy@mashada.com">privacy@mashada.com</a> or  go to: <a href="http://www.mashada.com/contact.php" target="_blank">http://www.mashada.com/contact.php</a>.</p>
<p>Mashada.com 
	may on occasion combine information we receive online with 
	outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those 
	products or services that may be of interest to you. If you 
	prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, <a href="mailto:privacy@mashada.com">privacy@mashada.com</a> or  go to: <a href="/contact">http://www.mashada.com/contact</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, 
	Mashada.com sites will not use or transfer personally 
	identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated 
	to the ones described above without also providing you with 
	an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.</p>
<p><strong>Collection 
	of Information by Third-Party Sites, Advertisers and Sponsors</strong></p>
<p>Some 
	of our sites contain links to other sites whose information 
	practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult 
	the other sites' privacy notices, as we have no control over 
	information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third 
	parties.</p>
<p>Mashada.com sites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or 
	promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified 
	third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third 
	parties may obtain personally identifiable information that 
	visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, 
	sweepstakes, or promotion. Mashada.com has no control 
	over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. The 
	Mashada.com site will notify you at the time of requesting 
	personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors 
	will obtain such information.</p>

	serve the advertisements that you may see at its web pages

	policy does not cover any use of information that such third 
	parties may have collected from you or the methods used by 
	the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, 
	web beacons and clear gifs). For more information on this 
	site's use of such third-parties, please <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

	with personally identifiable information, this information 
	may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</p>

	in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping 
	carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, 
	programs, or services.</p>
<p>We 
	may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons"

	policy.</p>
