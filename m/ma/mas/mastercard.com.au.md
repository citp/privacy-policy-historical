Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described herein or otherwise disclose to you at the time the data is collected.

We share information to perform payment card transactions and other activities that you request. We may share the personal information we collect with our affiliates, financial institutions that issue payment cards or process payment card transactions, entities that assist with payment card fraud prevention, and merchants. For example, in this context we provide financial institutions with information about their cardholders' transactions that MasterCard processes. In addition, we may share personal information with other third parties with the consent of the individual to whom the information pertains. 

We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf. We do not authorise these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform certain services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We require these service providers by contract to appropriately safeguard the privacy and security of personal information they process on our behalf.

On our websites, you may choose to use certain features for which we partner with other entities. These features, which include social networking and geographic location tools, are operated by third parties that are not affiliated with MasterCard. These third parties may use personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. On sites on which these features are offered, the relevant third parties are identified on the websites. We strongly suggest you review the third parties' privacy policies if you use the relevant features.

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Global Privacy Policy. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.
