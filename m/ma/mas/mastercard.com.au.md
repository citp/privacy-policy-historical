We share information to process electronic transactions and other activities that you request.

For example, in this context we provide financial institutions with information about their cardholders' transactions that MasterCard processes. In addition, we may share personal information with other third parties with the consent of the individual to whom the information pertains or as otherwise directed by your financial institution. 

We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf.

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Global Privacy Notice.
