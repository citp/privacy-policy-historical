<p>Depending on the portion of our site that you have subscribed to or interacted with, we may use your information in a number of ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>The email address you provided through our newsletter subscription form enables us to send you a daily digest of Mashable news stories. This subscription is entirely opt-in by the user. (We cannot subscribe you to the newsletter as you personally must have access to the email account in order to verify the subscription.) Subscribers can opt-out of our newsletter at any time by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link that is present on every email at the very bottom of the newsletter.</li>
<li>The email address that you use when contacting us with an editorial tip or via our Contact Form will not be used for any reason but for the purposes of responding to your inquiry.</li>
<li>The email address associated with your account when you comment on our stories may be used in conjunction with contests and promotions hosted on Mashable's website to notify you if you have won. Email addresses provided in comments are not usually used for any other reason except that they may be used as a customer service and policy violation contact mechanism</li>
