To help you make decisions about the information you provide anywhere on this site, this notice has been provided to outline my practices.  You should know that we respect your privacy, and that we will never sell your email address to anyone. Also, we hate spam as much as you do, so you will only ever get email from us that we  have personally approved for distribution to the list.

We use secure hosting accounts and other security measures to protect our database and any information provided.

Any e-mail you receive from this site will contain the option to unsubscribe at the end of the e-mail. You can unsubscribe at any time.

If and when we offer products on this site, when you order a product, the information you provide will only be provided to outside parties if it is necessary to complete and deliver the order. Your information will never be shared or disclosed to other parties for any other reason.

Non-identifying information may be used to improve the site or shared with advertisers. For instance, information that is collected regarding traffic to the site or specific pages may be shared, but this will never include any identifying information.

We hope you have a great day.
