In basic terms, we will collect as much information about your use of our website as we possibly can. In our experience, this is the best way of improving the experience of visitors to the website. Oh, and just because other websites don’t tell you that they do this, doesn’t mean that they don’t!

As part of our participation in Google’s Certified Shops Programme, certain information relating to transactions undertaken on our website will be collected and processed. We provide transaction information to Google to demonstrate that we deliver orders on time, have low occurrence of customer issues, and resolve customer issues quickly.

We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. Sensitive information includes information relating to your health and religion. We will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure that any information which we do hold will be accurate and up to date. 

You can make a formal “data subject access request” under the Data Protection Act 1998 to access the information we hold about you. Any data subject access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs. However, we want to make it as easy as possible for you to find out what information we hold about you, so you can check the information that we hold by simply sending us an email. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct them promptly.

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. We won’t transfer your information outside the European Economic Area without your consent.
