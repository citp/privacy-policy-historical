							<p><strong>Massage Envy Franchising, LLC Web Site Privacy
Statement</strong></p>

<p>This document was last updated on November 18, 2010.</p>

<p>Massage Envy Franchising, LLC ("Massage Envy," "us," "our," or
"we") strives to offer the visitors of our web sites including
MassageEnvy.com and MassageEnvyCareers.com (the "Site") the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. In order to do this, we may, at times, use
"Personally Identifiable Information" (any information that can be
used to identify a specific individual, such as a name, postal
address, telephone number or email address) subject to the terms of
this privacy policy statement ("Policy"). Please note that this
Policy applies only to information collected by Massage Envy online
and does not impact information collected or used by Massage Envy,
its subsidiaries, or its affiliates through other means. By using
this Site, you signify your acceptance of this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>1. Information Collection</strong></p>

<p>What We Collect</p>

<p>When you browse through our site we collect:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic information about your computer, browser and connection
to make sure that we can give you proper information and customer
service and for security purposes.</li>

<li>Aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit
to improve our site.</li>

<li>Number of links you click within the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose to contact us through the Web site, buy gift
cards, request an appointment, or request to be notified of job
openings near you we may ask you for more information
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name and address which, among other things, enables us to
process your payment;</li>

<li>Your email address and telephone number so we can contact
you;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose to buy a gift card we will ask you for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Credit card information to complete your transaction and to
verify your identity.</li>

<li>Recipient name and e-mail address to send the link to the
activated gift card.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding your personal information or
wish to correct or change any of your personal information, please
contact info@massageenvy.com.</p>

<p>Choosing Options:</p>

<p>You can choose to stop receiving solicitations at any time
simply by replying to an email's Unsubscribe function, or
contacting Customer Service. Please refer to the Choice and opt-out
section for more information.</p>

<p>Supplementing Information:</p>

<p>We may obtain information from or about you in other ways. For
example, we may verify user information with a service provider, or
users may send us information during their contacts with Customer
Support.</p>

<p><strong>2. User Information</strong></p>

<p>We store information that we collect through cookies and log
files to create a profile of our users. We do not link the
information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
information you submit while on our site.</p>

<p>Cookies:</p>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied
to information about the user. We do not link the information
stored in cookies to any personally identifiable information you
submit while on our site. We use both session cookies and
persistent cookies. For the session cookie, once users close the
browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a
small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended
period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target
the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.
By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a
password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If
users reject the cookie, they may still browse our site, however
they will not be able to buy gift cards or use other interactive
functionality that requires cookies. Persistent cookies can be
removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>

<p>Log Files:</p>

<p>Like most standard website servers, we use log files for error
diagnostics, session management, and determining our advertising
efficiency. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
type, internet service provider (ISP), referring pages, platform
type, date/time stamp. IP addresses, etc. are linked to personally
identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>3. Communications from the Site</strong></p>

<p>Transactions and Service Announcements:</p>

<p>Users who buy will receive a number of emails throughout the
transaction process and they may sometimes receive phone calls from
our Customer Service department to ensure smooth transactions. We
may also occasionally send out service-related announcements, for
instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance.
Generally, these communications are not promotional in nature, and
users will receive them as long as their accounts are open.</p>

<p>Special Offers, Newsletters and Updates:</p>

<p>Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the
option to not receive these types of communications, as explained
in the Choice and opt-out section below.</p>

<p>Customer Service:</p>

<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide
requested services. We respond to issues relating to a user's
account via email or phone, in accordance with the user's
wishes.</p>

<p>Choice and opt-out:</p>

<p>A user can change their opt-in or opt-out status in several
ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>From a Newsletter: Click on the "Unsubscribe" link within the
email.</li>

<li>You may additionally unsubscribe by sending your request to
Privacy@MassageEnvy.com</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Sharing Information</strong></p>

<p>At Massage Envy, we care about your privacy. We will not share
your credit card number or any other financial information with any
third party except for the verification purposes mentioned above.
We may share your personal information with third parties in the
following instances:</p>

<p>Within Our Corporate Family:</p>

<p>We may share information with our parent company, subsidiaries,
joint ventures or other companies under common control, where it
may be used to provide joint services or for purposes such as
internal statistics, strategic decision-making, customer
verification, fraud prevention and security.</p>

<p>Legal Disclaimer:</p>

<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may
disclose personal information when required by law or under the
good-faith belief that such action is necessary under applicable
law. We may disclose personal information in order to establish or
exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We also
share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, to protect our
property or interests or that of our agents and employees, and to
protect personal safety or the public.</p>

<p>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable):</p>

<p>We share some aggregated demographic information (age, zip
codes) with some of our partners. This is not linked to any
personally identifiable information. We may use third-party
advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies
may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs
or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any
information that these third parties collect via cookies and action
tags is completely anonymous.</p>

<p>Third Party Service Providers:</p>

<p>We may disclose information about individual users to third
parties who provide services to Massage Envy. These third parties
provide a variety of services to Massage Envy, including, without
limitation, verifying credit card information, tracking Internet
marketing campaigns, and processing credit card transactions. In
addition, these services may include enhancing the information
Massage Envy collects about its customers. We may also use
third-party email providers to assist with sending our marketing
emails. These companies do not retain, share, store or use
personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Any
personally identifiable information that Massage Envy shares with
its service providers may only be used to provide services to
Massage Envy and the service providers will not be given permission
to use such information for other purposes.</p>

<p>Business Transitions:</p>

<p>In the event Massage Envy goes through a business transition,
such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of
all or a portion of its assets, users' personal information will,
in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be
notified via prominent notice on our website for 30 days after a
change of ownership or control of their personal information, if
personal information will be used contrary to this policy. If as a
result of the business transition, the users' personally
identifiable information will be used in a manner different from
that stated at the time of collection, users will be given the
option to continue sharing their information consistent with our
notification of changes section. However, nothing in this Privacy
Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Massage Envy to
transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the
Site), for any purposes, without any limitation whatsoever. Massage
Envy specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of
personally identifiable information collected from its Site to the
buyer of that portion of its business relating to that
information.</p>

<p><strong>5. Security</strong></p>

<p>This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our
users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the
website, their information is protected both online and
off-line.</p>

<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive
information (such as credit card number), that information is
encrypted and is protected with encryption software, currently SSL
encryption. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the
lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. While we use SSL
encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect
user-information off-line. Access to all users' information, not
just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to
our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a
specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service
representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
information. Employees are kept up-to-date on our security and
privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable
information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage at a
professional hosting company. Although we endeavor to create secure
and reliable Sites and to safeguard against unauthorized
disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally
identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in
a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You hereby
acknowledge that Massage Envy is not responsible for any
intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby
release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the
use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.</p>

<p><strong>6. External Links</strong></p>

<p>The Site contains links to other websites maintained by third
parties. Please be aware that Massage Envy exercises no control
over linked sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices
or the content of such sites. Each linked site maintains its own
independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures,
and you are encouraged to view the privacy policies of these other
sites before providing any personal information.</p>

<p><strong>7. Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong></p>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those
changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places
we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we
disclose it.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any
time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes
to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a
notice on our home page. Users with questions or concerns regarding
their privacy or this statement should contact Privacy Statement
Personnel via Postal Mail at: 14350 N 87th St, Ste 200, Scottsdale,
AZ 85260, or by e-mail at Privacy@MassageEnvy.com.</p>
