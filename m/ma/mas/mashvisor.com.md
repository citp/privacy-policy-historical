# Privacy Policy | Mashvisor

**YOUR PRIVACY IS NOT FOR SALE**

We do not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. Mashvisor uses and discloses your personal information only as follows:

  * unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new service offerings, or changes to this privacy policy;
  * to analyze site usage and improve the Service;
  * to deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Service;
  * to fulfill your requests for certain services and transactions;
  * for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;
  * to enforce Mashvisor’s Terms of Use; and
  * as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.



In the event that you access the Service as brought to you by our partners or service providers, through a co-branded URL or by web services, your email address used for registration on the Service may be provided to that partner or service provider to fulfill your request.

HOW WE LIMIT THE COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Certain areas and features of [Mashvisor.com](http://mashvisor.com/) are available to you without registration or the need to provide to us any information. However, other features of the Site or the Service may require registration, which involves provision to Mashvisor of an email address, a password and additional details for fulfilling your service requests and to participate on our third party sites, a username (collectively the “Registration or Sign Up Information”). In order to benefit from the full functionality of the Service, you may also be asked to provide additional information to all Mashvisor to share more data for your use.

From time to time we may request other personal information to provide you with other benefits of the Service such as application for a loan or payment instructions for purchasing a property. In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used only for the stated purpose. By providing the information, you are also agreeing to share the information with other Service providers such as Property Provider, lender, insurance company, Title company, Escrow/ Closing Attorney, inspection company, appraisal company and others.

Mashvisor may make anonymous or aggregate personal information and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner to:

  * Advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes, such as the number of users who applied for a loan or how many users clicked on a particular Offer from Mashvisor;
  * Organizations approved by Mashvisor that conduct research into investment purchases; and
  * Users of the Service for purposes of comparison of their personal financial situation relative to the broader market.



Such information does not identify you individually. Access to your Registration Information, other Credentials, and any other personal information you provide is strictly restricted and used in accordance with specific internal procedures and safeguard governing access, in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. These individuals have been selected in accordance with our security policies and practices and are bound by confidentiality obligations. We may also use third party vendors or service providers to help us provide the Service to you, such as sending e-mail messages on our behalf or hosting and operating a particular feature or functionality of the Service or a lender processing your loan application. Our contracts with these third parties outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit them from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service they’re providing. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.

HOW YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION 

If your Registration Information changes during your subscription to Mashvisor, you may update it any time via the Service.
