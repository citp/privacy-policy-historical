                    Privacy</span><br>
                    As part of an industry dealing with sensitive financial information, 
                    MasterCard has always recognized the importance of consumer 
                    privacy. Years ago, we implemented policies and programs designed 
                    to create an awareness of these issues and to help protect 
                    your privacy. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Today, with the rise of the Internet, concern about privacy 
                    has sky-rocketed. MasterCard's commitment to your privacy 
                    has evolved with technology and encompasses our website and 
                    online relationships. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>MasterCard's consumer privacy initiatives include:</p>
                  <ul>

                  <p><span class="copyb">Website Privacy Statement </span><br>
                    MasterCard respects and upholds your right to privacy protection 
                    under the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 and we are required 
                    to comply with the National Privacy Principles in respect 
                    of the collection, use, disclosure and handling of personal 
                    information. We respect your right to privacy at all times. 
                    This includes the time you spend with us here, on mastercard.com/au. 
                    Each time you come to our website, you may provide two levels 
                    of information about your visit:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p> 1. Statistics collected on an aggregate basis as you browse 
                      the site, and<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Personal information you knowingly choose to furnish. 
                    </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p> We want you to be aware of how we handle this information. 
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="copyb">1. Statistics about your visit</span><br>
                    As you browse the site, MasterCard's computer collects information 
                    about your visit, not about you personally. We monitor statistics 
                    such as: <br>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>How many people visit our site <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>How many people return to our site <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Which pages people visit on our site <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Where people were before they came to mastercard.com/au 
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>The number of people who leave to visit another site promoted 
                      on mastercard.com/au <br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This information is collected on an aggregate basis. No personal 
                    information is associated with the statistics. For example, 
                    while we can determine that on a specific day the site had 
                    thousands of visitors, we do not know anything about those 
                    visitors in terms of name, e-mail address or any other personal 
                    data. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Different technologies are used to collect aggregate statistics. 
                    These include: cookies and web server logs. Web server logs 
                    tell which pages are more and less popular in our site and 
                    where people were before they came to mastercard.com/au. Cookies 
                    tell how many people visit MasterCard's site, how many people 
                    return to our site, and what language preferences our users 
                    have.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>These statistics are used to monitor traffic so we can effectively 
                    handle site capacity. The statistics also help us determine 
                    which parts of the site are most popular. With this information 
                    we can continually improve the MasterCard site to better meet 
                    the needs of cardholders, merchants and prospective customers.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="copyb">2. Personal Information You Choose to 
                    Share </span><br>
                    Throughout the MasterCard site, you have the opportunity to 
                    send e-mails, register to download and order MasterCard brand 
                    marks, request brochures, enter contests and respond to various 
                    promotions. If you choose to participate in any of these activities, 
                    you will be providing MasterCard with some type of personal 
                    information about yourself. <br>
                    In terms of personal information on the MasterCard site, you 
                    can be assured that: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>MasterCard does not collect personal information from 
                      you unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. 
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>If you do choose to provide us with personal information, 
                      MasterCard uses it only for the purpose specified. <br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>For example, if you give us personal information, as part 
                    of the registration process in one of our promotions, and 
                    consent to us advising you of future promotions, the information 
                    will be used only as necessary to conduct the promotionthis 
                    reason. and to advise you of future MasterCard promotions 
                    only if you consent to receiving such information. MasterCard 
                    does not use this information for any other purpose. Nor do 
                    we sell, rent or give this information to any other entity. 
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>As another example, a special area on our site allows you 
                    to report problems you have had using your MasterCard or other 
                    situations requiring personal attention. Messages sent via 
                    this form are all individually read by our Customer Service 
                    department. Information you send to our Customer Service department 
                    is used only to help resolve your problem and is otherwise 
                    kept completely private. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>MasterCard uses the services of data capture and management 
                    organisations to assist in the organisation and administration 
                    of this website. Accordingly it is necessary for us to share 
                    personal information collected through this website with these 
                    organisations. </p>

                    If your personal information changes (such as your address), 
                    or if you no longer wish us to keep your personal information 
                    on file, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update

                    any administrative costs that we may incur in providing personal 
                    information to you. If you believe for any reason that we

                    you may ask us to correct it. <br>

                    The foundation for all of MasterCard's efforts in the area 
                    of consumer privacy is <a href="position.html" class="copylink">MasterCard's 
                    Privacy Position</a>, adopted at the end of 1995. The purpose 
                    of the Privacy Position is to provide flexible guidelines 
                    that can be adapted to meet the demands of changing technology 
                    and varying consumer expectations regarding privacy. These 
                    guidelines apply worldwide, but note that in Australia and 
                    certain other countries additional privacy protections or 
                    procedures are required by law and are observed by MasterCard.

                    MasterCard will continue to stay at the forefront of the critical 
                    issue of privacy. In addition to consumer education and policy 
                    implementation, MasterCard's efforts include ongoing research 
                    into consumer attitudes on privacy and continuing communications 
                    with others in our industry. <br>
