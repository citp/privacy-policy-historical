You can visit and enjoy massport.com without disclosing any personal identifying information about yourself. However, we offer some special services including, but not limited to, FlightTracker,site, Subscription via E-mail, Construction Updates via E-mail, and online Form and Publication Requests. In order for these services to work properly, we must collect some basic information from you. If you submit any personal identifying or personal contact information to us, you can be assured that we will not sell, lease or share this information with anyone else, except as follows: (1) as may be required by the Massachusetts General Laws, including the Public Records Law (M.G.L. Chapter 66, Section 10); (2) in the course of a law enforcement investigation; or (3) in the event of a suspected attempt to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage (an attack by hackers, for example).

##### Web Server Activity Logs

Like most web servers on the Internet,massport.com servers collect and store all of the information that your web browser sends when it requests a web page including:

  * The name, domain and numerical address of the "host" computer (typically a computer belonging to your Internet Service Provider and not your personal computer) from which you access the Internet;
  * The date and time you accessed massport.com;
  * The Internet address of the web page you came from;
  * The page you requested and the amount of data sent to your computer; and
  * The information your web browser sends to massport.com, which typically identifies the browser software and may also indicate operating system and the type of CPU in your system.
  * It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user from this information.



We develop summary reports, or logs, from the information collected. These logs are analyzed periodically in order to study site usage over time and to perform studies in order to improve the site's organization, performance and usefulness. The raw data used to develop these logs are erased periodically as a part of routine system maintenance.

##### Electronic Mail

When you send us personal identifying information via E-mail (that is, in a message, question or comment or by filling out a form that e-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your request. We may forward your E-mail to other Massport employees or contract personnel who are better able to answer your question. The E-mail itself may be retained as required by Massachusetts Laws and regulations governing the retention of public records.
