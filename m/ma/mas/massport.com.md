# Massport - Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how the websites maintained by the Massachusetts Port Authority collect and utilize information supplied by our visitors. **This policy may change from time to time as may be appropriate**. You can visit and enjoy our Websites without disclosing any personal identifying information about yourself.

This website uses Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the site. Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of www.massport.com, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google Analytics features implemented on this site include Display Advertising (Demographics and Interest Reporting). We use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics only to maintain this site’s functionality, responsiveness and improve content. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics regarding your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics [Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html).

The Google Analytics tool uses “cookies” which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors’ use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity for the Massachusetts Port Authority. Users may enable currently available opt-outs for web and ads to avoid sharing this information.

We offer some special services such as FlightTracker, site Subscription via E-mail, Construction Updates via E-mail, and online Form and Publication Requests. In order for these services to work properly, we must collect some basic information from you. If you submit any personal identifying information to us, you can be assured that we will not sell, lease or share this information with anyone else without your permission, except as follows: (1) as may be required by the Massachusetts General Laws, including the Public Records Law (M.G.L. Chapter 66, Section 10); (2) in the course of a law enforcement investigation; or (3) in the event of a suspected attempt to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage (an attack by hackers, for example).

Massachusetts Port Authority reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Please review it frequently. If we make changes to this policy, we will notify you on this page.
