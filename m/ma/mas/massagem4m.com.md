# Massage M4M Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

  * This policy covers how MassageM4M treats personal information that we collect and receive, including information related to your past use of MassageM4M products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that MassageM4M does not own or control, or to people that MassageM4M does not employ or manage. 
  * MassageM4M actively monitors our own privacy policy on a regular basis to make sure we are adhering to our own Privacy Policy.



**Information Collection and Use**

_General_

  * MassageM4M collects personal information when you register with MassageM4M, when you use MassageM4M products or services, when you visit MassageM4M pages or the pages of certain MassageM4M partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. MassageM4M may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.
  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, and personal interests. For some financial products and services we might also ask for your address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. When you register with MassageM4M and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
  * MassageM4M collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer.
  * MassageM4M automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, MassageM4M cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.
  * MassageM4M uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.



_Children_

  * When a child under age 18 attempts to register with MassageM4M, we do not allow such registration and attempt to prevent anyone under age 18 from using MassageM4M.
  * MassageM4M does not contact children under age 18 about special offers or for marketing purposes at all.
  * MassageM4M does not ask a child under age 18 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity or promotion.



**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

  * MassageM4M does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:


  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with MassageM4M under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help MassageM4M communicate with you about offers from MassageM4M and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of MassageM4M's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if MassageM4M is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, MassageM4M will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

  


  * MassageM4M displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.


  * MassageM4M does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
  * MassageM4M advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).

  


  * MassageM4M works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. For more information regarding providers of products or services that you've requested please read our detailed reference links.

  * MassageM4M may set and access MassageM4M cookies on your computer.
  * MassageM4M lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to MassageM4M's cookies.
  * MassageM4M uses web beacons to access MassageM4M cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with MassageM4M products and services.
