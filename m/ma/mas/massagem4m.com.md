## Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * MassageM4M does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with MassageM4M under confidentiality agreements.

You further acknowledge and agree that MassageM4M may, in its sole discretion, preserve or disclose your content, as well as your information, such as email addresses, IP addresses, timestamps, and other user information, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal process; enforce the terms and conditions; respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties; respond to claims that contact information (e.g. phone number) of a third-party has been posted or transmitted without their consent or as a form of harassment; protect the rights, property or personal safety of MassageM4M, its users or the general public.

    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of MassageM4M's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
    * We transfer information about you if MassageM4M is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, MassageM4M will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * MassageM4M displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
    * MassageM4M does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
