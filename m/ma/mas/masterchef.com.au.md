The terms of Ten’s overarching [privacy policy](http://ten.com.au/privacy-policy.htm) as well as this Facebook App Privacy Policy, apply to content which you may provide to Ten during your use and interaction with Ten’s Facebook Apps.

As a registered Facebook user, you are subject to Facebook's privacy policy as well as other relevant user terms and conditions. Please make sure you are familiar with all relevant terms and conditions which apply to you as a user of Facebook. 

If there is a conflict between the Ten Facebook App’s Privacy Policy and Facebook's terms and conditions, guidelines and privacy policies then as between you and us, Ten’s Facebook App’s Privacy Policy (this document) will prevail.

**2.  What information does Ten collect?

A. Facebook Data

**When you log into a Ten App for the first time, it may (depending on the type of App that it is), ask you for permission to access some of your Facebook Profile information for example, it may ask permission to have access to your:

(a) Basic Information (which includes your name, profile pictures, user name, and other information forming your Basic Account Information on Facebook);

(b) Profile Information (including your birthday, groups, hometown, likes, and location etc.); and

(c) your photos. 

We call this information ‘Facebook Data’. This is called Facebook data because it is data that is supplied by you to Facebook and then by Facebook to Ten.

If you decide not to grant permission to the relevant Ten Facebook App to have access to your Facebook Data, you may not be able to use that Ten Facebook App. 

**B.  Independent Data**During your interaction with our Apps, you may also independently provide us with information about yourself, for example, if you enter a competition or fill out a form through a functionality provided within the App itself.
