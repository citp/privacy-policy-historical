<font size="3" face="arial, helvetica">The <b>MassLive</b>  Web site is maintained by <b>MassLive, 136 West Street, Northampton, Mass., 01060</b>.  We can be reached  by e-mail at <a href="mailto:webmaster@masslive.com">webmaster@masslive.com</a>.</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial, helvetica">



<b>HOW MASSLIVE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</b>:  This site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.  A user's personally identifiable information may be used by <b>MassLive</b> and its affiliates for editorial purposes.  <b>MassLive</b> may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes. We may share your personally identifiable information with other companies with which it conducts business.  For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information to them.

Or if you choose to purchase items through our commerce site, we will
forward your information to third parties for credit card processing and
order fulfillment. 

Thank you in advance for taking care of this small matter, so it will be in
place as e-commerce gets rolled out to each site.




 We also sometimes provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs. While <b>MassLive</b> will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided, <b>MassLive</b> does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of any third parties.</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial, helvetica">



<b>Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information on any part of MassLive, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@masslive.com"><font size="3" face="arial, helvetica" color="#990000">webmaster@masslive.com</font></a>, <i>before</i> submitting any information.</b></font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial, helvetica">



We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes.  For example, we might report to our advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35.</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial, helvetica">



Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial, helvetica">

You also may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.  <b>MassLive</b> does not control these cookies and these cookies are not subject to this policy.  The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is common in the Internet industry.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.  However, it is possible that some portions of  <b>MassLive</b> will not function properly if you do so.

<b>PARENTS</b>:  We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating.

Any personally identifiable information collected by <b>MassLive</b> from children above 13 (that we are aware are children above 13) will be used only for <b>MassLive</b> internal purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment and for fulfilling requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database.

Additionally, anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other companies which we do business with, for statistical and market research purposes as described above.  Finally, you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his name, e-mail address, etc. on various forums, or chat areas, such disclosure may result in unsolicited messages from other parties.
