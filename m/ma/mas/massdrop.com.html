</blockquote>
<p><em>Personal information we collect from third parties</em></p>
<p>2.6    From time to time, we may receive information about you from third parties and other users:</p>
<p><strong>Information obtained from third parties.</strong>  We may obtain information from third parties to enhance or supplement our existing user information. We may also collect information about you that is publicly available. We may combine this information with the information we collect from you directly. For example, we may obtain information when you log in through a third-party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook or Google.</p>
<p><strong>Information provided by social networks you connect to our Service.</strong> If you connect a social network, such as Facebook, to our Service we will collect personal information from the social network in accordance with your privacy settings on that social network. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you interact with us through a social media site or third-party service, such as when you like, follow, or share our content on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, or other sites, we may receive information from the social network, including your profile information, picture, user ID associated with your social media account, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties.</p>
<p>The data we receive is dependent on your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service.</p>
<p>2.7    We may use this information to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    authenticate your identity, allow you to access and use certain features of the Service and to create a public profile for you; and</p>
<p>(b)    inform our advertising and marketing, and the development of new products and features available through our Service, or to otherwise monitor and improve our Service.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Personal information we collect about you automatically</em></p>
<p>2.10 We also automatically collect personal information indirectly about how you access and use the Service and information about the device you use to access the Service. The list below sets out the categories of personal information we collect about you automatically and how we use that information:</p>
<p><strong>Information about how you access and use the Service.</strong> For example, the website from which you came and the website to which you are going when you leave our website, how frequently you access the Service, the time you access our Service and how long you use it for, the approximate location that you access the Service from, whether you access the Service from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service.</p>

This information can include details about the type of device, unique device identifying numbers, operating systems, browsers and applications connected to our Service through the device, your Internet service provider or mobile network, your IP address and your device’s telephone number (if it has one).</p>
<p>2.11 We may use the information we collect automatically to present the Service to you on your device and to determine products and services that may be of interest to you for marketing purposes. We may also use the personal information we collect from you to monitor and improve the Service and business, and to help us to develop new products and services.</p>
<p>2.12 The processing of the personal information we collect from you automatically is necessary for our legitimate interests, namely: to tailor the Service to the user and to improve the Service generally; to monitor and resolve issues; for marketing purposes; to communicate with users; to contact users; and for the detection and prevention of fraud.</p>
<p><em>All personal information</em></p>
<p>2.13 We may link or combine the personal information we collect about you and the information we collect automatically. This allows us to provide you with a personalised experience regardless of how you interact with us.</p>
<p>2.14 We may anonymise and aggregate any of the personal information we collect (so that it does not directly identify you). We may use anonymised information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving our Service and developing new products and features. We may also share such anonymised information with others.</p>
<p>2.15 The processing of personal information in this way is necessary for our legitimate interests, namely to monitor and improve our Service.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-marketing-communications">4.    MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
<p>4.1 Our Service is a community where users can discuss and discover new products or features and receive updates and offers on products. We will provide you with updates about the products you have requested or in which you have shown an interest in accordance with the functionality of our Service. To do this, we will use the personal information we collect about you to send you information and updates about products you have requested or in which you have shown an interest on our Service. Most messages we send will be by email.</p>
<p>4.2 If you are in the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"), we will only send you marketing messages if you have given us your consent to do so. If you do not want to receive messages from us, you will be able to tell us by selecting certain boxes on forms we use when we first collect your contact details or by refusing or withdrawing your consent.</p>
<p>4.3 You can change your preferences about the notifications you receive by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our emails or logging into your account on our website and changing your preferences, although this will not unsubscribe you from administrative emails from us.</p>
<h2 id="5-storing-and-transferring-your-personal-information">5.    STORING AND TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>5.1 <strong>Retention periods.</strong> We will store payment and transaction information for up to 6 years from the date of your purchase. For all other categories of personal data, we will store it for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out above and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.</p>
<p>5.2 <strong>Security.</strong> We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, change or damage. All personal information we collect will be stored on our secure servers, and all transfers of personal information will be protected by TLS encryption technology. We will never send you unsolicited emails or contact you by phone requesting your account ID, password, credit or debit card information or national identification numbers.</p>
<p>5.3 <strong>International Transfers of your Personal Information.</strong> As we are located in the USA, any information you provide will initially be collected and stored in the USA.

<p>8.1 We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third party services to collect information about your use of our Service over time so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other websites, apps or services you may use, and on other devices you may use.</p>
<p>8.2 Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. We and our third party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.</p>
<p>8.3 We may also use certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Universal Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Doubleclick advertising cookie) or other third party cookies together to inform, optimise, and display ads based on your past visits to the Service. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at <a href="https://google.com/ads/preferences">https://google.com/ads/preferences</a> or by vising NAI’s online resources at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s and DAA’s or Your Online Choices online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.</p>
<p>8.5 Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.</p>

Drop has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>
<h4 id="purpose">Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of this Drop Privacy Shield Statement (“<strong>Statement</strong>”) is to outline how we comply with the Principles with respect to the EU and Swiss personal information we collect and subsequently transfer into the United States. If you would like to obtain additional information regarding our privacy practices in connection with information collected on this website in general, please refer to our Privacy Policy. If there is any conflict between this Statement and the Privacy Policy, this Statement shall prevail.</p>
<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p>This Statement applies to any personal information received by Drop from the European Union or Switzerland in reliance on Privacy Shield.</p>
<h3 id="drop-data-processing-activities">Drop Data Processing Activities</h3>
<p>Drop at times acts as a data controller when processing personal data transferred from the EEA or Switzerland. Though the types of data Drop collects and processes may vary depending on the Terms of Service and our customers’ preferences, data we collect typically includes personal information relating to contact information, transaction and purchase history information, web browsing behavior and other information relating to a user’s device used to access the services, and other information as described in our Privacy Policy. Drop processes this data to provide our business and consumer services; customer service and product support; communications and marketing; online advertising; analytics to inform and improve our services; and for other internal purposes.</p>
<h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Notice.</strong> We will provide individuals with notice of our data collection and processing practices in our Privacy Policy, describing what personal information we collect, the purpose and use of personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we may share such information (and the purposes for which we do so), the individual’s right to access such information, the choices and means through which the individual may limit the use and disclosure of personal information, and other disclosures consistent with the Notice Principle.</p><p>You can read about our data collection and processing practices in our main Privacy Policy.</p><p></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Choice.</strong> We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share their data with third parties other than our agents and service providers, or before we use it for a purpose other than it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. Please note that data sharing only takes place after an active opt-in using functionality within the Service. To limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to Drop Support.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third Parties).</strong> Drop may transfer personal information to certain third parties (as described in our Privacy Policy). Where we transfer personal information to a third party, will take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure the third-party processes personal information for limited and specified purposes and in a manner consistent with Drop’s Privacy Shield obligations. Where the transfer is to a third-party agent acting on our behalf, Drop may be liable if such third parties fail to meet those obligations, and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Security.</strong> We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.</strong> We will process personal information in a manner that is compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by individuals. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Access.</strong> EU and Swiss individuals have the right to reasonable access to the personal information about you that we hold. On request, we will also take reasonable steps to correct, update, amend or delete any information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of doing so would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights of third parties would be violated.</p><p>An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct their query to <a href="https://drop.com/support">Drop Support</a>. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Jurisdiction and Enforcement.</strong> As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lawful Requests.</strong> Drop may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Contact Drop and Recourse</strong> </p><p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Drop commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.  If you have any questions about this Statement or the information that we collect from you in reliance on Privacy Shield, please contact us at <a href="https://drop.com/support">Drop Support</a>.</p><p></p>
</li>
</ol>

Drop takes all concerns about privacy and use of personal information very seriously, and shall endeavor to reply to you within 45 days of receiving a complaint.</p>
