The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world. It's important to Masterstudies to help our users and customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.

If for some reason you believe Masterstudies has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at webmaster@masterstudies.com and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.

**CUSTOMER PROFILES  
**

As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.

When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification number, and then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across the Masterstudies website.

**What we do with the information you share**

When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your account, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Masterstudies will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Masterstudies or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Masterstudies and its family of Websites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Masterstudies, its Websites, or the public.
