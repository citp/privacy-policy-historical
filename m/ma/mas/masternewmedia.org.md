# MasterMind Privacy Policy

**Commitment to privacy and security.**

Whether you are a Robin Good customer, subscriber or just visiting the Master New Media Web site, I always make sure that all steps required are taken to safeguard the information you provide to me.

The law gives you certain privacy rights. Robin Good offers you more.

I do not sell or share customer information with outside marketers who may want to offer you their own products and services.

I do not provide your contact information to any third party unless personally authorized by you.

You can subscribe to my free [Master Mind Explorer](http://www.masternewmedia.org/mastermindexplorer.htm) newsletter by providing your first name and email address. You may unsubscribe at any time without specifying any particular reason. Each issue of the newsletter contains unsubscribe instructions.

Security is ensuring no one can take the information you have shared in confidence with Robin Good and Master New Media. I keep your information secure and confidential.

  
**Making the Security of Information a Priority**

Keeping personal and private information secure is one important responsibility. To do this, I maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect customer information.

Employees are authorized to access customer information only when they need it to provide you with accounts and services or to maintain your account.

Our employees are bound by a code of ethics that requires confidential treatment of customer information and are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to follow this code.
