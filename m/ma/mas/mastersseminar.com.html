    <p align="center">PRIVACY POLICY</p>
    <p>Immortal   Marketing   strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of   Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized   experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name,   e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms   of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email   address to any unauthorized third party. Period."</p>
    <p><strong>How we gather   information from users</strong></p>
    <p>How we collect   and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the   activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.   For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register   for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features,   such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide   information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message   boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like   most Web sites, Immortal Marketing also collects information   automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be   transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your   Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and   hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may   store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter   that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times   you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we   adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through   other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with   information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept   cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of   the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we   may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your   preferences.</p>
    <p><strong>What we do with   the information we collect</strong></p>
    <p>Like other Web   publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver   more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and   do not share your information with anyone.</p>
    <p>Aggregated   Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be   used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your   usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to   help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are   visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated   Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business   partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally   Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you   individually.</p>
    <p>We may use   Personally Identifiable Information collected by Immortal Marketing to   communicate with you about your registration and customization   preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and   products offered by Immortal Marketing and other topics we think you   might find of interest. </p>
    <p>Personally   Identifiable Information collected by Immortal Marketing may also be   used for other purposes, including but not limited to site   administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,   administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications   with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the   operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access   such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law.   In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business,   we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses.   In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred   assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court   order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do   so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to   us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it   appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice   prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
    <p><strong>Affiliated sites,   linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
    <p>Immortal   Marketing  expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect   the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,   including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content   providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and   data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit   to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a   InternetRenegade.com page, certain content that is actually created or   hosted by a third party. Also, through Immortal Marketing you may be   introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,   contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Immortal Marketing is   not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You   should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when   providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
    <p>While on our site,   our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use   cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your   preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our   advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that   enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular   advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer   services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other   technology to gather information. Immortal Marketing does not control   the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting   information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such   third parties.</p>
    <p>You should also be   aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable   Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be   viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without   our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other   individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of   InternetRenegade.com and this policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
    <p>Immortal   Marketing  does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable   Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law.   If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13   in violation of this policy, we will delete that information   immediately. If you believe InternetRenegade.com has any information   from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed   below.</p>

    <p><strong>Governing law</strong></p>
    <p>This policy and   the use of this Site are governed by Florida law. If a dispute arises   under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a   mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Lee   County, FL.

Judgment upon the award rendered by the   arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
    <p>Immortal Marketing's websites are controlled, operated and administered entirely within Florida.   This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and   do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of   any party.</p>
