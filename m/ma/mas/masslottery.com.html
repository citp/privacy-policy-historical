                            Welcome to the Massachusetts State Lottery web site. Your privacy, and the
                            security of your personal information, is important to us. When you visit
                            this web site, we may collect the following information about your visit:
                    </p>

                        <li>Anonymous statistics as you browse the site.</li>
                        <li>Personal information that you knowingly give to us.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                            This privacy policy applies only to the use of the Massachusetts State
                            Lottery web site. Other web sites operated by state agencies have individual
                            privacy polcies tailored to the interactions available through each site. On
                            the Lottery’s web site, you may also see links to external web sites. We
                            strongly suggest that you read the privacy policies for each web site that
                            you visit.
                    </p>
                    <h3>A Privacy Partnership</h3>

                    <p>
                            Your privacy with respect to the use of this web site results from a
                            partnership between the Commonwealth and you, the user. At this web site, we
                            attempt to protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible. However,
                            because some of the information that we receive through this web site is
                            subject to the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/66-10.htm">Public
                            Records Law, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66, Section 10</a>, we
                            cannot ensure absolute privacy. Information that you provide to us through
                            this site may be made available to members of the public under that law.
                            This policy informs you of the information that we collect from you at this
                            site, what we do with it, to whom it may be disseminated, and how you can
                            access it. Based on this information, you can make an informed choice about
                            your use of this site and whether to share personally identifiable
                            information with us through this site.

                    <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

                    <p>
                            We use the term “personally identifiable information” to mean
                            any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including,
                            but not limited to, your name, address, e-mail address, Social Security
                            number, birth date, bank account information, credit card information, or
                            any combination of other identifying information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Information Voluntarily Provided by You</h3>

                    <p>
                            This site collects voluntary information, including personally identifiable
                            information, from you through online forms that you choose to complete and
                            through the e-mails that you send through this site.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Information Automatically Collected and Stored by this Site</h3>

                    <p>
                            The Lottery may place a “<a href="#cookies">cookie</a>”, a small
                            text file, on a visitor’s hard drive. This cookie contains a randomly
                            generated user ID in order to track unique site visits. The Lottery does not
                            uses cookies to store any personal information. This cookie can only be read
                            by Lottery servers and assists us with the statistical analysis necessary to
                            assure site functionality and responsiveness.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            This site does collect and store indefinitely your <a href="#ip">Internet
                            Protocol (“IP”)</a> address (which does not identify you as an
                            individual), as well as information about the date and time of your visit,
                            whether a file you have requested exists, and how many “bytes” of
                            information were transmitted to you over the Web from this site. We use your
                            IP address to assess the frequency of visits to this site and the popularity
                            of its various pages and functions. We will not attempt to match any
                            personally identifiable information that you provide to us with your IP
                            address, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that doing so would
                            provide information that is relevant and material to a criminal
                            investigation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Dissemination of Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

                    <p>
                            We do not sell any personally identifiable information collected through
                            this web site or submitted to the Lottery in conjunction with using
                            functions on the web site, and there is no direct or online public access to
                            the information. However, once you voluntarily submit personally
                            identifiable information to us, its dissemination is governed by the 
                            <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/66a-1.htm">Public Records Law</a>,

                            dissemination of information collected through this web site may be made in
                            the course of a law enforcement investigation, or through compulsory legal
                            process. For these reasons, part or all of the information you send us may
                            be disseminated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            In addition, the information that you voluntarily submit will be disclosed
                            only to Commonwealth employees or officials, or those under contract with
                            the Commonwealth, with a “need to know” for purposes of
                            fulfilling their job responsibilities. They will only use the information to
                            answer your questions, respond to any requests for assistance, and fulfill
                            the Commonwealth’s legal obligations. Where appropriate, we may
                            provide the information submitted by you to the person or company that is
                            the subject of your inquiry, or to a government agency responsible for the
                            matters referred to in your communication.

                    <h3>Security</h3>

                    <p>
                            Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, you should not send
                            information that you consider highly sensitive through this Web site. We use
                            standard security measures to ensure that your personally identifiable
                            information is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We
                            also use software programs to monitor network traffic to identify
                            unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause
                            damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts
                            are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Special Protections Against Misuse Of Personally Identifiable Information Within Commonwealth Offices</h3>

                    <p>
                            In 1999 <a href="http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/source/mass/eo/eotext/EO412.txt">Executive Order 412</a> was issued, which enhanced the privacy
                            protection given to any information about you as a named individual held by
                            the Executive Department of state government. <a href="http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/source/mass/eo/eotext/EO412.txt">Executive Order 412</a> limits the
                            collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information within
                            the Executive Department. This site complies with <a href="http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/source/mass/eo/eotext/EO412.txt">Executive Order 412</a>, so
                            all of the personally identifiable information that you submit to this site
                            is given the privacy protections set forth in <a href="http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/source/mass/eo/eotext/EO412.txt">Executive Order 412</a>.

                            your session at a particular Web site. A cookie file allows the Web site to
                            recognize you as you click through pages on the site and when you later

                            An <strong>“Internet Protocol Address”</strong> or
                            <strong>“IP Address”</strong> is a series of numbers that
                            identifies each computer and machine connected to the Internet. An IP
                            address enables a server on a computer network to send you the file that you
                            have requested on the Internet. The IP address disclosed to us may identify
                            the computer from which you are accessing the Internet, or a server owned by
                            your Internet Service Provider. Because it is machine-specific, rather than
                            person-specific, an IP address is not, in and of itself, personally
                            identifiable information.
