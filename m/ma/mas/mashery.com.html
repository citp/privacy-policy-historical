<h4>1. General</h4>

In each instance that you request access to a Mashery-powered Portal that is administered by a service provider other than Mashery, you agree that Mashery may share your Mashery account information with such service provider. Please be aware that a different privacy policy may apply to your use of such Mashery-powered Portal. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every Mashery-powered Portal that you visit.</p>

<h4>9. Security</h4>
<p>The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with visitors to the Website is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, Mashery cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information to us at your own risk. Once we receive your personally-identifiable information, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
<h4>10. Your Acceptance of These Terms</h4>
<p>By using the Website, you signify your assent to the Mashery Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Website. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Mashery will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.</p>
