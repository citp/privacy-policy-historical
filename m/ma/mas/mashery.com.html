Mashery Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="section">

        <div class="section-body">
            <h4>MASHERY CORPORATE PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

<h4>1. General</h4>

<p>Mashery respects the privacy of every individual who visits this Internet site (the "Website").  This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products and services offered through the Website and outlines the information Mashery will collect and how we will use that information. </p>

<p>If you are located outside of the United States, please note that any information that you provide via the Website will be transferred to the United States. By using the Website, you consent to this transfer. </p>

<h4>2. Personally-Identifiable Information</h4>

<p>There may be cases where Mashery will ask you for personally-identifiable information such as your name, phone number, mailing address, and/or email address.  For certain services, we may also ask you for credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers only at your request or for certain subscription services.  </p>

<p>We may use such personally-identifiable information for the following purposes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Registration for certain online activities that you have requested, such as posting on message boards or online forums</li>
<li>Delivering certain products and services, such as newsletters</li>
<li>Confirmation or fulfillment of an order or registration that you have requested</li>
<li>Answering questions or other requests by email or phone</li>
<li>Sending information that you request</li>
<li>Solicitation of feedback from you to assess your satisfaction or other needs and interests</li>
<li>Creation of new tools, features, and services</li>
<li>Ensuring the technical functionality of our network and Website</li>
<li>Assessing and monitoring usage of the Website and specific features or services in order to protect or improve our services</li>
<li>Notifying you about new products/services, special offers, upgrades and other related information from Mashery and other approved third parties</li>
</ul>

<p>Mashery will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. 
Information Sharing with Mashery-Powered Portals.  One of the benefits of registering with Mashery is the access that you receive to a wide range of Portals powered by Mashery.  In each instance that you request access to a Mashery-powered Portal that is administered by a service provider other than Mashery, you agree that Mashery may share your Mashery account information with such service provider.  Please be aware that a different privacy policy may apply to your use of such Mashery-powered Portal.  We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every Mashery-powered Portal that you visit.</p>

<p>Other Disclosure to Third Parties.  Except as stated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Mashery will not disclose your personally-identifiable information to any third party other than: (i) at your request, (ii) to outsource one or more of our internal functions, products, or services, or (iii) to private entities and law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate (a) to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, (b) to protect our own business and assets, or (c) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others.  If we disclose your personally-identifiable information to third parties, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to require that the recipients of such information apply the terms of this Privacy Policy to that information as if they were Mashery.  Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise stated at the time personally-identifiable information is gathered, we will not provide personally-identifiable information to third parties who are not under the direction and control of Mashery. </p>

<p>Business Transfer.  Mashery may transfer information about you if Mashery is acquired by or merged with another company, in which case Mashery will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  </p>

<p>Cookies.  When you view the Website, we may store some information on your computer.  This information will be in the form of a cookie or similar file and will help us to offer increased personalization and functionality.  A "cookie" is an alphanumeric identifiers that we can transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Internet browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser.  With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.  In some cases, some of the Website's features and services may not function properly if your cookies are erased or disabled.</p>

<p>Server Logs.  When you use the Website, our servers automatically record information that your Internet browser sends whenever you visit an Internet site.  These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your Internet browser.</p>

<h4>3. Information Collected Automatically</h4>

<p>Mashery may also automatically collect non-personally-identifiable information about your use of the Website, such as the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access the Website, and the Internet address of the Internet site from which you linked directly to our Website.  This information will not be linked to personally-identifiable information unless, during the registration process, or at other times during your use of the Website, we ask for and receive your permission to link your non-personally-identifiable information with your personally-identifiable information.  Mashery may use your non-personally-identifiable information to analyze and enhance the Website, and may aggregate this information and share such aggregated information with business partners, sponsors and other third parties. </p>

<h4>4. Children</h4>

<p>The Website is not directed at individuals under thirteen years of age, and Mashery does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable information from such individuals, unless otherwise stated at the time such information is collected.</p>

<h4>5. Your Rights to View and Edit Information Submitted Voluntarily</h4>

<p>In most cases, the tools that collect and store personally-identifiable information allow you to correct, update or review that information (and any preferences) by logging-in to the specific service and making the desired changes to your registration information in the "My Account" page.  In most cases you may also withdraw your registration or inquire about your personal information maintained by Mashery by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@Mashery.com">privacy@Mashery.com</a>. </p>

<h4>6. Your Rights to Opt-Out, Opt-In, or Limit Specific Uses and Disclosures of Your Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

If you check "yes" but change your mind at any time in the future and no longer wish to receive our newsletter and other special announcements by email you will be able to Opt-Out of these services by: (a) going to your "My Account" page within the applicable Mashery service; (b) following the directions included at the bottom of any newsletter issue; and/or (c) sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@Mashery.com">privacy@Mashery.com</a> and we will take you off the applicable list.  You may also Opt-In to receive communications from us and our partners at the point of registration or by similarly following the instructions above.</p>

<h4>7. Links to Other Internet Sites</h4>

<p>The Website may allow links to various other Internet sites.

These links to other Internet sites do not imply affiliation or endorsement of a linked site. </p>

<p>We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every Internet site that you visit through a link or sponsorship notice.</p>

<h4>8. Interactive Areas of the Website</h4>

<p>The Website may feature message boards, blogs, and/or other public forums where users can share information or where users can post questions.  In addition, you may choose to use certain interactive content, tools, and services that ask you to voluntarily provide information about yourself.  Some of these tools do not retain information, while others may store information in accordance with the authorization you provide at the time you use the service or tool. </p>

<p>Any message board, online forum, or similar interactive service is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service, and Mashery is not responsible for the privacy of information voluntarily provided by a user in interactive areas.  You should think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable information in any public forum because what you have written may be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for purposes unauthorized by you.</p>

<h4>9. Security</h4>

<p>The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with visitors to the Website is of utmost concern to us.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure.  As a result, Mashery cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information to us at your own risk.  Once we receive your personally-identifiable information, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. </p>

<h4>10. Your Acceptance of These Terms</h4>

<p>By using the Website, you signify your assent to the Mashery Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Website.  Your continued use of the Website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.  Mashery will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. </p>

<h4>11. Terms of Use</h4>

<p>Use of the Website is governed by the Mashery Terms of Use viewable at <a href="http://mashery.com/index.php/page/terms">http://mashery.com/index.php/page/terms</a>.  </p>
