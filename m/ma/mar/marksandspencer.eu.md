We do not and will not knowingly collect information from any unsupervised person under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you must not use this Website or submit any personal data to us unless you have the consent of, and are supervised by, a parent or guardian.

## The personal data we collect about you

When you make purchases from M&S (including purchases made in-store, over the phone, or via our catalogue order forms or this Website), access and browse this Website and/or sign up to receive M&S email newsletters or SMS messages, we may collect the following personal data about you:

  * your name, age and sex;

  * where you have registered with us, your user name and password;
  * where you place an order with us, your payment card details;
  * your communication and shopping preferences;
  * your browsing and online shopping activities; and
  * your date of birth.



We may also collect the above personal data from third parties who have your consent to pass your details to us.

  * to make this Website available to you and to provide you with content which is relevant to your individual preferences;

## Use of personal data when choosing Klarna as payment method

If you choose Klarna's payment services Klarna invoice and Klarna account as payment options, you agree that we collect and transmit to Klarna your personal data required for processing a purchase on account and carrying out an identity and credit check, such as first and last name, address, date of birth, gender, e-mail address, IP address, telephone number, as well as the order-related data required for processing a purchase on account, such as number of items, article number, invoice amount and tax in per cent. The transmission of such data is made in order to enable Klarna to issue an invoice and carry out an identity and credit check for processing your purchase with your requested invoice processing method. Klarna thereby has a legitimate interest in transmitting personal data of the buyer pursuant to the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG) and requires such data for obtaining information from credit reference agencies for the purpose of carrying out an identity and credit check. In Germany, this can be the following credit reference agencies:

  * Schufa Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, 65203 Wiesbaden, Germany
  * Bürgel Wirtschaftsinformationen GmbH & Co. KG, Postfach 5001 66, 22701 Hamburg, Germany
  * Creditreform Bremen Seddig KG, Contrescarpe 17, 28203 Bremen, Germany
  * infoscore Consumer Data GmbH, Rheinstraße 99, 76532 Baden-Baden, Germany



Within the framework of the decision about the conclusion, execution or termination of the contractual relationship, Klarna also collects and uses - apart from an address check - information on the previous payment behaviour of the buyer as well as probability values related to such behaviour in the future. Klarna will calculate these score values based on a scientifically recognised mathematical-statistical method. Klarna will inter alia also use your address details for this purpose. Should this calculation show that you are not creditworthy, you will immediately be informed of this by Klarna.

_Revocation of the use of personal data vis-à-vis Klarna_

  1. You may revoke your consent to the use of personal data vis-à-vis Klarna at any time. However, Klarna may remain entitled to process, use and transmit the personal data to the extent required for the contractual payment processing through Klarna's services, legally required or requested by a court or an authority.
  2. You may, of course, obtain information about the personal data stored by Klarna at any time. This right is guaranteed by the Federal Data Protection Act. Should you as buyer wish to obtain such information or should you wish to inform Klarna about changes of the stored data, you may contact Datenschutz@klarna.de.



In addition, we may collect anonymised details about visitors to our Website for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details that we collect for these purposes.

## Sharing your personal data

Except as set out in this Policy, we will not disclose, sell or rent your personal data to any third party.

M&S may share your personal data with other members of the M&S Group who will also act as data controllers and which help us run our business.

We may also disclose your personal information to distributors of our products and service, as well as service providers and subcontractors retained to perform functions on our behalf or to provide services to us, such as warehousing and delivery; marketing and advertising; credit card and data processing; credit checks; software development; website hosting and management; information technology and office services; and legal, accounting and audit service providers.

All service providers and subcontractors that act on our behalf are contractually obliged to only use any personal information they receive from M&S for the purposes of performing functions on our behalf or providing services to us, or as otherwise required by law, and to protect such information with appropriate security measures.

In the event that a third party acquires all or part of our business and/or assets, we may disclose your personal data to that third party in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, we reserve the right to disclose your personal data to third parties as part of any business or asset sale carried out if M&S or other M&S Group companies has gone into insolvency or any similar situation, but only where lawful and compliant with Privacy Laws.

We may also disclose your personal data where necessary to comply with applicable laws or an order of a governmental or law enforcement body.
