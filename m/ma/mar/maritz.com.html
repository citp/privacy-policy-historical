Notice</p>
<div id="faqcontent8" class="switchgroup1">
<p class="answer">Maritz collects personal data from and about individuals for use generally in connection with the operation of its business. Such personal data may be used by Maritz to provide incentive, performance improvement, loyalty marketing, learning, travel, market research, or other goods and services to its clients. In addition, Maritz may use personal data in order to properly manage the employment or contractor relationship with the individual that is the subject of such data. Maritz may disclose personal data to third parties when such disclosure is necessary or appropriate for Maritz' provision of such services to its clients or otherwise for Maritz' operation of its business. Maritz may also disclose personal data to third parties in circumstances described in the "Onward Transfer to Third Parties" section below.<br>
<br>
Any complaints or questions should be directed to Maritz' Chief Privacy Officer, Derek C. Mays, whose contact information is as follows: 1375 N. Highway Drive, Fenton, Missouri 63099; derek.mays@maritz.com; telephone (636) 827-2170.<br>

<p id="faqcontent9-title" class="handcursor">
Choice</p>
<div id="faqcontent9" class="switchgroup1">
<p class="answer">Except as provided below, Maritz gives individuals from whom it collects personal data the opportunity to opt out from allowing Maritz to disclose his or her personal data to a third party or to use it for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected. For sensitive personal data, Maritz requires such individual to affirmatively opt in and give consent if the data is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose.<br>
<br>
Individuals desiring to exercise their opt out rights should contact Maritz' Chief Privacy Officer, Derek C. Mays, whose contact information is as follows: 1375 N. Highway Drive, Fenton, Missouri 63099; derek.mays@maritz.com; telephone (636) 827-2170.

<p id="faqcontent10-title" class="handcursor">
Onward Transfer to Third Parties</p>
<div id="faqcontent10" class="switchgroup1">
<p class="answer">Maritz may disclose personal data to a third party if (a) Maritz has received the applicable individual's permission to make the disclosure, (b) the disclosure is required by law, (c) the disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of Maritz' business, (d) the information in question is publicly available, and/or (e) the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment of a legal claim.<br>
<br>
Additionally, Maritz may disclose personal data to a third party if the disclosure is to a Maritz affiliate or to persons or entities providing services on behalf of Maritz, a Maritz client, or the individual (each a "transferee"), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the data in question (a) is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection including, without limitation, transferees that are located within Switzerland, the EU or Canada or transferees that are otherwise subject to an "adequacy" finding, (b) has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection, and/or (c) subscribes to the Principles.</p>

Access</p>
<div id="faqcontent13" class="switchgroup1">
<p class="answer">Upon request and consistent with any applicable client commitments, Maritz will permit individuals to access their personal data and to correct any erroneous information. The individual may need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as, without limitation, name, address, birth date, and social security or national health insurance or an equivalent number. Such access may be denied or limited by Maritz, however, if providing such access is unreasonably burdensome, expensive under the circumstances, and/or if giving access to such information would violate another person's rights. In some circumstances, Maritz may charge a reasonable fee for access to personal data.</p>
</div>
<p id="faqcontent14-title" class="handcursor">
Enforcement</p>
<div id="faqcontent14" class="switchgroup1">
<p class="answer">Maritz will conduct an annual self-assessment to ensure that this Privacy Statement is published and disseminated within Maritz and that it conforms to the Principles.

<br>
Individuals may raise any concerns or complaints regarding their personal data directly with Maritz by contacting Maritz' Chief Privacy Officer, Derek C. Mays, at its Fenton, Missouri headquarters. If an individual raises such a concern or complaint, Maritz will investigate the matter and attempt to resolve all issues to the satisfaction of the individual raising the concern or complaint.

<p id="faqcontent16-title" class="handcursor">
Other Maritz Policies</p>
<div id="faqcontent16" class="switchgroup1">
