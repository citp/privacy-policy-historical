<span class="bigTitle">Privacy Policy</span>
<br><br>

<div class="sectionBlock">  	
	<span class="mediumTitle">Governing Privacy Statement:</span>
	<p>At Mark's, we express our customer commitment by respecting your privacy, and are committed to protecting business integrity for our internal and external customers.</p>
</div>

<div class="sectionBlock">
	<span class="mediumTitle">Mark's Work Wearhouse Customer Privacy Policy</span>
	<p>To view this policy in French, please click <a href="/privacyFrench.asp">here.</a></p>
	<p>Mark's Work Wearhouse ("Marks") is a member of the Canadian Tire Family of companies. This Policy is guided by the Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited Privacy Policy, which Mark's is committed to following. This policy covers all Mark's Work Wearhouse corporate stores and franchisees.</p>
	<p>Marks recognizes that the privacy of your personal information is important, and we are committed to protecting it. This privacy policy explains to you what personal information Mark's collects about you, and the use to which that information is put. The policy will also explain how your personal information is kept safe and secure and handled appropriately.</p>
	<p>While Mark's has always focused on ensuring that your personal information is appropriately protected, this privacy policy is also designed to comply with Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act, and corresponding provincial privacy legislation.</p>

	<p><b>What is personal information?</b></p>

	<p>Personal information is information that refers to an individual specifically and is recorded in any form. Personal information includes such things as age, income, date of birth, ethnic origin, medical records and credit records. Information about individuals contained in the following documents is not considered personal information:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>public telephone directories, where the subscriber can refuse to be listed</li>
	<li>professional and business directories available to the public</li>
	<li>certain public registries and court records</li>
	<li>certain other publicly available printed and electronic publications.</li>
	</ul>


	<ol class="noindent">
		<li><b> We are accountable to you.</b></li>
			<p>Mark's identifies the purpose for which your personal information is collected. We do this before or at the time the information is actually being collected. Types of information collected include:</p>
			
			<ol class="withletters">
			<li><b>Individual Purchases</b></li>
				<p>Mark's ensures that it limits its requests for information to what is required to ensure excellent service. Most of the information Mark's collects about you is very basic information that we need to complete a purchase, or to provide you with a refund or exchange. Examples of information that may be collected to complete an in-person purchase or refund may include things such as your name, address, and telephone number, your driver's license, your credit or debit card information, information printed on your personal cheque, and a description of the item requested or purchased.</p>
				<p>Generally, we request your address and phone number only if the item will be sent to you at a later date, or if you are receiving a refund. We do ask for your postal code every time you make a purchase, but this information cannot be linked to individuals and is requested only to track geographical buying patterns.</p>
			<li><b>Internet Shopping</b></li>
				<p>You may visit our website just to browse, or you may actually make an online purchase. If you make a purchase, we collect personal information such your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card information. Even if you do not make a purchase, we have the ability to track usage of our website. We can keep track of the number of times our website is visited, as well as the server from which the site was visited. This type of general usage information cannot be linked back to you personally. This is done through the use of "Cookies". Cookies are small files placed on your computer by websites. <a href="\index.asp">www.marks.com</a> uses cookies to connect your computer to the information stored in our database regarding your order and shopping preferences.</p>
				<p>At <a href="\index.asp">www.marks.com</a>, we use cookies only for tracking your shopping preferences (e.g. sizes in the big and tall section) and for tracking your shopping basket. Without cookies enabled, you cannot shop online at <a href="\index.asp">www.marks.com</a>.</p>
				<p>No personal information is used to generate or store the cookie, and your cookie file will expire after your visit to the website.</p>
			<li><b>Internet Database</b></li>
				<p>In order to better serve you, our customer, Mark's has also created an Internet database. Customers may register on the database, so that you can keep track of your own purchases at Mark's. For example, customers may register their preferred style of clothing and size so they know what to look for next time they make a purchase. Registration is entirely voluntary and customers may correct their information or remove themselves from the database at any time.</p>
			<li><b>Corporate Purchases - "Image Wear"</b></li>
				<p>Mark's may also collect personal information about employees of various companies who are Mark's corporate clients. For example, a company may contract with Mark's to supply all of its employee uniforms. When the employee comes in to make his or her purchase, Mark's collects information about the nature of that employee's purchases, and may provide that information to the employer.</p>
			<li><b>Information Voluntarily Provided</b></li>
				<p>Sometimes you may voluntarily provide information to Mark's. This occurs when you fill out a "How Did We Do Card" (customer response card), providing your name and address, or perhaps when you provide feedback to Mark's through communications such as e-mail, or a letter. Mark's uses that information to respond to your query, and to keep track of customer feedback, which enables us to continuously improve.</p>
			<li><b>Marketing</b></li>
				<p>Mark's does not sell or otherwise share your personal information with anyone else, such as advertising agencies or marketing companies. Mark's sends individually addressed flyers or brochures only to those customers who specifically request that they be added to the mailing list. This information is sent to customers by regular mail or e-mail, depending on the customer's election, in addition Mark's flyers are sometimes included in bulk flyer distributions throughout the year.</p>
			<li><b>Surveillance</b></li>
				<p>Many of Mark's retail stores are equipped with surveillance cameras. These cameras are in place for your safety as a customer, as well as for our own protection against shoplifting. If a Mark's store has a camera, there will be signs posted alerting you to that. Video tapes that record your image are routinely destroyed and not shared with third parties unless there is suspicion of a crime, in which case they are turned over to the police.
			</p></ol>

			<p>For those customers who request to be added to mailing lists or who register on Mark's internet database, personal information is kept until the customer notifies Mark's that it no longer wishes to participate in these programs.</p>

		<li><b>We keep your personal information up to date and accurate</b></li>
			<p>We are committed to maintaining the accuracy of your personal information for as long as it is being used for the purposes we have identified.
