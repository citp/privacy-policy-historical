You shall confirm, before starting to use the MARKAVIP Services, you fully read, understand and accept the whole content of this Privacy Policy, for once you choose for once you choose and accept the whole content of this shared and MARKAVIP Service, you agree to abide by all terms hereof.

l  What Personal Information About User Does MARKAVIP Gather?

l  Which Information Can You Access?

l  What Choices Do You Have?

l  What about Cookies?

l  Are Children Allowed to Use MARKAVIP Service? 

l  Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions.

The information we learn from you helps us personalize and continually improve your MARKAVIP experience. Here are the types of information we gather.

l  Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on MARKAVIP or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our service, and communicating with you.

l  Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses MARKAVIP Services and other content served by or on behalf of MARKAVIP on other Web sites.

l  Mobile Information: When you download or use apps created by us or our subsidiaries, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn oﬀ location services.

l  E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail sent from MARKAVIP if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our User lists to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages for our user. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Communication Preferences.

l  Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share User information only as described below and with subsidiaries of MARKAVIP that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.

l  Aﬃliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with aﬃliated businesses in some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, the businesses operate stores at MARKAVIP or sell oﬀerings to you at MARKAVIP. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share User information related to those transactions with that third party.

l  Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from User lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing relevant services. The Third-Party Service Providers have access to your personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

l  Promotional Oﬀers: Sometimes we send oﬀers to selected groups of MARKAVIP Users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such oﬀers, please adjust your Communication Preferences.

l  Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy entities, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the User consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that MARKAVIP or substantially all of its assets are acquired, User information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

l  Protection of MARKAVIP and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of MARKAVIP, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from Users for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.

l  With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

l  We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

l  We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit/debit card number to the appropriate card issuing company during order processing.

l  It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account and password and to your computer. Be sure to sign oﬀ when finished using a shared computer.

We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is valid. MARKAVIP gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with MARKAVIP. You may review, update or correct certain of the Personal Information that is stored in your user account in our Services (if you have one) by contacting us. We may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details before we are able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. Your right to control or manage your personal data is subject to our records retention policies. 

l  As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such MARKAVIP features as Your Profile, Wish Lists or Reviews.

l  You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in Which information you can access. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.

l  If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your User Communication Preferences. (If you do not want to receive other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those notices will still govern your use of MARKAVIP, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)

l  If you do not want us to use your personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.

l  Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as Click purchasing, Recommended for You, personalized advertisements on other Web sites (e.g., MARKAVIP Associates with content served by MARKAVIP and Web sites using Checkout by MARKAVIP payment service), and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.

l  The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of MARKAVIP essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any MARKAVIP products and services that require you to Sign in.

MARKAVIP does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under the legal age, you may use MARKAVIP only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of majority without the consent of the child's parent or guardian.

If you choose to visit or use MARKAVIP, your visit, use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws of Hongkong. If you have any concern about privacy at MARKAVIP, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our Policy and the Terms, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of User information collected in the past without the consent of aﬀected User.
