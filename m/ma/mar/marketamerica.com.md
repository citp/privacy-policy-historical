# Market America :: America's Most Powerful Business Opportunity

**Privacy Policy**

From Market America's inception, each new program implemented has been layered upon the initial four cornerstones of the Company. Those building blocks are the Binomial Marketing System, UnFranchise® system, Market America's Mall without Walls® product brokerage system, and the constantly evolving and unfolding 1:1 Marketing and Mass Customization concepts.

Today's Internet information technology has provided a medium through which we can more easily accomplish our goals of 1:1 Marketing and Mass Customization faster and on a global scale. Through the use of electronic surveys, online ordering procedures, data collection, e-commerce, and automated customer contact, through follow-up e-mail messages and product announcements, we can better serve you by making your visit a more personalized web experience.

  
**Collecting Personal Information**

To create this personalized experience, there may be times when we request information from you. It could range from limited personal data about you and your family to your product preferences. At other times, we may conduct occasional online surveys in which we invite you to participate. It is SOLELY your choice whether or not to share information with us.

Sometimes we may use "cookie" technology, which allows us to gather information about which browser and search engines you use. This technology will allow you to move faster through our web site once the information is in our database since our computers do not have to re-enter the same information or log you in each time you enter the site. Market America also collects personal information when it receives an application for a Distributor or Sales Representative, or when a Distributor registers a Preferred Customer.

  
**Using Personal Information**

Rest assured that any response you give to any question at any time is kept confidential. Market America never sells, rents, or trades personal information. We may share personal information with our affiliated companies to help service our Distributors, Sales Representatives, and Preferred Customers. You have our guarantee we do have security measures in place to protect the unauthorized use of any material we gather. Market America's Independent Contractors are obligated to treat the information you supply with an identical measure of confidentiality. If you have any questions regarding our privacy practices, please e-mail us at [privacy@morebv.com](mailto:privacy@morebv.com) for clarification. 

Market America collects personal information to provide products and services to our Distributors and customers and to assist our Distributors in the operation of independent distributorships. Market America collects and uses personal information to process applications and orders, calculate and process commissions, verify Distributor identification, and to satisfy legal requirements. Personal information may be used by Market America and our affiliated companies for additional purposes including, without limitation, research and statistical analysis and marketing. 

Market America's greatest assets are its employees, affiliates--be they Sales Representatives, Distributors or UnFranchise® Owners--customers and vendors. The Company values its ties with each of them and works diligently to maintain effective and mutually supportive relationships. Teamwork is our theme. We hope you enjoy your visit with us and that you will return often. 

  
**Market America's Commitment**

Market America is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information in accordance with privacy legislation in the United States and Canada relative to collection, use, disclosure, security and access to personal information. 

By using Market America facilities and continuing to order products and services, Distributors, Sales Representatives and Preferred Customers consent to the collection and use of their personal information as detailed in this privacy policy.
