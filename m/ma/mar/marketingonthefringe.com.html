<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">If you
choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the
content of your email messages together with your email address
and our responses. We provide the same protections for these
electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of
information received by mail and telephone.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">2. Web Site
Use Information</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Similar to
other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard
technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are
Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information
about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through
cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of
visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the
Web sites visited just before and just after our Web
site.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do We
Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Broadly
speaking, we use personal information for purposes of
administering our business activities, providing the products
and services you requested, to process your payment, , to
monitor the use of the service, our marketing and promotional
efforts and improve our content and service offerings, and
customize our site's content, layout, services and for other
lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and better tailor
it to meet your needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Furthermore,
such information may be shared with others on an aggregate
basis. Personally identifiable information or business
information will not be shared with parties except as required
by law.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Occasionally,
we may also use the information we collect to notify you about
important changes to our Website, new services, and special
offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at
any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing
us at the link provided on the newsletter.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What Are
Cookies?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A cookie is
a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous
unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's
computer asks your computer for permission to store this file
in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for
cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser
if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your
privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the
cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you
by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.
However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may
alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If
you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible
that some areas of our site will not function as effectively
when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other
data from your hard drive or pass on computer
viruses.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do We
Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">As you
visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to
differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use
cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is
necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web
server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number
of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are
most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly
improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do
not allow us to gather any personal information about you and
we do not intentionally store any personal information that
your browser provided to us in your cookies.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IP
Addresses</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IP
addresses are used by your computer every time you are
connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is
used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP
addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part
of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that
data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to
you.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Sharing and
Selling Information</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We do not
share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely
identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal
details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to
process transactions or provide services that you have
requested.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Can You
Access and Correct Your Information?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You may
request access to all your personally identifiable information
that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing
us at the usual address.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About
Legally Compelled Disclosure of
Information?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We may
disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other
words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it
or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose
account information when we have reason to believe that
disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact
or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our
Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the
Public.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About
Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We are not
responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to
or from our Web site or the information or content contained
therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as
pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the
users of our Web site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please
remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to
another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including
web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that
Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules
and policies before proceeding.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Your
Consent</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">By using
our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your
personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We
reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with
or without notice.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Our
Commitment To Data Security:</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please note
that your information will be stored and processed on our
computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal
data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws
of your Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent
unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate
physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard
and secure the information we collect online.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This site
allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive
future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue
sending the particular messages as soon as technically
feasible.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Surveys
&amp; Contests</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">From
time-to-time our site requests information from users via
surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests
is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
whether or not to disclose this information. Information
requested may include contact information (such as name and
shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify
the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used
for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and
satisfaction of this site.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A Special
Note About Children</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Children
are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask
that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal
information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service
only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your
parents or guardians.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Acquisition
or Changes in Ownership</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In the
event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its
assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part
of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are
transferred.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Policy
Modifications</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We may
change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes
are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have
given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so
be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured
that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not
use the personal information you have submitted to us under
this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent
with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent</span></p>
