We rely on the following legal bases to use your personal data:</p><div class="indent"><p>8.1.1 Where we have your consent (<strong>Consent</strong>);</p><p>8.1.2 Where we need information to enter into a contract, or perform the contract we have entered into, with you (<strong>Contractual Performance</strong>);</p><p>8.1.3 Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (<strong>Legal Obligation</strong>); or</p><p>8.1.4 Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>);</p></div><p>8.2 In more limited circumstances we may also rely on the following legal bases:</p><div class="indent"><p>8.2.1 Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests) (<strong>Vital Interest</strong>); or</p><p>8.2.2 Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes (<strong>Public Task</strong>).</p></div><p>8.3 When we and FPAs process your personal data, we do so on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity, in order to protect our business and to comply with laws that apply to us. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have requested.</p><p>8.4 <a href="#table">The table at the end of this notice</a> provides more detail about the personal data that we use, the legal basis that we rely on in each case and your rights.</p><p>8.5 Some information is classified as special categories of personal data under data protection legislation. We may process special categories of personal information and criminal conviction information in the following circumstances:</p><div class="indent"><p>8.5.1 In limited circumstances with your explicit consent, in which case we will explain the purpose for which the information will be used at the point where we ask for your consent; and</p><p>8.5.2 We will use information about your physical and mental health or disability status to comply with our legal obligations, including to ensure we are complying with our obligations to treat you fairly and to assess your ability to repay your debt.</p></div><h2>9. What are the consequences of processing your personal data for fraud prevention or anti-money laundering purposes?</h2><a id="9">&nbsp;</a><p>9.1 If we, or a FPA, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide a card and/or product to you, or we may stop providing existing products to you.</p><p>9.2 A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the FPAs, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us by calling our Compliance Team on 0371 522 5146.</p><h2>10. What happens if you do not provide information we request?</h2><a id="10">&nbsp;</a><p>10.1 We need some of your personal data in order to perform our contract with you. For example, we need to know your address and phone number in order to operate your account. We also need some information so that we can comply with our legal obligations. For example, we need to know your credit history so we can assess your ability to repay the balance on your card and/or product to ensure that we are lending responsibly.</p><p>10.2 Where personal data is needed for these purposes, if you do not provide it we will not be able to perform our contract with you and may not be able to offer you a card and/or product. If you do this, we will stop using your personal data for this purpose, but may continue to process your personal data for other purposes as set out in this notice.</p><p>10.3 Should you enter into a credit agreement with us, you explicitly consent in your terms and conditions to us accessing, processing, and retaining any information you provide to us for the purposes of providing payment services to you.</p><h2>11 How and why do we grant third party providers (TPP) access to your online servicing account?</h2><a id="11">&nbsp;</a><p>11.1 A TPP is a third party service provider that is authorised or registered with the Financial Conduct Authority or another European Economic Area regulator or otherwise permitted by law to carry on certain activities on your instruction. These include:</p><div class="indent"><p>11.1.1 accessing information about your account held with us if it is accessible online; and</p><p>11.1.2 initiating payments from your account held with us if it is accessible online.</p></div><p>11.2 If you choose to use a TPP, please ensure you understand how their services work, such as how they access your account with us and how they will protect your information including your personal data. Please also be aware that:</p><div class="indent"><p>11.2.1 If you use a TPP, the terms of your card and/or product will still apply.</p><p>11.2.2 If a TPP is only asking for information about your account (and is not initiating a payment from your account with us), we will assume you have given your consent to us providing the information to that particular TPP and we will provide the information immediately.</p><p>11.2.3 If the TPP is a card issuer who asks us to confirm whether you have sufficient credit for it to initiate a card payment from your account, we will only do so if you have given us your explicit consent to provide information to that particular TPP.</p><p>11.2.4 Although you must not, generally, give your security details to anyone else, you may give them to a TPP if it is necessary to do so.</p><p>11.2.5 We may refuse to allow a TPP to access your account if we are concerned about unauthorised or fraudulent access by that TPP. If we do this, we will tell you why (unless doing so would compromise our reasonable security measures or otherwise be unlawful).</p><p>11.2.6 You must check the information provided to you by the TPP, to ensure that they are authorised or permitted by law to provide payment services to you. If we become aware that an unauthorised third party is using your security details, we may block access to your account.</p></div><h2>12 How long do we retain your personal data for?</h2><a id="12">&nbsp;</a><p>12.1 We will only retain your personal data for as long as it is required in relation to the purposes it was obtained for by us as detailed in this notice. The periods for which we hold your personal data are set out below:</p><div class="indent"><p>12.1.1 When you have an account with us; we only keep details of your personal information and details of your account for such period of time to permit us to comply with any legal or statutory obligations after your account is closed.</p><p>12.1.2 When you apply for an account but are declined credit; we will keep your personal data for statistical analysis, fraud prevention and credit scoring purposes. If you have consented to receiving marketing from us, in the event your application is declined, we will continue to retain your personal data in order to send marketing to you. <strong>Please note that you can withdraw your consent to receive marketing from us at any time by contacting Customer Services, using the unsubscribe link in any email we send you or on your online account management page. Please see <a href="#17">Section 17</a> for more information about how we use your personal data for profiling, <a href="#18">Section 18</a> about the right to object to the processing of your personal data and <a href="#19">Section 19</a> about where we rely on your consent to process your personal data</strong>;</p><p>12.1.3 FPAs can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years by them. For more details about how long FPAs hold your personal data please contact us by calling our Compliance Team on 0371 522 5146.</p></div><h2>13 What measures do we have in place to safeguard your personal data?</h2><a id="13">&nbsp;</a><p>13.1 We know how important it is to keep your personal data secure. We protect your personal data when being transferred and when stored in IT systems.</p><p>13.2 A variety of technologies are employed to protect the systems that are used to store and manage personal data. To protect our systems and networks from attack we use firewalls, encrypted hard drives, antivirus software, host based intruder detection software and authenticated access protection solutions. Our security solutions are designed in line with industry standards to protect the personal data we store or transmit.</p><p>13.3 Access to personal information is strictly controlled. We ensure access to personal data is restricted to individuals on a need to know basis. Training is provided to individuals working within the group who need to access personal data to ensure that personal data is managed securely.</p><p>13.4 When we share your personal data with third parties and organisations as set out in <a href="#6">Section 6</a> we undertake appropriate due diligence with them to ensure they are complying with the terms of their contract.</p><h2>14 When do we transfer your personal data overseas?</h2><a id="14">&nbsp;</a><p>14.1 We and third parties with whom we share personal data with may transfer your personal data overseas so that we can manage your account and provide other services from countries within the EEA (where the same data protection standards apply as in the UK) and countries outside the EEA. When personal data is transferred to countries outside of the UK and the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) those countries may not offer an equivalent level of protection for personal information to the laws in the UK. Where this is the case we and those third parties will ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place to protect your personal information. For example, whenever FPAs transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that personal data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the EEA. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ intended to enable secure data sharing.</p><p>14.2 When we transfer personal data to Mastercard, Mastercard have binding corporate rules in place to safeguard your personal data. A link to the Mastercard binding corporate rules is found <a href="https://www.mastercard.co.uk/content/dam/mccom/global/documents/mastercard-bcrs-february-2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>14.3 We may process payments through other financial institutions such as banks and the worldwide payments system operated by the SWIFT organisation. These external organisations may process and store your personal data abroad in order to fulfil any payment instructions for example when you use your card and/or product. Additionally, the SWIFT organisation has to disclose your personal data to overseas authorities to help them to prevent and detect crime and terrorism. If these authorities are outside the EEA, your personal information may not be protected to the same standards as in the EEA.</p><p>14.4 The countries to which your personal data is transferred and the safeguards in place are set out below:</p><div class="indent"><p>14.4.1 United Kingdom</p><p>14.4.2 Germany</p><p>14.4.3 Ireland</p><p>14.4.4 Netherlands</p><p>14.4.5 Poland</p><p>14.4.6 USA</p><p>14.4.7 India</p><p>14.4.8 Canada</p><p>14.4.9 Australia</p><p>14.4.10 France</p><p>14.4.11 Spain</p><p>14.4.12 Iceland</p></div><h2>15 How and why do we use cookies on our website?</h2><a id="15">&nbsp;</a><p>15.1 We are committed to protecting your personal data (anonymous or otherwise) that we collect about you online. This Section tells you how we use cookies, why, and how this allows us to improve our service. It also tells you how you can manage what cookies are stored on your device. We call it our "<strong>Cookies Notice</strong>".</p><p>15.2 By using our websites (through any device) you agree that this Cookies Notice applies to that use.</p><p>15.3 We reserve the right to make changes to our Cookie Notice. Any such changes shall appear on all our websites and become effective immediately. Your continued use of our website is taken as meaning that you agree to any such changes.</p><p>15.4 Cookies are files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to the device (e.g. Mobile Phone, Tablet or PC/Laptop) you use when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website on the same domain. Cookies do lots of different and useful jobs, such as remembering your preferences, and generally improving your online experience. We also use Cookies as part of our application processes and when you access your online account for fraud prevention and detection purposes.</p><p>15.5 There are different types of cookies. They all work in the same way, but have minor differences:</p><div class="indent"><p>15.5.1 <strong>Session cookies</strong> – Session cookies last only for the duration of your visit and are deleted when you close your browser. These facilitate various tasks such as allowing a website to identify that a user of a particular device is navigating from page to page, supporting website security or basic functionality. Some of the cookies we use are session cookies. For example, they help us to ensure the security of your online account servicing session, and can also keep you signed in while you move between pages or service your account. Our session cookies used for security are designed to be very difficult to read, change, access or use except by us when you have an active online account manager session. They contain no personal information that can be used to identify an individual (for example, our cookie named Identity.Cookie).</p><p>15.5.2 <strong>Persistent cookies</strong> – Persistent cookies last after you have closed your browser, and allow a website to remember your actions and preferences. Sometimes persistent cookies are used by websites to provide targeted advertising based upon the browsing history of the device. We use persistent cookies in a few ways, for example, to remember your username for log in so you don’t have to. We also use persistent cookies to allow us to analyse customer visits to our site, for example our cookie named _ga. These cookies help us to understand how customers arrive at and use our site so we can improve the service.</p><p>15.5.3 <strong>First and third party cookies</strong> – Whether a cookie is a first or third party cookie depends on which website the cookie comes from. First party cookies are those set by or on behalf of the website visited. All other cookies are third party cookies. We use both first party and third party cookies.</p><p>15.5.4 <strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong> – These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, and ensuring the security of your online banking experience. Without these cookies services you have asked for, such as applying for products and managing your accounts, cannot be provided. These cookies don’t gather information about you for the purposes of marketing.</p><p>15.5.5 <strong>Performance cookies</strong> – These cookies help to collect information about how visitors use a web site, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies may collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is only used to improve how a website works, the user experience and to optimise our advertising. By using our websites you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device, however you can block these cookies using your browser settings.</p><p>15.5.6 <strong>Functionality cookies</strong> – These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name). The information these cookies collect is anonymised (i.e. it does not contain your name, address, account details, etc.) and they do not track your browsing activity across other websites. By using our websites you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device, however you can block these cookies using your browser settings.</p><p>15.5.7 <strong>Targeting cookies</strong> – These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are usually placed by advertising networks. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as media publishers. These organisations do this in order to provide you with targeted adverts more relevant to you and your interests. This type of advertising is called online behavioural advertising and those companies providing this advertising are working with the UK’s Internet Advertising Bureau to deliver more information to consumers. To highlight this information, publishers of advertising will, look to place an icon in the top right hand corner of an advert. This icon when clicked, will take you through to the website "youronlinechoices" (<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.com/uk</a>) where there is more help and guidance. By using our websites you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device, however you can block these cookies using your browser settings.</p></div><p>15.6 If you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by any website, including our website, you should do this through the browser settings for each browser you use, on each device you use to access the internet.</p><p>15.7 Please be aware that some of our services, for example online account management, will not function if your browser does not accept cookies. However, you can allow cookies from specific websites by making them “trusted websites” in your internet browser.</p><p>15.8 You may wish to visit the website <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/" target="_blank">https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/</a> which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wider variety of browsers.</p><h2>16 Why do we use credit scoring and automated decision making as part of your application?</h2><a id="16">&nbsp;</a><p>16.1 When you check your eligibility with us or apply to us for credit we may use an automated system known as credit scoring to help us decide whether to lend to you. It is a way of assessing how much you are able to afford to borrow and how you are likely to manage your account. Most lenders use credit scoring to help make fair and informed decisions about lending.</p><p>16.2 Credit scoring takes account of information from three sources:</p><div class="indent"><p>16.2.1 The information you give us on your application;</p><p>16.2.2 Information provided by CRAs and FPAs, including information about how you manage similar accounts; and</p><p>16.2.3 Information that may already be held about you by us.</p></div><p>16.3 Credit scoring methods are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased. Using credit scoring helps us to lend responsibly.</p><p>16.4 You have rights in relation to automated decision making. Please see <a href="#18">Section 18</a> for more details of these rights.</p><h2>17 How do we use your personal data for profiling?</h2><a id="17">&nbsp;</a><p>17.1 We use various profiling techniques to assist us with running our business. By “profiling” we mean the automated analysis of personal data about an individual to evaluate certain things about that individual – basically drawing conclusions about an individual based on a statistical model.</p><p>17.2 We use these techniques for instance in the course of evaluating applications for cards and/or products, to manage your account, to guard against fraud and for marketing purposes.</p><p>17.3 <strong>You have a right to object in relation to profiling. Please see <a href="#18.1.7">Section 18.1.7</a> for more details of this right</strong>.</p><h2>18 What rights do you have in relation to your personal data?</h2><a id="18">&nbsp;</a><p>18.1 You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data, these include the right to:</p><div class="indent"><p>18.1.1 <strong>Information</strong> – Be informed about how we use your personal data;</p><p>18.1.2 <strong>Access</strong> – Obtain access to your personal data that we hold;</p><p>18.1.3 <strong>Rectification</strong> – Request that your personal data is corrected if you believe it is incorrect or incomplete;</p><p>18.1.4 <strong>Erasure</strong> – Request that we erase your personal data in the following circumstances:</p><div class="indent"><p>(a) If we are continuing to process personal data beyond the period when it is necessary to do so for the purpose for which it was originally collected;</p><p>(b) If we are relying on consent as the legal basis for processing and you withdraw consent;</p><p>(c) If we are relying on legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing and you object to this processing and there is no overriding compelling ground which enables us to continue with the processing;</p><p>(d) If the personal data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in breach of the requirements of the data protection legislation); or</p><p>(e) If it is necessary to delete the personal data to comply with a legal obligation</p></div><p>18.1.5 <strong>Restriction</strong> – Ask us to restrict our data processing activities where you consider that:</p><div class="indent"><p>(a) Personal data is inaccurate;</p><p>(b) Our processing of your personal data is unlawful;</p><p>(c) Where we no longer need the personal data but you require us to keep it to enable you to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; or</p><p>(d) Where you have raised an objection to our use of your personal data.</p></div><p>18.1.6 <strong>Portability</strong> – Request a copy of certain personal data that you have provided to us in a commonly used electronic format. This right relates to personal data that you have provided to us that we need in order to perform our agreement with you and personal data where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.</p><p><a id="18.1.7">&nbsp;</a>18.1.7 <strong>Objection</strong> – Object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying on legitimate interests or exercise of a public interest task to make the processing lawful. If you raise an objection we will carry out an assessment to determine whether we have an overriding legitimate ground which entitles us to continue to process your personal data.</p><p>18.1.8 <strong>Automated decisions</strong> – Not be subject to automated decisions which produce legal effects or which could have a similarly significant effect on you.</p><div class="indent"><p>(a) As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated processes. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if:</p><div class="indent"><p>(i) our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers; or is inconsistent with your previous submissions; or</p><p>(ii) you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.</p></div><p>(b) If you apply to us for credit but we are unable to offer you credit, you can contact us within 21 days of the date of your application to ask to have the decision reconsidered.</p></div></div><p>18.2 We will always tell you about the outcome of a request you have made in relation to the rights discussed above (except in relation to changes in marketing preferences, which are mostly automated).</p><p>18.3 If you would like to exercise any of your rights or find out more, please contact our customer services team on *0333 220 2692. <a href="#table">The table at the end of this notice</a> provides more details about the personal data that we use, the legal basis that we rely on in each case and your rights.</p><p>18.4 In addition to the rights above, you also have a right under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to request a CRA to provide you with information they hold about you.
