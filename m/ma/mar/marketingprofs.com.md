# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

MarketingProfs.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our strong commitment to privacy. 

**Most of all, we value your privacy**. We do not sell, rent, or loan your email address to anybody and will never do so.

This is what we do with your information.

Our site uses cookies to save your username and password if you become a member and decide to use the "Remember Me" option. This means you don't have to re-enter these items each time you visit our site. You can always logout which will delete this cookie from your computer. 

Aside from that, we use session variables to aid in the development of various features on the site. Session variables disappear after 20 minutes or when the user exits a browser. Thus, this information is not stored for any reason other than as indicated.

The user's contact information is also used to send a newsletter if you are a member or subscribe to the newsletter. Special offers are sometimes sent to subscribers as well. However, all recipients of the newsletter may opt-out of receiving future newsletters or offers when so desired, and are given opportunity to opt-out of these emails at any time - at the bottom of each newsletter or using the [My Subscription ](https://web.archive.org/d.asp) link on the top navigation bar on the site.

Aside from these uses of user information - and we have no knowledge of this information except at an anonymous level - we do not sell, nor plan to sell any user information to anyone.
