## MarkLogic’s web site is governed by the following privacy principles:

### Principle 1: General Data Collection

Our site automatically gathers certain anonymous traffic information, such as Internet protocol addresses and other numeric codes used to identify a computer. This information is aggregated and does not personally identify you, but it helps us improve the site and the services we offer. For example, we may use IP addresses to monitor site usage to better prepare for anticipated traffic patterns. We may also gather user information that we save on your computer (not on our server) as “cookies” in order to streamline the site experience.

### Principle 2: Information Requests

MarkLogic requests personal information from you in order to gather your contact information, such as name, company name, address, number, email address, and postal code. Some of this information is optional and you may choose not to provide it. MarkLogic does not intentionally gather personal information from visitors who are under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits personal information to MarkLogic and we learn that the personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. MarkLogic may use the information to contact you to further discuss your interest in our company and products, to send information regarding product updates, and to send a newsletter. You can opt out of being further contacted by us, or receiving such further information from us by [clicking here](http://info.marklogic.com/unsubscribepage.html). Except as stated in this policy or as provided in a separate MarkLogic license or services agreement, we do not disclose your personal information to any third party. MarkLogic reserves the right to maintain information on customers who have violated our license and services agreement.

If you are a non-U.S. user of the Site, by visiting the Site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.

### Principle 3: Disclosure

MarkLogic will not sell your individual Information to any third parties. MarkLogic does not disclose your personal information to third parties, except as set forth in this policy and in cases where MarkLogic, acting in good faith, believes that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with a legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of MarkLogic; or (3) enforce our license or services agreement(s).

MarkLogic may share your personal information with third party service providers to: provide you with the Services that MarkLogic offer you through our Site; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and/or to provide other services to the Company.

MarkLogic may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

### Principle 4: Solicitation

By registering at this site, you are authorizing MarkLogic to email you requested documents, a periodic newsletter, and occasional invitations to attend MarkLogic partner activities. MarkLogic will not send you any unsolicited information, including email, if at any time you decide to opt-out of receiving such information by clicking here.
