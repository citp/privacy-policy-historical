# Marriott Online Privacy Policy | Hotel Privacy Policy Information

This Statement was last updated on **November 18, 2011** , to describe the how the privacy statement applies to all of the information we obtain from you and to update the privacy statement with respect to Marriott’s Authorized Licensees, franchisees and certain other commercial partners set out below.

###  Browsing

This Web site does not collect personally identifiable information when you browse this Web site and request pages from our servers unless you provide it to us. This means that we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information just because you browse the Web site unless you:

  * access the Web site from a link in an email that we sent;
  * are a Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards member or have created a profile and you either log-in to your account or choose to be remembered via your cookie, including on your web-enabled mobile device.



In these cases we will know who you are based on the information you previously supplied to us. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header. We collect the HTTP request header information in order to make our Web sites function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on this Web site. We also use this information to personalize content presented to you, better understand how visitors use our Web site and how we can better tune it, its contents, and functionality to meet your needs.  

###  Information We Collect and How We Use It

When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number (if applicable) and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation. We will also use your contact information to:

  1. send you a pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel;
  2. notify you about special offers and promotions as described in this privacy statement; as well as
  3. send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys.



You can opt out of marketing communications at any time. You can also opt out of Marriott research surveys. The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate purchase, register for a Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards promotion, enter a sweepstakes or online game, to enroll in the Marriott/Ritz-Carlton Rewards program or to redeem Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards points. On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly. For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use a third party to provide us with your email address. We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.

Occasionally, you may be requested to provide personally identifiable information about others to us (for example, the name, address and contact details of your travel companion). In such cases, we rely on you to obtain that other persons' consent for disclosing their information to us and inform that other persons about us, how we will use the information and our contact details for any queries.

  * Change your password.

###  Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information

We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. When we ask you for credit card data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line, provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. We also use SSL on other pages where you would enter personally identifiable information. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer or web-enabled device. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."

After information reaches Marriott and/or Ritz-Carlton, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Marriott. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the Web sites covered by this privacy statement is generally processed and stored in the United States.

###  Travel Related Services

To provide you with a single source for purchasing packages that include other travel-related services such as airline tickets or rental cars, we have entered into agreements with select reputable third-party companies that aggregate inventory information from suppliers such as airlines and car rental companies or companies licensed to sell Marriott- or Ritz-Carlton-branded products. If you desire to purchase a package that is facilitated through Marriott.com or Ritzcarlton.com you will be linked to a Marriott/Ritz-Carlton-branded Web site that is hosted by the company. If you choose to purchase a package or Marriott- or Ritz-Carlton-branded vacation, it is necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information to execute the purchase. This information is then provided to the suppliers (e.g., airlines) for the purpose of fulfilling your order. We have entered into contracts with these third-party companies requiring that they secure your personally identifiable information as well as use it only to execute the transactions you request or to market Marriott- or Ritz-Carlton-branded vacation products. The same security and privacy commitments have been obtained from the suppliers. However, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you have supplied directly to a supplier in any manner, in the past or in the future, is controlled by that supplier and is subject to their privacy statement and practices, for which Marriott has no responsibility.

###  Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

In addition to the travel-related services and required information sharing described directly above, Marriott and Ritz-Carlton does use the services of third party processors, such as market researchers, fulfillment houses, email service providers and mail houses that process mail for the Marriott Group, Marriott’s Authorized Licensees, persons authorized by you, and Marriott franchisees as well as such entities and marketing companies that provide these services for the Marriott Group, Marriott’s Authorized Licensees and Marriott franchisees. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Marriott specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.

Except as described in this paragraph and the sections above titled “Marriott Rewards Communications and Use of Customer Information” and “Travel Related Services” we do not permit the sale or transfer of personally identifiable information to entities outside of the Marriott family of companies, franchisees, Authorized Licensees and hotels and our third party service providers for any non-Marriott use without your approval.

The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.
