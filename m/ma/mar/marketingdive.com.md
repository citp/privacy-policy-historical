This non-personal information may be collected through various technologies, including but not limited to server logs, cookies, and web beacons.

We may use information gathered across our network of websites, mobile apps, newsletters, and other products to create a single user record.  Additionally, we may use or combine information that we collect or receive from outside third-party sources to enhance, expand, and check the accuracy of our records.

    1. This includes cases where we share your personal data with one of our advertisers or partners.  For example, when you register for a webinar or download a whitepaper provided by a partner. In these instances, we will make it clear that the data you are sharing will be transferred to the third party. You will always have the option to not have your data shared by not registering for that specific product.

### USE OF COOKIES

Like many websites, we use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to record your preferences, track the use of our products and your exposure to our online advertisements. We may also use these technologies to monitor traffic, improve the products and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. For example, we may recommend articles similar to the ones you’re reading or display advertisements that you haven’t already seen.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features may not work or may not work as designed.

Some browsers make it possible for you to signal that you don’t want your Internet browsing activity to be tracked. Since the Internet community hasn’t reached a consensus on how to honor these signals, we don’t take action to Do-Not-Track requests at this time.

### ONLINE ADVERTISING PARTNERS

We allow third-party advertisers to display advertisements on our sites and in our products.  These third-party advertisers and related ad-serving companies may use cookies alone or in conjunction with tracking technologies such as web beacons to collect information about you when you use Industry Dive products.

We will not provide these online advertisers with access to any personally identifiable information you may have provided to us without your consent.  Advertisers may, however, use persistent identifiers to track your internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond our websites. While we will not provide these advertisers with personally identifiable information, they may already possess personally identifiable information about you, obtained from other sources, and may be able to combine that information with information behavioral data collected when you use Industry Dive products. For example, whether you engaged with their advertisement when it was displayed.

We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies, how they may be used, or the information they may collect and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of those third parties.  

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you may so by visiting www.aboutads.info/ or networkadvertising.org/choices/ or www.youronlinechoices.eu/.

### DATA RETENTION

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as you maintain an account or as otherwise necessary to provide you the Services. We will also retain your Personal Data in a secure backup system for a reasonable period of time in order to assure reliable service and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our network security, and enforce our agreements.

Where we no longer need to process your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will delete your Personal Data from our systems.

Where permissible, we will also delete your Personal Data upon your request.

### THIRD PARTY WEBSITES

Our Properties may contain links to third-party websites or mobile applications. Please be aware that we do not control these linked websites and that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites.

### CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. We will post changes in this policy, and suggest that you periodically revisit this policy to stay informed of any changes.
