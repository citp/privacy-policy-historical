Interest-Based Advertising

When you visit the Sites, both We and certain third-parties (such as Our advertising networks, digital advertising partners and social media platforms) collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites (such as on websites that serve our ads). We may use such information to provide you with tailored advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which Our ads are served. You may see certain ads on other websites because We engage third-party ad buying networks (such as Facebook and Google). Through such buying networks, We can target Our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. The information Our ad networks may collect on Our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve MJI ads, such as the pages or ads you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on Our Sites and on third-party websites that participate in these ad networks. This process helps us track the effectiveness of Our marketing efforts.

Service Providers

We use third party partners to provide Our e-commerce solution and to help operate the Sites and deliver Our products and services.

We may disclose user information to government authorities or to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at Our discretion or as required by law in Our good faith belief, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas and as otherwise required in connection with a judicial or government proceeding or legal process. This may include in connection with the enforcement of this Privacy Policy or Our Terms of Use. We also may disclose user information when We have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interfering with Our rights or property, other users of the Sites, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.

If you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from Us, We may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with Us. Also, unless required by applicable law, We will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your personal information prior to such request. In these cases, please contact that entity directly.

Certain web browsers allow you to instruct your browser to send Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals to websites you visit, informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be tracked. Our Sites check whether user DNT settings are turned. When they are turned on, We act accordingly to prohibit tracking, which may impact the product recommendations and other features that users see on Our Sites.

7\. For Users Outside of the United States: Your Rights

9\. For Users Outside of the United States: Data Transfers

The personal information that We collect from you or that We may receive from third parties, including Borderlinx, will be processed by MJI in the United States. We also may share this information with Our affiliates, including those located in the United States. In addition, Our service providers may be located in countries other than the country in which you originally provided your personal information, including in France where, along with the United States, Borderlinx hosts some user personal information. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the personal information. In particular, the United States has not been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection. When We transfer your personal information to other countries, We will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you are located in the European Union (“EU”) or Switzerland, We will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries outside of the EU that have not been recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection. In this event, We will implement appropriate safeguards, including by entering into data transfer agreements based on the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses in accordance with Article 46 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or selecting U.S. service providers that are certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. You may obtain a copy of these safeguards by contacting Us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section below.

10\. Security

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.

11\. Third-Party Features

Our Sites may provide links to other online services for your convenience and information, and may include third-party features such as apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). These online services and third-party features may operate independently from Us. The privacy practices of the relevant third parties, including details on the information they may collect about you, is subject to the privacy statements of these parties, which We strongly suggest you review. To the extent any linked online services or third-party features are not owned or controlled by Us, MJI is not responsible for these third parties’ information practices.

Please be aware that if you disclose personal information on social media sites, website message boards or chat areas, that information may be collected and used by third parties without Our knowledge and may result in unsolicited communications from third parties. Such activities are beyond Our control and subject to those third parties’ privacy statements.

12\. Children’s Privacy

MJI is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. Our Sites are designed for a general audience and are not directed at children. Accordingly, We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or other age where parental consent may be required) without prior verifiable parental or guardian consent when legally required. If We become aware that We have inadvertently received personal information from a customer without the legally required prior verifiable parental or guardian consent, We will delete such information from Our records.
