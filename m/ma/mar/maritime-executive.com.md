## Lawful basis for processing

We only process personal information where we have a lawful basis for doing so, such as the following:

  * **User consent** \- This is where you have given us explicit permission to process personal information for a given purpose. For example, if you complete one of our general enquiry forms, we would ask for your consent if we wanted to use your personal information for any other purpose. You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. You can manage your preferences within your account or by contacting customer services.
  * **Legitimate business purposes** \- This is where we have a legitimate interest, as a business, to process personal information.

## How we use your personal information

We collect personal information for eight main reasons:

  1. **To provide our service** \- We require some of your basic personal information so our services work as you would expect, for example, delivering the print magazine to your correct address, providing access to our digital content, notifying you of changes to our services and dealing with customer services queries.
  2. **To improve and maintain performance** \- In order to provide you with the best possible user experience, we need to make sure that our products and services work as they should. Using personal information helps us understand how our readers use our website and newsletter so we can make improvements. This includes testing proposed developments on our Sites, reaching out to our customers with article comments by our readers, which remain posted on our systems.
  3. **To bill our customers** \- We, along with our authorized payments processors, securely process your payment information to take payments, give refunds and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. We will also update your payment information, in the event that a payment is unsuccessful. You can manage your payment information at any time by contacting customer services. If your subscription is provided by your employer or educational institution under a group subscription, we will report how active you are for the purposes of billing.
  4. **To monitor compliance with our policies and terms** \- We monitor for breaches of our terms and conditions and copyright policies. For example, we reserve the right to inform the subscription holder if, through use of a group subscription, you are using our content in breach of the terms and conditions or copyright policies of our original content. We also monitor activity on our website and newsletter to detect and prevent invalid or fraudulent traffic.
  5. **To personalize our products and services** \- We improve your experience of our products and services by personalizing parts of our website and newsletter with the information you give us and what we learn about you. This includes showing you articles you may be interested in and recommending editions of The Maritime Executive, industry events and conferences via emails you may wish to sign up to. Where our website have such functionality, you can manage elements of personalization in your account.
  6. **To communicate product changes and offers** \- We want you to get the most out of our products and services, including showcasing our latest content and newsletters. We will contact you with carefully-curated media e-blast offers and promotions, exclusive event invitations and feature announcements. For example, if there are no updates on topics you follow in newsletter, we will send you articles on other topics that we think you might be interested in. You are able to change your preferences at any time through your account or by contacting customer services. We personalize our communications for strategic purposes. For example, we might offer group subscriptions to corporate managers or various organizations.
  7. **For the purpose of advertising** \- We rely on advertising revenue in part to support our award-winning journalism. We need to process your information to understand the effectiveness of the advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant personalized advertising. We use the information you give us and the information we collect about you to serve you with the most appropriate advertisements. You can manage your advertising settings for our websites and newsletter that carry out this activity in your account. If you do decide to turn off personalized advertisements or advertisements tailored to you, you will still see the same number of advertisements but they may be less relevant to you. You may continue to see advertisements that are targeted to you based on other non-personal information, for example, the article that you are reading.
