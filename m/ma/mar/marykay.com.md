Therefore, we do not trade, sell or lease personal information entrusted to us. This Global Privacy Statement describes how we work to maintain your trust.

We strive to be consistent in how we implement privacy policies across the globe. Our privacy policies are designed to comply with the law in each country where we do business and applies to:

  1. All individuals who provide personal information, such as Independent Beauty Consultants, consumers, customers, research subjects, business partners, shareholders, job applicants, employees, retirees, and others; 
  2. All countries where we operate, even where local regulations do not exist; 
  3. All methods of contact such as the Internet, direct mail, telephone and mobile, and for emerging technologies and methods that might be used.

Mary Kay seeks to promote and utilize industry best practices to ensure privacy concerns are addressed and that personal information is protected.

  * Our privacy policies are designed to model internationally accepted privacy principles, or fair information practices, such as those established by the European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

## Why We Collect Information

Mary Kay collects and uses personal information to provide an incredible business opportunity, fabulous products, and services of superior quality for Independent Beauty Consultants and their customers, consumers of our products and services, employees, and others who may come into contact with Mary Kay. We limit the collection of personal information to what we need to know in order to achieve our goal of providing superior quality, value and opportunities. For example, we use e-mail addresses to send Independent Beauty Consultants, consumers, employees or job applicants information they have requested. Independent Beauty Consultant and consumer feedback on products and services is used to improve those products and services. 

We tell individuals what information we collect, how it is used, whether it may be transferred to others to provide the products or services requested, and how to contact the Company or the Mary Kay Privacy Team with inquiries. We provide a link to our Privacy Policies on our websites, and provide additional targeted privacy notices to users who may need additional information about different areas on our websites when appropriate. 

We offer individuals who provide us information choices about receiving further communications from us. Our emails and newsletters are sent only to those who have asked to receive them from us or when requested to be sent to you by an Independent Beauty Consultant. Our communications tell you how to unsubscribe or “opt-out” of receiving future communications. We may ask individuals if they wish to participate in market research, and then contact them if they give us their permission. 

Mary Kay uses technology in order to better serve Independent Beauty Consultants, consumers, employees, and others. We tell individuals when we use technologies that are privacy related. We use internet cookies to collect and store personal information and provide you notice of their use, seeking permission when necessary, depending on the country in which you reside.  


Mary Kay takes steps to make sure that the personal information we use is correct. We provide individuals with reasonable access to the personal information they've provided us so that they can review and correct it, or ask us not to use it.  


Mary Kay protects personal information under company control by industry standard security practices and measures in order to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration of the information. We limit access to personal information to those who have a business need for such information. We do not keep personal information any longer than necessary to meet the business purpose for which it was collected unless contractual, legal or regulatory reasons require that personal information not be deleted for certain time periods. 

We may transfer personal information to Mary Kay databases in countries other than where it was provided. Our Global Privacy Program requires the same high level of security and protection of personal information in all countries with procedures and contracts in place to help ensure this is so. Data may be transferred to a vendor or business partner to provide services for Mary Kay and/or Independent Beauty Consultants. These vendors and business partners are required to protect and manage the personal information to the same high standards as Mary Kay. They cannot use the information for purposes other than to provide the services you, Mary Kay or your Independent Beauty Consultant has requested. 

Mary Kay does not intend to collect information from children under the age of 14, or such other age as designated by a country specific law. We ask for age confirmation on our websites before collecting personal information to make sure we do not collect information from children. 

Mary Kay expects our employees and partners to maintain the trust placed in us by those who give us personal information. We provide privacy training to employees and highlight the importance of privacy in our worldwide business conduct program. Those who manage personal information complete privacy self-assessments to make sure that personal information is secure and protected. We periodically audit privacy compliance. 

Mary Kay privacy policies and data protection practices extend by contract to our supplier and partner relationships. We support industry self-regulation as a flexible means for keeping pace with emerging privacy issues.

As an Independent Beauty Consultant, it is necessary that we use your information in order to facilitate our contractual relationship with you and others, and to provide you with the most up to date information in order for you to be successful in the operation of your independent Mary Kay business. We offer access and choice with regard to your information in compliance with applicable law.  
**  
Choices**

We give you choice regarding how we communicate with you.

**Digital and Electronic Information**

We send you promotional mobile or email messages that you have opted in to receive. Generally you agree to receive these communications when you sign up as an Independent Beauty Consultant or when you join the on-line community available to Independent Beauty Consultants, Independent Sales Directors and Independent National Sales Directors. 

You can stop receiving particular promotional mobile and email messages from Mary Kay and third parties who may send information on our behalf by following the instructions provided in any such message you receive. It may be necessary to continue to send you certain information electronically pursuant to the terms of your Independent Beauty Consultant Agreement and relationship with Company.

**Postal Mail**

In connection with your status as an Independent Beauty Consultant we may mail you offers, product information and marketing tools that we believe are of interest to you.  While certain materials are necessary to be sent to you by mail in conjunction with your status as an Independent Beauty Consultant, you can stop receiving certain promotional postal mail from Mary Kay. Contact Customer Service to update your preferences. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** If you choose to stop receiving promotional messages from us, we will honor your request to the extent we can do so and still facilitate our agreements with you in relation to your Independent Beauty Consultant status. We will continue to send you service related communications. We may need to maintain the information we have collected about you for record keeping, contractual requirements, analysis or other reasons to the extent required/permitted by law. 

**Access**

We take steps to keep your personal information accurate. You can view, correct or update the personal contact information you provide Mary Kay. Most Mary Kay programs provide access to view or update personal information online including _Mary Kay InTouch_ ® and Personal Websites.  If you have any questions, you can contact Customer Service or the Data Privacy Team.

In general, we do not share personal information with marketers outside of Mary Kay. There are circumstances where special offers may be available to Independent Beauty Consultants by third-party companies and in those instances we will only provide your information if we have clearly provided notice and asked for and obtained your consent depending upon your location.  We may share your information with potential customers who have contacted the Company for a referral to an Independent Beauty Consultant, if allowed by law and/or if you give us specific permission to pass on this information to potential customers.  We share information with other Independent Beauty Consultants in order to facilitate contractual obligations pursuant to the Independent Beauty Consultant Agreement, including to your recruiter, Independent Sales Director(s) and Independent National Sales Director(s), for the purpose of honoring our agreements with you and with them.  We only provide personal information needed in order to facilitate support for you and contractual compliance. 

## Third-Party Service Providers

We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf. In so doing, we may need to share your personal information with them. Please note that we provide our service providers with only the personal information they need to perform their services and we require that they protect this information and will not use it for any other purpose. We may rely on a service provider to:

## Sharing of Information within Mary Kay Independent Sales Force

  * When required by law, and/or public authorities.
  * Aggregated and non-personal information



We may share aggregated information that does not identify you for general business analysis. For example, we may disclose the number of visitors to Mary Kay sites or services. 

We may transfer personal information to Mary Kay databases in countries other than where it was provided. Our Global Privacy Program requires the same high level of security and protection of personal information in all geographies with procedures and contracts in place to help ensure this is so. Data may be temporarily transferred to a vendor or business partner to provide services for Mary Kay, such as mailing information or samples. These vendors and business partners are required to protect and manage the personal information to the same high standards Mary Kay does, and they cannot use the information for purposes other than to provide the services Mary Kay has requested. 

Mary Kay protects personal information under company control by industry standard security practices and measures, in order to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration of the information. We limit access to personal information to those who have a business need for such information. We do not keep personal information any longer than necessary to meet the business purpose for which it was collected, though in some cases, contractual, legal or regulatory reasons require that personal information not be deleted for certain time periods.
