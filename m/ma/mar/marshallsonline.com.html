                  <p>Our Website also contains links to other websites operated by the other TJX Businesses. We advise you to review the legal, privacy and security information for each such site to which you link, as the terms and conditions of use and the personal information you provide may vary from website to website. </p>
                  <p>We may use third parties to serve our advertisements on other websites. These companies may use online tools such as pixel tags to report certain information (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our Website and the websites which advertise and feature links to our Website, in order to measure the advertising effectiveness of our ads. We contractually restrict these companies from using your personally identifiable information for their own or any other marketing purposes, or from sharing your personal information with anyone other than Marshalls. </p>
