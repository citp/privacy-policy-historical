### Identifying Subscribers

An individual may be required to register on Our Websites to gain access to content. A registrant is normally required to supply non-personal information when creating his or her account, with the exception of a password.

The use of cookies is an industry standard and many websites use them.

### Non-personal information collected automatically

Non-personal information is collected from Our Websites in the form of web logs.
