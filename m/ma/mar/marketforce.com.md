##### Cookies

When you visit our website or access our services, we will automatically collect certain information such as the IP address or domain name of the device used and the URI address. We also use the following types of cookies:

  * Session cookies - our shopper and client secure sites use session cookies which your computer stores only for that browsing session, once you close your browser, the cookie is deleted. These cookies allow users to navigate around the site using your logon details without having to login again on every page; and
  * Google Analytics tracking cookies - this cookie allows us to understand more about the websites visitors, such as the number of visitors, details of the devices used to access the site or our services, which pages are accessed and the various time details per visit.



For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, please see our cookie policy set out at <https://www.marketforce.com/cookies>

Apart from the uses described in the WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR DATA AND WHY section above, we may disclose your Personal Data to third parties:

  * if a third party acquires any Market Force Information company, or substantially all of its assets, in which case Personal Data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets and the buyer is likely to seek information about its independent contractors. In such cases we may disclose your Personal Data to the prospective or ultimate purchaser and/or their legal and other professional advisers, irrespective of where in the world any of them are located. Where reasonably practicable, we will endeavour to anonymise the data until contracts have been signed and/or request the recipient to contract to keep the data secure and confidential and, if the transaction does not proceed, either to return the data to us, or to destroy it. (Once contracts are signed, the buyer is committed and it will usually be necessary to remove the anonymization so that the buyer can make more concrete plans for dealing with customers and independent contractors).                    
  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; or

We do not sell personal data to third parties for commercial purposes and we only share or disclose your data as authorised in this Policy.

In the case of individuals located in countries where the GDPR applies, we will process any request for disclosure in accordance with either the GDPR and/or the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield, and you may be notified and informed of your choices relating to the disclosure in accordance with the law that applies to you.

##### Where we store your personal data

We use servers in several locations to process and store Personal Data, including servers provided by our third party provider Calligo (<https://calligo.cloud/>) which are located within and outside the EEA. Personal data of independent contractors and other data subjects located in Europe is stored on servers located in countries within the EEA which have been recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate levels of protection for Personal Data. Personal data of independent contractors located elsewhere is stored on servers located outside the EEA.

All these servers are kept in a secure, locked environment with restricted access and we have on our own, and in conjunction with the third parties who operate the servers, established physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.

The Personal Data stored by us may be accessed and processed by staff operating outside your jurisdiction, who work either for us or for one of our suppliers. These staff may be engaged in the fulfilment of your request, order or reservation, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services to us. We will take all steps required by applicable law to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.

The transmission of information via the internet is not secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we do not encrypt email messages and cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the App or our Sites; any transmission is at your own risk. We have implemented a variety of technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, unlawful processing, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, alteration and destruction. These include limiting access to the databases to a limited number of authorized staff, who are required to enter into non-disclosure agreements before access is afforded to them and who can only access the database for legitimate pre-authorised purposes; access to the databases is password protected. We also have in place audit logs, intrusion detection software, anti-virus or malware protection and system integrity tools to further protect data stored on these databases.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of the App and/or our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You are responsible in protecting your account by not sharing your password with anyone.

Also, ensure that when using features such as social networking, chat room or forums, you do not submit any Personal Data that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.

##### Third Party Websites

The App or our Site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates (including, but not limited to, websites on which the App or its services are advertised). If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or use these services.

##### Social Media Features

Our Sites includes features from social media websites, such as the Facebook Like button.

Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. This privacy policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing those features.

The amount of time we hold your Personal Data will vary but shall be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is being processed. We will retain your Personal Data in accordance with the following criteria:

Data Subject | Criteria for Retention of Personal Data

  * The right to access your Personal Data unless access is subject to a legal exception. Exceptions may apply for example where the data is the subject of confidential legal advice and is covered by legal professional privilege.

Access requests are free however we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee to comply with requests when such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

In the case of individuals located in countries where the GDPR applies, to the extent we transfer Personal Data to Market Force Information group companies based in the U.S., for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, we rely on our certification with Privacy Shield (See Privacy Shield below). To the extent we transfer Personal Data to Market Force Information group companies based in Canada, for the purposes set out in this policy, we rely on the fact that Canada has been designated by the European Commission as a country which offers an adequate level of protection for personal data.

Where we transfer personal data relating to individuals located in the EU or the EEA not to its own group companies, but to third parties, we have in place Data Transfer Agreements based on the EU model clauses.
