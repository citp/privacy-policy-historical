# Privacy Policy | Marina Bay Sands

## Application of this Policy

Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd (“MBS”) is a subsidiary of Las Vegas Sands Corp (“Sands”). Sands operates several resort hotel and casino properties in the United States and abroad.  This Privacy Policy is for Singapore and applies to personal data collected, stored, disclosed and/or processed by MBS in Singapore. Sands also owns and operates properties abroad (collectively, the “Non-Singapore Sands Properties,” and together with MBS, the “Sands Properties”).  Information on all Sands Properties is available on Sands’ primary website, sands.com. From there, you may access our property-specific websites and the privacy policies that are linked thereto. This Privacy Policy applies to websites owned and operated by MBS or other websites on which this Privacy Policy, or a link to this Privacy Policy, appears as well as activities at the Sands Properties to the extent Sands notifies you of such activities being subject to this Privacy Policy.  

This Policy is based on the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) and all the associated regulations and guidelines as may from time to time be issued by the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) of Singapore.  In jurisdictions outside of Singapore, Sands’ practices may be subject to different or more restrictive local laws.  For information regarding Sands’ data collection and privacy policies at the Non-Singapore Sands Properties, please review the privacy policies available at those property-specific websites.

By visiting or using the MBS website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please review this Privacy Policy carefully before visiting or using our website, or otherwise providing us with any of your personal data. 

Unless you opt-out and instruct us otherwise, MBS does and will continue to share the personal data that it collects from you with other of Sands’ subsidiaries, including those who own and operate the Non-Singapore Sands Properties, as permitted under applicable law and the PDPA. Personal data that we collect or store in jurisdictions outside of Singapore may, subject to applicable law and the PDPA, be transferred to and used by MBS or other jurisdictions.  Similarly, personal data that MBS collects or stores may, subject to applicable law and the PDPA, be transferred to and used by us outside of Singapore.  When personal data is collected by MBS or transferred to MBS, it will be treated according to the privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy.
