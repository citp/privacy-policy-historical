      its interactive products and services. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to

      <b></b><p><b>Information About All marketday.com,seasonsofsharing Visitors<br>
      </b>In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the
      numbers and frequency of visitors to marketday.com and seasonsofsharing.com and each of its areas, very much like
      television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only
      use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our
      customers use parts of a site, so we can improve that site to ensure it is as
      appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, marketday.com and seasonsofsharing.com
      use a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tell us how and when pages in our
      sites are visited, and by how many people. Market Day and Seasons of Sharing cookies do not collect personally
      identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with
      other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen
      name or e-mail address is. </p>
