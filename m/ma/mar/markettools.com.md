# Privacy Statement | MetrixLab

Website Privacy Statement

In this Web Site Privacy Statement (“statement”), we, MetrixLab BV, headquartered in Rotterdam, the Netherlands and San Francisco, California, USA provide information about how we collect, use and transfer personally identifiable data from you, a web site visitor to web sites that we operate (collectively the “site”).

**Scope**  
This statement covers data collected through the site. This statement does not cover any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, data collection practices of other web pages to which MetrixLab links or data processing practices of users of our service. When MetrixLab refers to this statement in notices and consent requests related to surveys, special-purpose web pages or otherwise, this statement applies as modified in the particular notice or consent request (e.g., with respect to types of data collected or purposes of collection).

**Types of Data and Collection Methods**  
Through the site, MetrixLab receives data that you actively submit as well as data that MetrixLab tracks:

_Actively Submitted Data:_ When you request information, subscribe to a mailing list or a service, register as a user, post to one of MetrixLab-hosted forums or communities, send or respond to an online survey or otherwise actively send us data, MetrixLab usually collects data such as your name, email address(es), telephone number(s), country of residency, and certain information related to the business you represent (if any).

_Passively Tracked Data:_ When you visit the site, MetrixLab also passively tracks information from your computer and Internet connection, such as the IP address of your computer, the date and time you access the site, the Internet address of web sites from which you link to our site, some of the computer technology you are using and your movements and preferences on our site. MetrixLab uses technology that many other web sites employ, including, without limitation, “cookies” or small data files stored on your computer’s hard drive, to collect information such as the aforementioned. In some instances, MetrixLab also uses cookies to collect information in connection with future visits from that web site, to recognize you as a previous visitor and to track your activity at our site. You do not need to have cookies turned on to participate in our surveys or to visit our site. You can refuse cookies by turning them off on your browser, but please note that this may adversely affect user experience and convenience.

_Combinations:_ Unless you actively submit personal information such as your name or address, passively tracked data does not typically allow MetrixLab to identify you personally (even though it can theoretically be done, MetrixLab does not try to find out who you are, unless you identify yourself voluntarily through an active submission of data). To the extent permitted by applicable law, MetrixLab reserves the right to combine passively tracked data or data available via a third party with personal data that you may choose to actively submit. MetrixLab does this on the [www.MetrixLab.com ](http://www.markettools.com/)site and for some survey “panels” (which may be deployed on opinionbar.com or other sites). Specifically if you take surveys from MetrixLab,  we will “fingerprint” your session in order to combat fraud. In generating this “fingerprint” MetrixLab gathers only publically available information from your browser; this includes your IP address, browser version, and other session information.

**Collection Purposes, Use of Data**  
MetrixLab collects passively tracked data primarily for purposes of administering, protecting and improving our site and our systems, to better understand the preferences of our site visitors, to compile aggregated statistics about site usage, and to help personalize your experience on our site. MetrixLab also uses cookies and passively tracked data to protect the integrity of surveys, e.g., to prevent survey respondents from responding to the same survey twice.

For some survey panels, we will verify the information that you, or a third party, provide us and/or combine the information you provide with information MetrixLab may gather from additional sources. Verification of personal data may be done on our systems, or done by a third party. If your personal data is provided to us for verification purposes only MetrixLab will never store any of your personal information on our systems (MetrixLab store only the result of the verification process).

MetrixLab collects primarily for two purposes: Firstly, for the purpose for which you originally sent us the data e.g., to confirm your registration for a service, to run a survey, to allow you to run a survey, to bill for services or to send you information or materials that you requested – for additional information on our solutions please click here [http://www.metrixlab.com/solutions/](http://www.metrixlab.com/solutions/); secondly, for purposes of informing you about products and services; you can opt out of receiving marketing emails as explained in Opt-Out below.

**Disclosures of Personal Information**  
MetrixLab is not in the business of selling or renting your information to telemarketers and we do not share your personally identifiable information with others, except as follows:

If you use any MetrixLab services with a corporate email account (i.e., an account for employees, contractors, etc. as opposed to a personal email account with a general email service provider such as AOL, Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, etc.), and such corporation signs up for an enterprise account with us or is considering an enterprise account, MetrixLab may inform such corporation of your use of our service, so that you can benefit from enterprise pricing and any other benefits negotiated by the corporation for its registered users or otherwise arising from such coordination.

MetrixLab also engages agents and service providers who have access to data, but only to process such data on our behalf and for our purposes under confidentiality agreements.

MetrixLab may share your information as required by law or in the interest of protecting or exercising our or others’ legal rights, e.g., without limitation, in connection with requests from law enforcement officials and in connection with court proceedings.

MetrixLab may share or transfer your information in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business.

MetrixLab reserves the right to use and disclose any information collected via the site that is not in personally identifiable form.
