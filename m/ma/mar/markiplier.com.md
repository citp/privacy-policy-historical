We have technical and organizational measures in place that we believe are reasonable and that are intended to safeguard and protect your personal information against unauthorized access, accidental loss, improper use, and disclosure. For example, we currently use Shopify to operate this website, and Shopify uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software which encrypts information you input. 

However, you should be aware that information transmitted over the internet is not completely secure because of the nature of the internet and that systems and measures used to secure information are not flawless. For these reasons, although we will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, including those mentioned above, we do not warrant the security of personal information transmitted to us or stored by us.  Personal information that is transmitted to us by you electronically is done at your own risk.

Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on settings or visiting the website of your browser’s developer.  If you choose to disable your browser from accepting cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Website.  For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any of our Website products that require you to Sign-in.
