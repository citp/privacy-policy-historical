They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, e-mail address, or any personally identifying information about the user.

**Site Usage Information**  
Marmot Mountain LLC gathers site usage information from both registered and non-registered users. Usage information (such as which pages users visit) is collected through various means. One of these ways is through an IP address, a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are browsing the Web.

Marmot Mountain LLC uses both the personal and site usage information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the site, to customize the content and/or layout of the site for individuals or groups of users, and if requested, to provide information services by email to the user.
