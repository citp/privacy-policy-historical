The Site is not designed to respond to "do not track" requests from browsers.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Cookies</h3> <p>This information is stored using session ID cookies, persistent cookies and various other types of cookies. A cookie is a small data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Third party Information</h3> <p>To help us understand and enhance our interactions with you, we may permit web analytics and other providers to collect and process information on our Site using the technologies described above. Some of these providers have information about you, including personal information, demographic information and interest reports which they will share with us. And we may share your personal and technical information with them.</p> </li></ol><h2>Using Information We Collect</h2><p>We want to provide you with the best possible internet experience and fulfill your orders exactly as you've requested. Additionally, we want to make your experience with Market America a pleasant and positive one. In order to do this, we may use any information we collect for any legitimate business purpose (including, but not limited to, marketing). For example, we may use the information as follows:</p><ol> <li> <h3>Use of Personal Information</h3> <ul> <li>Match you with the Shop Consultant that is the best possible fit for you;</li> <li>Send you promotional offers;</li> <li>Identify your product and service preferences;</li> <li>Customize our communications to you;</li> <li>Improve our customer service;</li> <li>Share your positive product testimonial with others;</li> <li>Include your name, stories, testimonials, product reviews and images in Market America and third party publications, literature and/or other media, on Market America operated websites, on third party websites, at Market America events, on Market America CDs and DVDs, in any other Market America communications to our UnFranchise Owners, partner stores, third party service providers or others, or as otherwise deemed useful or appropriate by Market America.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <h3>Use of Technical Information</h3> <p>This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the Site and to various sections of the Site, the percentage of visits that came from particular key word searches, the average time spent on the Site by visitors, and the average number of page views by visitors.
