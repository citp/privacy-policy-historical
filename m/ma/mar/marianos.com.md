Cookies (pieces of data stored in your hardware) are used to track information including browser type, operating system, IP address, and domain names, as well as logged in status, store selection, and other non-personally identifiable selections, in order to provide a customized experience. Some functionality within the Sites will not work properly if your browser does not accept cookies.

**We provide you with the opportunity to register for an account within each of the Roundy’s Sites. Within your account profile(s), you may choose to provide us with your name, contact information, store selection, Rewards Card number, and dietary/nutrition preferences. This information is used to give you a personalized website experience, including displaying the ad for the store of your choice and showing you specials based on your past purchase behavior.

You may also find entry forms or surveys within our Sites, or the ability to change information relating to a Rewards Card. Roundy’s will only collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide through a Roundy’s Site or email.

We may request that you voluntarily submit personal information such as your name, address, email address, phone number, Rewards Card number, and store selection if you attempt to contact the Roundy’s Customer Service Center via one of the Roundy’s Sites.

If you would prefer that Roundy's not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any information. We do not share this information with outside parties; however, Roundy's may disclose personally identifiable and aggregate anonymous information to companies and individuals employed to perform functions on our behalf (such as contest or promotion administration) or with our affiliates, partners or parent company. These companies and individuals may have access to your personal information to perform their business functions on our behalf as well as their own business purposes such as assisting us in administering various promotions and providing specific promotional offers to you. Roundy's will provide those other companies with the information they need to perform the services and, except in the case of contests and promotions administered by outside companies, we prohibit them from using the information for other purposes. We do not control how other companies use the information you may provide directly to them (such as pursuant to a contest registration) and recommend that you check the privacy statement of the company requesting information for a description of their data collection practices. Please be aware that subsidiaries and affiliates of Roundy's are not outside parties or outside companies, and we may periodically share personal information or aggregated information with Roundy's subsidiaries and affiliates.

**Security Measures

**Children's Privacy  
**Roundy's Sites do not collect or maintain information at our Sites from those we actually know are under the age of 13. From time to time, we may display information that is specifically aimed at children, for example coloring pages. However, registration is never required to access these pages, and we do not collect personal information in connection with these activities.

**Wireless Marketing Services  
**Roundy’s may invite you to register to receive alerts, promotions, services, news, and other information (each a "Wireless Marketing Service") via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones. Such Wireless Marketing Services are provided by Roundy’s and/or its contractors or vendors for Roundy’s. Wireless Marketing Services are limited to adult subscribers who reside in the United States and are void where prohibited.

If you wish to receive a Wireless Marketing Service, you must expressly consent to receive that Wireless Marketing Service from Roundy’s.

_Availability._ In order to receive Wireless Marketing Services, you generally must have a text messaging service plan from a participating wireless service provider. Our Wireless Marketing Services may not be available in all geographic areas or work on all mobile or wireless devices. Mobile devices that can receive text messages (SMS Service) are generally able to receive text alerts. You agree that Roundy’s will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any Wireless Marketing Services or related messages, as delivery depends on the effective transmission from your carrier or network operator. Please contact your wireless provider if you have questions regarding your SMS service.

_Personal Information._ The personal information requested as part of the registration process may include a user's telephone number, a wireless email address or the carrier's name. Additional information may be requested for specific Wireless Marketing Services, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, or other similar information. Subject to applicable law, we may use this personal Information in accordance with our Online Privacy Statement.

_Security/Delivery._ You should keep in mind that most wireless transmissions are not secured. There is a greater risk that an unauthorized third party may intercept your messages or your personal information when you use a wireless communications device. Therefore, if you choose to sign up for any Wireless Marketing Services, you agree that Roundy’s will not be liable to you for damages caused by a third party's interception of such items.

_Potential Charges._ Roundy’s does not charge users for its Wireless Marketing Services. However, your carrier's standard message and data rates may apply. Charges may show up on your mobile bill or may be deducted from your prepaid account. By registering to receive Wireless Marketing Services, you agree that you may be charged by your wireless carrier for any messages that you send to or receive from Roundy’s and that you are solely responsible for such charges. Under no circumstances will Roundy’s be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges, whether incurred by you directly or as a result of the activity of another person with access, whether or not authorized, to your wireless device, telephone number, or email address. Please contact your wireless carrier if you have any questions about your wireless service.
