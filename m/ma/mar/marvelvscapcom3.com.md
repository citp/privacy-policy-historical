**CAPCOM USA ONLINE PRIVACY STATEMENT**

Last updated November 11, 2008

Welcome to Capcom USA!

**OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT**

Capcom U.S.A., Inc., Capcom Entertainment, Inc. and Capcom Studio 8, Inc. (collectively, "Capcom USA" or "Capcom") respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognizes the importance of protecting all information that you may choose to share with us. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.

This certification seal shown on this page confirms that Capcom USA is a member in good standing of [ESRB's Privacy Online Program](http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp). ESRB's Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that our website's information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, ESRB independently audits our websites, and administers other enforcement and accountability mechanisms.

**What information does this Privacy Statement cover?**

This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected on the websites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and does not apply to any other information collected by Capcom USA through any other means.

This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of personal information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted.

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Capcom USA offline. This Privacy Policy applies only to websites maintained by Capcom USA, and not to Capcom Interactive, Inc. (www.capcommobile.com), or to our international affiliates (Capcom Asia, Capcom Europe, Capcom Japan), or any websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. Capcom USA is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on those websites.

Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws. 

**What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?**

We don't require personal information to access our website. But if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our website. Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you.

**Children**

We don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. We take kids privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times.

**Information You Provide to Us**

All of the personal information we receive comes directly from our guests. To offer our guests certain features on our website, we collect several types of personal information. We collect personal information from our guests to:

>   1. Register for our website
>   
> 
>   2. Register for community forum
>   
> 
>   3. Register for our newsletter
>   
> 
>   4. Use "Tell-a-Friend" features
>   
> 
>   5. Purchase a product at one of our online stores
>   
> 
>   6. Participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions
>   
> 
>   7. Receive customer or technical support
>   8. Participate in Online Surveys, Polls or Questionnaires
>   9. Product Registration

Typically, this information includes:

>   1. name
>   
> 
>   2. e-mail address
>   
> 
>   3. telephone and fax number
>   
> 
>   4. shipping and billing address, and
>   
> 
>   5. for those purchasing products online, credit card information.
>   
>  


Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date of birth, gender, hobbies, occupation, marital status, platform preferences, and other game ownership information. This demographic information may be associated with your personal information.

**Information Collected Through Technology**

We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites.

**Cookies**

Our websites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For example, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement or a third party and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser/third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website. 

**How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?**

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.

**Capcom USA Activities and Updates**

Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide services like newsletter subscription, updates on special events, game news, and e-mail announcements of interest to our users. Moreover, if you register for access to our blogs or message boards, we will use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards. You should understand, however, that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community. So whenever you give out personal information in public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.

**Operational Uses**

We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites.

We occasionally employ other companies to perform services necessary to our internal operations. For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our web pages, process credit card transactions, analyze customers' interaction with our website, and process consumer surveys. We also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes. While providing their services, these companies may access your personally identifying information. These companies have agreed to securely store and maintain the personal information received from us.

**Aggregate Information**

Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable. We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. Given the non-personal nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to de-personalize your personal information. We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties without your consent.

**Business Information**

For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity. Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.

**Purchase or Sale of Businesses**

From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same way required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.

**Third Party Use**

Our company doesn't share and hasn't reserved the right to share personal or demographic information with third parties.

**Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others**

We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law (e.g., court order or subpoena) or help enforce:

>   * our Terms of Use, contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game rules;
>   
> 
>   * protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of your property; or
>   
> 
>   * protect the safety and security of our websites or third parties.
>   
>  


**What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?**

Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. For inquiries regarding our disclosure policy, please write us:

**What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?**

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. That's why we have technical, administrative, and physical security measures in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. We also review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods. But, despite our best efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. 

Specific security measures we currently implement to prevent unauthorized physical or electronic access to web users' personal and demographic information: 

  * Web user data is stored behind a firewall
  * Data is stored in a secure physical environment (e.g. behind locked doors)
  * Data is stored in a database accessible to authorized employees on a need-to-know basis only
  * Users or employees must have a unique password before gaining access to user data
  * We use standard encryption technology when transferring or receiving sensitive personal information like credit card numbers
  * We maintain written security policies to which all employees must adhere.

**How can you update your personal information and profile?**

You can access and update the contact information you gave us during registration (that is, your e-mail address or any other information that would directly enable us to contact you), by e-mailing us at [accounts@capcom.com](mailto:accounts@capcom.com). 

**How can you ask questions, or send us comments, about this Privacy Policy?**
