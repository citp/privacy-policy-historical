The transfer of personal information is communicated via state-of-the-art encryption. Our secure Website server and database reside behind a firewall in a secure datacenter with fault tolerance and fire protection.

In light of the inherent vulnerability, you acknowledge that: (a) there exists security and privacy limitations which are beyond our control; (b) there can be no guaranty of the security, integrity and privacy limitations related to information transmitted to us over the internet or through our website; and/or (c) outside interference through piracy cannot be controlled by us and as such, information and data transmitted may be viewed by unauthorized third parties.

**Cookies**  
We use cookie technology to help members move faster through the site and to keep track of your shopping cart. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. A cookie is a small file sent to your computer by our site server. The most commonly employed cookies on our site server are those that help us establish (1) whether you are a registered member of our site, and (2) whether a registered member has opted to use the “auto-login” feature, which eliminates the requirement for registered members to identify themselves each time they visit our site. A separate cookie from the company that handles our advertising production and tracking system helps identify which ad you may be clicking on, so that you will be linked to the correct site. We may also use cookie technology to track the site’s aggregate page views, which helps us determine which features the user base seems to be most or least interested in. Please note that cookies cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, cannot destroy files, and cannot send you viruses.

Each time your visit our website our servers automatically record your activity and information such as your IP address and/or the domain from which you are visiting. We also record which links on our webpage you click on or visit and any search terms you use. We use this data for website maintenance and technical administration. Your IP address is never linked with any personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in the case of our investigation into a violation of the terms of use or alleged misconduct.

**Links to Other Websites**  
This site may contain links to third parties’ websites. Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, or disclosure of data and information by such third parties. If you provide information on third party sites, the privacy policy and terms of service on those sites are applicable. Especially if the third party site is used in connection with a purchase of a product. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of websites that you visit before submitting personal information.

**Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy**
