### Cookies

We use cookie technology to help members move faster through the site and to keep track of your shopping cart. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. A cookie is a small file sent to your computer by our site server. The most commonly employed cookies on our site server are those that help us establish (1) whether you are a registered member of our site, and (2) whether a registered member has opted to use the “auto-login” feature, which eliminates the requirement for registered members to identify themselves each time they visit our site. A separate cookie from the company that handles our advertising production and tracking system helps identify which ad you may be clicking on, so that you will be linked to the correct site. We may also use cookie technology to track the site’s aggregate page views, which helps us determine which features the user base seems to be most or least interested in. Please note that cookies cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, cannot destroy files, and cannot send you viruses.

  


### Links to Other Websites

This site may contain links to third parties’ websites. Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, or disclosure of data and information by such third parties. If you provide information on third party sites, the privacy policy and terms of service on those sites are applicable. Especially if the third party site is used in connection with a purchase of a product. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of websites that you visit before submitting personal information.

  


### Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of thirteen (13).
