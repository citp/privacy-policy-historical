We may collect and use your IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the services on our Website.

### How We Use Information

We use customer contact information to send you our weekly and monthly newsletters, information about our company, and promotional material for our products. We will also use your contact information to contact you when necessary.

  


### Sharing Information with Our Affiliates

We may share personal information described above with our affiliates for business purposes, such as, but not limited to, servicing customers and informing customers about new products and services, and as permitted by applicable law. Our affiliates may include companies controlled or owned by us as well as companies that have an ownership interest in our company. The information we share with affiliates may include any of the information described above, such as your name, address, and email address. Our affiliates maintain the privacy of your information to the same extent MTI does in accordance with this Policy.

  


### Sharing Information with Third Parties

Information may be shared with third parties that perform support services for your interest in MTI and assist us in maintaining our books and records. This includes non-affiliates that provide professional, legal, or accounting advice to us. Non-affiliated companies that assist us in providing services to you are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information to the extent they receive it and to use your personal information only in the course of providing such services, as directed by MTI.   
As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or reorganize our business or assets. In the event of a merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of assets, MTI may, in its sole and absolute discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected, including without limitation, non-personal information and personal information, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.

  


### Public Forums

This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

  


### Our Commitment to Security and Confidentiality

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. The transfer of personal information is communicated via state-of-the-art encryption. Our secure Website server and database reside behind a firewall in a secure datacenter with fault tolerance and fire protection.

  


### Cookies

We use cookie technology to help members move faster through the site and to keep track of your shopping cart. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. A cookie is a small file sent to your computer by our site server. The most commonly employed cookies on our site server are those that help us establish (1) whether you are a registered member of our site, and (2) whether a registered member has opted to use the “auto-login” feature, which eliminates the requirement for registered members to identify themselves each time they visit our site. A separate cookie from the company that handles our advertising production and tracking system helps identify which ad you may be clicking on, so that you will be linked to the correct site. We may also use cookie technology to track the site’s aggregate page views, which helps us determine which features the user base seems to be most or least interested in. Please note that we do not track your individual usage patterns using cookies, nor do we use them to track your financial holdings or other personal preferences in any individually identified way. Contrary to what you might have heard from other sources, cookies cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, cannot destroy files, and cannot send you viruses.

  


### Links to Other Websites

This site may contain links to third parties’ websites. Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, or disclosure of data and information by such third parties. If you provide information on third party sites, the privacy policy and terms of service on those sites are applicable. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of websites that you visit before submitting personal information.

  


### Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of thirteen (13).

  


### Opt-Out

If you do not wish to have your personal information disclosed to our affiliates or other third parties as described in this Policy please contact us via e-mail at: [compliance@markettraders.com](mailto:compliance@markettraders.com).
