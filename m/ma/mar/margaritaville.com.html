<h1>Privacy<em> Policy</em></h1>
<p>Margaritaville uses its best efforts to respect the privacy and safety of its online visitors. Margaritaville has developed this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to this website (located at the URL www.margaritaville.com) and all other web pages interconnected with such website including, without limitation, the home page, splash page, and all other pages under the same top level domain name, and all content thereon (collectively, the "Site").</p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (or Personal Information) is information that can be used to identify or contact you. This Site will not collect personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily submit or email such information. In certain instances, this Site may request and collect certain personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number and e-mail address through various means, such as Site registration, surveys, games, questions, comments and communications to the Site, and postings to chat and bulletin areas, if any. For online orders, this Site will request contact information (including name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number). This information is used for billing information and to fill customer’s orders. To be absolutely clear, this Site will not obtain personally identifiable information about you other than that which you choose to provide, and, except as provided herein, we will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone outside Margaritaville.</p>

<h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p>We may also collect anonymous, non-personal information about you and your use of our Site or your use of emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send to you. For example, we collect non-personal information about your use of our Site through the use of Cookies. Cookies are small computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive that allow us to know how often someone visits this Site and the activities they conduct while on this Site (such as the chatrooms you visited, whether you submitted orders for products, etc.). Every computer is assigned a different cookie by us. You may, however, disallow receiving cookies at any time through your web browser. Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookie, certain of the functions and conveniences of our Site may not work properly but you do not have to accept our cookie in order to productively use our Site. We may also collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server and to otherwise administer our Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. This information does not contain any personally identifiable information about you. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data. </p>

<h4>Sharing</h4>
<p>From time to time, we may share our user's contact information with our partners, affiliates or advertisers. We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third parties to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p> 

<h4>Tell-A-Friend</h4>
<p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about this Site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Margaritaville will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. Margaritaville stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Margaritaville at webmaster@margaritaville.com to request the removal of this information from their database.</p>

<h4>Links</h4>
<p>This Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Margaritaville is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>We take security very seriously. We use commercially reasonable efforts to provide for the secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers by using encryption software. However, due to the open communication nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and us, and us and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. </p> 

<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p>

<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p> 

<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@margaritaville.com">webmaster@margaritaville.com</a>.</p>

<h4>Supplementation of Information</h4>
<p>To enhance this Site’s ability to tailor its functions to an individual's preference, we may combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase the companies collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the Site to our users' preferences. </p> 

<h4>Special Offers</h4>
<p>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter from Margaritaville or our partners, affiliates, or advertisers. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.</p>

<h4>Site and Service Updates</h4>
<p>We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. </p> 

<h4>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h4>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support. [Some pages of this Site may also provide telephone or postal mail options for updating or correcting personal information].</p> 

<h4>Protecting Children</h4>
<p>Margaritaville takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. Our Site is a general audience site. We do not permit anyone under the age of 13 to register with us. We also do not send email correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.</p> 

<h4>Choice/Opt-out </h4>
<p>Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.</p>

<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our e-mail newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out simply by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the e-mail. You may also unsubscribe at any time by e-mailing webmaster@margaritaville.com. Type UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line. We will update your records as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from your request.</p>

<h4>Your Acceptance of this Policy</h4>
<p>By using this Site, you signify your acceptance without modification of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time so visitors are encouraged to review this policy from time to time. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Privacy Policy and additional terms posted on this Site. Your continued use of our Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your agreement to such changes. </p>
