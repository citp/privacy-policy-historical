<h1>Legal Notices</h1>
<div class="block first">
 <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

				<p>Marketo, Inc. ("Marketo" or "We") knows that you care about
				how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy
				seriously.&nbsp; Marketo has created this
				privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment
				to your privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. </p>
				
				<p>By accessing the Marketo website at <a href="http://www.marketo.com/">www.marketo.com</a>, including all related
				pages ("Site"), including any subscription based features or services offered by
				Marketo through the Site or through app.marketo.com (collectively, the "Service"),
				you are accepting the practices outlined in this Statement. </p>
                </div>
 <div class="block">
				<h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
				
				<p>This Statement covers Marketo’s collection of personal information
				that Marketo gathers when you are on the Site and when you use the Service.</p>
				
				<p>This Statement does not apply to the practices of third
				parties that Marketo does not own or control, or to individuals that Marketo
				does not employ or manage. For avoidance
				of doubt, this Statement does not apply to any third party information gathered
				by Marketo’s subscribers when they use the Service. It only applies to information gathered by
				Marketo to provide the Service to its subscribers. </p>
				
				<h3>What Personal Information About Customers Does Marketo Collect?</h3>
				
				<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you
				with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information
				from our customers:</p>
				
				<h4>Information You Provide to Us: </h4>
				
				<p>Marketo collects identifying information when you use the Service,
				when you visit the Site (including, without limitation, any marketo.com web
				pages or landing pages), and when you enter promotions or contests. For example, we require customers who
				register to use the Service to give us the following personal information: their
				name, Company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial
				qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit
				card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be
				using the Service.&nbsp; When you initially express
				interest obtaining additional information about the Service, or when you
				register for the Service, we may also ask for additional types personal
				information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company
				information, such as annual revenues or marketing spend. We may also request
				demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a
				more personalized experience or verify your passwords.</p>
				
				<p>All financial and billing information that we collect from
				you is used for the purposes of checking your qualifications as a prospective
				customer and billing you for the Service. Such billing information is not used
				by Marketo for marketing or promotional purposes. Marketo may use a third-party
				intermediary to manage the credit card and billing processing. This
				intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted
				to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose
				of credit card and billing processing. </p>
				
				<p>Customers of the Service will be using the Service to host and
				submit data and information relevant to their advertising campaigns and other
				promotional activities ("Customer Data"). Marketo will not review,
				share, distribute, print, or reference any such Customer Data except as
				provided for in the Service Agreement or as may be required by law. Notwithstanding
				the foregoing, Customer Data may at times be viewed or accessed by Marketo for
				the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or for investigating a suspected
				violation of the Service Agreement, or as may be required by law.</p>
				
				
				
				<h4>Automatic Information:</h4>
				
				<ul><li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever
				you interact with us via our website. Marketo
				automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our
				server logs including your IP address, Marketo cookie information, the page you
				requested, and your communications and interactions with other site registrants. Marketo uses this traffic data to help
				diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Service. </li>
				
				<li>We automatically collect usage information, such as the
				numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and use of components of our
				Service. We may use this information to
				provide research, advice and information, including, without limitation, for benchmarking
				purposes (e.g. we may publish an industry white paper that uses data collected
				through the use of our Service). This
				data is only used in the aggregate. This
				type of collective data also enables us to figure out how often customers use
				parts of the Service so we can make the Service appealing to as many customers
				as possible. In addition, we may provide
				statistical information to our partners about how our customers, collectively,
				use our Site and Service. We may share
				this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often
				people use areas of our Site and our Service, so that they, too, may provide
				you with an optimal experience. </li>
				
				<li>We also collect and use information for internal
				purposes. For example, if you are a
				registered user of the Marketo’s subscription-based Service, we may keep
				records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users
				online behavior, and any reported violation of our Service Agreement that you
				or someone on your account may have committed. </li>
				
				<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web
				sites anonymously. While Marketo will
				not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot
				recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li></ul>
				
				
				<h4>E-mail Communications:</h4>
				
				<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Marketo
				if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make
				e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out emails with
				information regarding Marketo or our partners including promotions and events. Customers can opt out of being contacted by
				us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@marketo.com?subject=Email Opt-Out">support@marketo.com</a>.</p>
				
				<p>If a user elects to use our referral features for informing
				a friend about our Site or Service, we ask them for the friend's name and email
				address. Marketo will automatically send the friend an email on behalf of the
				user who made the referral, inviting such friend to visit the Site and try the
				Service. Marketo does not store this
				information.</p>
				
				<h4>Information From Other Sources:</h4>
				
				<p>For purposes such as improving personalization of our Service,
				we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our
				account information.</p>
				
				<h3>What about Cookies?</h3>
				
				<ul><li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to
				your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to
				recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited
				and by how many people. Marketo employs
				cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user.
				The cookies placed by the Marketo server are readable only by Marketo, and
				cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. </li>
				
				<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of
				browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new
				cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie,
				or how to fully disable cookies. We
				strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because
				cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Marketo’s most attractive
				features.</li></ul>
				
				
				
				<h3>Will Marketo Share Any of the Information it Receives?</h3>
				
				<p>Information about our customers is an integral part of our
				business. We neither rent nor sell your
				personal information to anyone. We share
				your personal information only with entities that are controlled or controlled
				by or under common control of Marketo and as described below:</p>
				
				<h4>Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:</h4>
				
				<p>We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work
				closely with them. In certain
				situations, these businesses operate within the Service or through the Site.&nbsp; In other situations, Marketo provides other services,
				or sells products or services jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated
				business is associated with your transaction, and we will share customer
				information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Agents:</h4>
				
				<p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our
				behalf and may need to share your information with them to provide products or
				services to you. Examples may include
				fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail,
				removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing
				marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer
				service. We may also provide your
				personal information to agents who will use it to verify aggregate usage data
				that we provide to our partners. </p>
				
				<h4>Promotional Offers:</h4>
				
				<p>We may send offers to certain customers on behalf of other
				businesses. However, when we do so, we
				do not give the other business your name and address. If you are a registered user of the Marketo’s
				subscription-based Service and do not wish to receive these offers, please send
				an email to <a href="mailto:support@marketo.com?subject=Promotional Offer Opt-Out">support@marketo.com</a>.</p>
				
				<h4>Business Transfers:</h4>
				
				<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets or
				businesses. In these types of
				transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that
				are transferred. Moreover, if Marketo,
				or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer information would
				be one of the assets that are transferred.</p>
				
				<h4>Protection of Marketo and Others:</h4>
				
				<p>We may release personal information when we believe in good
				faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our
				conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or
				safety of Marketo, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with
				other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
				reduction.</p>
				
				<h4>With Your Consent:</h4>
				
				<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your
				personal information may be shared with third parties.</p>
				
				<h3>Is Information About Me Secure?</h3>
				
				<ul><li>Your Marketo Account Information is protected by a password
				for your privacy and security. You need
				to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
				computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.</li>
				
				<li>Only employees who need personal information to perform a
				specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted
				access to it. All of our employees are
				kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</li></ul>
				
				
				
				<h3>What Information Can I Access?</h3>
				
				<p>You can access your personal information as part of our
				Service and correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate.</p>
				
				<h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
				
				<ul><li>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose
				information, even though it may be needed to make a purchase or take advantage
				of certain Marketo features.</li>
				
				<li>You are able to add or update certain information on pages,
				such as those listed in the "What Information Do I Have" section above. When you update information, however, we may
				maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.</li>
				
				<li>If you are a registered user of Marketo’s subscription-based
				Service, you may request deletion of your Marketo account by logging in to your
				account and selecting the "delete account" option. Please note that some information may remain
				in our records after deletion of your account.</li>
				
				<li>If you are a registered user of Marketo’s subscription-based
				Service and do not wish to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please make
				sure you have unselected this option in your user account settings. Please note that if you do not want to
				receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices
				will still govern your use of the Marketo web site, and you are responsible for
				reviewing such legal notices for changes.</li>
				
				<li>As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on
				the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from
				accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive
				a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if
				you do not enable cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of
				our attractive features.</li></ul>
				
				<h3>Can Children Use Marketo’s services?</h3>
				
				<p>Our site and the use of services made available through Marketo
				are not intended for children under the age of 13. Marketo does not knowingly or specifically
				collect information about children under the age of 13 and believes that
				children of any age should get their parents’ consent before giving out any
				personal information. We encourage you
				to participate in your child’s web experience. Marketo recommends that parents use Web filtering technology to
				supervise their kids’ access to the Web.</p>

				<p>If you decide to visit the Marketo Site, your visit and any
				possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms
				of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
				application of California law.
				
				
				</p>
				
				<h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
				
				<p>The Service may permit you to link to other websites on the
				Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Marketo site. These other websites are not under Marketo
				control, and such links do not constitute an endorsement by Marketo of those other
				websites or the services offered through them. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Marketo
				site are not covered by this Privacy Statement, and Marketo is not responsible
				for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.</p>
				
				<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
				
				<p>Marketo may amend this Privacy Policy. Use of information we collect now is subject
				to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to our privacy policy, we
				will notify you by posting the revised notice on our Site or sending you an
				email so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and
				under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>
				
				<h3>Questions or Concerns</h3>
				
				<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at Marketo
				site, please email <a href="mailto:support@marketo.com?subject=Privacy Question">support@marketo.com</a>. Your
