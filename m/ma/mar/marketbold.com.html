<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience  on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you  to use the Internet’s vast array of information, tools, and  opportunities with complete confidence.</p>
<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm  commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how  our company collects information from all end users of our Internet  services (the “Services”)-those who access some of our Services but do  not have accounts (“Visitors”) as well as those who may purchase  Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service  (“Members”)-what we do with the information we collect, and the choices  Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such  information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</strong></p>
<p>Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from  Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and  the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this  information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our  Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information with  third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected  if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special  circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required  by law or other special cases described below.</p>
<p>Registration:&nbsp; Members may be asked to provide certain personal  information when they sign up for our Products or Services including  name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit  card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the  Services. The personal information collected from Members during the  registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (such as  for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third  parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special  circumstances.</p>
<p>However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote  our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information,  such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the  Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of  allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion.</p>
<p>In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner  for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and  aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during  registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members).  As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and  non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the  Services.</p>
<p>Our Company Partners and Sponsors:&nbsp; Some products and services may be  offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate,  independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide  Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner  may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these  instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or  transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or  feature.</p>
<p>Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web  Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor  seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share non-identifying  and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal  information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded  products or services offered.</p>
<p>Online Shopping:&nbsp; At some Web sites, you can purchase products and  services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog  or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to  provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address,  phone number, and credit/debit card information.</p>
<p>If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift  order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide  information about the recipient, such as the recipient’s name, address,  and phone number. Our company has no control over the third parties’ use  of any personal information you provide when placing such an order.  Please exercise care when doing so.</p>
<p>If you order services or products directly from our company we will  use the personal information you provide only to process that order. We  do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent  necessary to complete that order.</p>
<p>Online Advertisements:&nbsp; Our company may display our online  advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying  information about our Visitors and Members collected through the  registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions  with these advertisers.</p>
<p>Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and  non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint  ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us  the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement  tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying  information we have collected, we may then display or send the  advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does not share  personal information about its Visitors or Members with these  advertisers or joint venture companies.</p>
<p>Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email  inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the  email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email  address for any other purpose and does not share the return email  address with any third party.</p>
<p>Voluntary Customer Surveys:&nbsp; We may periodically conduct both  business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to  participate in these surveys because they provide us with important  information that helps us to improve the types of products and services  we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and  responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is  conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is  voluntary.</p>
<p>We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to  our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses  of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to  the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies,  education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic  information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the  quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and  products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be  shared with third parties.</p>
<p>Promotions:&nbsp; Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes,  drawings, games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored by or  cobranded with third parties. In certain instances, company may have to  supply personally identifiable information of the winners to the third  parties. Our company has no control over third parties’ use of this  information.</p>
<p>You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion,  simply by making a purchase from us or by providing us with personally  identifiable information for some other reason or purpose. When the  winning entries are chosen, only the names and personally identifiable  information of the winners are shared with the entity administering the  sweepstakes or contest, so that they can notify the winners.</p>
<p>Special Cases:&nbsp; It is our company’s policy not to use or share the  personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the  ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt  out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
<p>However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or  Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites  accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole  discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit  agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law  enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications  Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental  or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is  necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone  who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or  other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our  company and our Members.</p>
