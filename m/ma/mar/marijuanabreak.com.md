Last updated Jan 02, 2019.

The website located at www.MarijuanaBreak.com, its sub-domains, and certain affiliated websites (the “Site”) is a collection of various intellectual properties that belong to Yoad Development and Technology 2014 LTD, and its agents, employees, contractors, affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company, and other related companies (“MarijuanaBreak”, “Us”, “Our”, and “We”). This MarijuanaBreak Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the information we gather from you when you use the Site, and related services (together, the “Services”) and how we use, process, and disclose that information. We may add to this Policy with other notices. We may also post additional privacy statements for some portions of the Services. By submitting personal information through our Services, you expressly consent to the transfer of your personal data to our servers in the United States for our collection, use, and disclosure in accordance with this Policy.

**International Privacy Laws**

If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that you are sending information to the United States where our servers are located. That information may then be transferred within the United States or back out of the United States to other countries outside of your country of residence, depending on the type of information and how it is stored by us. These countries (including the United States) may not necessarily have the data protection laws as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of residence; however, our collection, storage, and use of your information will at all times be governed by this Privacy Policy.

We permit advertisements to be delivered to you by third-party Internet advertising companies (also called ad networks or network advertisers). These companies may use cookies, Web beacons, platform device identifiers, software agents, and other technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits over time on our Service and across other websites to deliver advertisements to you targeted to your interests, measure their effectiveness and personalize advertising content, and to understand the usage and visitation of the Services and the other applications and websites tracked by these advertising companies. We do not have access to or control over cookies, Web beacons, platform device identifiers, software agents, or other technologies that they may use. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party advertisers.

**Data Security and Transfer**

Your personal data is stored on servers of companies we hire to provide services to us. We take reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to help protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of your personal data. However, no company can fully prevent security risks. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. To help protect yourself and your information, choose a unique password for our Services and do not use a password on our Services that you would use on any other website or online service.

However, while we and others give you choices as described in this policy, there are many ways in which Web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and our Site may not be aware of or honor every mechanism.
