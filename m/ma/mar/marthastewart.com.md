# Privacy Policy | Martha Stewart

Our privacy policy will change on July 1st, 2015. To see new policy click [here](http://www.meredith.com/policyMSO.html).

**Privacy Policy**

Last Updated **AUGUST 11, 2014**

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes your privacy rights in connection with information collected, used, stored, or shared by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. ("MSO," "us," "our," or "we") and our related sites, applications, services, and/or tools, whether accessed via Internet, mobile, or other device or through applications and sites affiliated with MSO products (collectively, the “Online Services”). By using the Online Services or registering for an account, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this Policy.

**What types of information do we collect?**

MSO collects two types of information about users of Online Services: (1) Personally Identifiable Information and (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

“Personally Identifiable Information” is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, including, but not limited to, name, postal address, telephone number, or email address. Personally Identifiable Information is collected in the following ways.

          **1\. Membership Registration**

You may choose to register as a member of our websites (“Member”). By becoming a Member you may participate in certain activities on our websites and enjoy special benefits offered only to Members. To become a Member, you are required to sign in by providing your name and email address. You will also be asked to create a password. 

Alternatively, you may register to become a Member using one of your existing social media accounts, such as Facebook or Twitter. If you become a Member using your existing social media account, your social media provider may provide us with access to any Personally Identifiable Information on file with that social media provider and associated with your account in accordance with the provider’s terms and conditions. We may use any Personally Identifiable Information collected through these social media accounts in the same manner we use any Personally Identifiable Information that you provide directly to us. Upon registering with your existing social media account, if you elect to share information you provide to us with the social media provider, we will share information with it in accordance with your election. The terms and conditions of the social media provider will apply to the information we disclose to it.

          **2\. Sweepstakes, Surveys, and Other Promotions**

You may be asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information in connection with sweepstakes, contests, raffles, games, and similar promotions held on our Online Services, as well as in connection with completing surveys and other similar activities on our websites.

          **3\. Product Purchases**

We may offer the ability to purchase certain goods, merchandise, or services through our Online Services. In connection with these purchases, you may be asked to provide your shipping and/or delivery (if different from the postal address) addresses, telephone number, and credit card information.

          **4\. Interactive Services**

Members may also participate in interactive services provided through our Online Services, which allow Members to share comments, ideas, and thoughts about various topics. “Interactive Services” are any actions you take using our Online Services that are viewable to other Members and visitors. These actions include, but are not limited to, creating a user profile, commenting, rating, personalizing URLs, and participating in Q&A Hours. Use of any Interactive Service is governed by our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use). Users of these services should be mindful that any information they post or disclose will become public information and will be available to other participating Members, users, and visitors of our Online Services. Accordingly, if you choose to participate in any Interactive Services, please use discretion. MSO is not responsible for any information, personal or otherwise, that you submit through these services and does not have any responsibility to publish, take down, remove, or edit any of your information or activities or any of your submissions that are made public through your use of the Interactive Services.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

“Non-Personally Identifiable Information” is information that does not reveal your identity but may be used by us and shared with third parties. It includes information such as “Aggregate Information” and technical data. Described below are types of Non-Personally Identifiable Information and the technologies used to collect such information.

          **1\. Aggregate Information**

We constantly seek to make improvements to our Online Services. As part of these efforts, we collect and analyze certain "Aggregate Information" about how visitors use our websites. Aggregate Information is any information that does not allow us to identify a specific individual and includes data such as demographic information, purchase categories (e.g., home furnishings), or the particular browser a visitor uses.

If you become a Member via an existing social media account, such as Facebook or Twitter, we may collect and use various types of Aggregate Information, technical data, and other profile information affiliated with your social media account and on file with that social media provider.

Please note that certain Aggregate Information may be linked with Personally Identifiable Information. Any such linked information will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes of this Policy for as long as it is so linked.

          **2\. Cookies and Other Technologies**

To enhance your experience we also use "cookies" and other technologies in our Online Services. Cookies are small data files that our server places on a visitor's computer hard drive or device to store your preferences and to help us understand how visitors are using our Online Services. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering with one of our Online Services. Once you choose to provide us with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on our Online Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our websites, to save your password in password-protected areas, to enable shopping carts, or to tailor content or product and service offerings). 

Further, cookies and other technologies are used in email messages sent by our email delivery and marketing company and on our websites to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Online Services. With respect to ads, information about your visits to our Online Services, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. However, you may find that some parts of our websites will not function properly if you have refused cookies or similar tracking technologies and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar tracking technologies might prevent you from accessing some of our content and hamper your viewing of editorial content. For more information about how to "opt-out" of these ad cookies, please click here. Cookies must be enabled in order to register with our Online Services.

          **3\. Analytics Technologies**

When you visit our websites, we may collect various types of technical data. This data includes, but is not limited to, domain and/or Web browser information. We may track which website you visited before arriving at our websites and the website you link to when you leave our websites. We may also keep a record of which pages of our websites you visit, and how long you spend on each page.

We also use tools called “Google Analytics” and “Remarketing with Google Analytics” to collect information about use of our websites. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our websites, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our websites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our websites and to provide current traffic statistics for our websites to third party advertisers and other affiliates. 

We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to display content specific advertisements to visitors that have previously visited our websites when those visitors go to other websites that have the Google Display Network implemented. We and other third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on a visitor’s past visits to our site. 

Google Analytics and Remarketing with Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our websites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics or Remarketing with Google Analytics with Personally Identifiable Information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our websites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of service, available at <http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html>, and the Google Privacy Policy, available at <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/>. You can visit <http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/> to opt out of Google’s advertising tracking cookie or download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking software.

**What does MSO do with the information it gathers and/or tracks?**

          **1\. Providing You with Online Services**

We may use Personally Identifiable Information to enable you to use our Online Services; to communicate with you regarding products and services offered by MSO and our affiliates and partners and other topics we think you might find of interest; to conduct of sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions; and to process e-commerce transactions.

          **2\. Customizing and Enhancing Your Experience**

We collect and use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance your use of our Online Services and to deliver more individualized content and advertising. We use both Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information to improve the performance of our Online Services; to customize the content and layout of our site pages; and to inform you of new areas of our websites and product specials.

          **3\. Statistical Analysis**

We may collect and analyze Aggregate Information to determine how many visitors arrived at certain pages of our site, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went afterwards. This information allows us to determine which pages might be the most interesting to our visitors and enables us to provide them with a better and richer experience on our site by informing advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base and improving customer relations. 

          **4\. Third Parties**

Occasionally, we share Aggregate Information with third parties, such as our advertisers and business partners, for marketing, statistical analysis and promotional purposes. 

We may supplement Aggregate Information with similar information obtained from our affiliates, companies with whom we have marketing or other business relationships, and other third party sources, such as your linked social media provider. For more information on how and why MSO may share your information with third parties, please see “Does MSO share information with other companies?”

**Does MSO share information with other companies?**

We take the privacy of our users and customers seriously. MSO occasionally shares both Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information with other companies, including MSO businesses, MSO subsidiaries, and third parties with whom MSO has a marketing or business relationship. Additionally, in some instances, other companies may be collecting your information on their own accord. Information is transferred to other companies for the following purposes.

          **1\. Activities and Services Provided by Third Parties**

We employ third party companies to provide certain activities and services available through our Online Services on our behalf. We may share relevant Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for the purpose of enabling them to perform such activities or services. For example, if you choose to purchase a product from us, we may use outside vendors to process your credit card, or to process and ship the order to you. In these instances, we would need to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your credit card information and shipping address, to these vendors. These providers have access to personal information, but are restricted from using it for their own marketing purposes.

We use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Certain Personally Identifiable Information, including your email address, is provided to the email delivery and marketing company.

If you submit information to our website, our third party service provider, Mollom BVBA, may collect, analyze, and store information about you and the content you submit for anti-spam and quality monitoring purposes as set forth in Mollom’s privacy policy available at <http://mollom.com/web-service-privacy-policy>.

          **2\. Sweepstakes and Other Promotions**

If you choose to participate in a sweepstakes, contest, raffle, game, or other similar promotion, we reserve the right to share any related Personally Identifiable Information with third party sponsors of such sweepstakes, contest, raffle, game, or promotion (irrespective of whether it is hosted by us). You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest, raffle, game and promotion in which you participate through our Online Services, as they may contain additional important information about MSO's or a sponsor's use of your Personally Identifiable Information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your Personally Identifiable Information conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.

          **3\. Business Partners**

Certain portions of our websites, or websites which our Online Services may link to if you decide to purchase a product or service, are operated by business partners with whom we may offer products or services. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because its name will appear either with ours or separately. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your Personally Identifiable Information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third party business partners and are not responsible or liable for any third party business partner’s disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information.

          **4\. Third Party Cookies and Other Technologies**

In addition, we may allow third party service providers such as advertisers, website statistics gatherers, and others to use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, serve advertisements, collect statistics about use of our Online Services, and enable them to record information such as your browser type, IP address, which ads your browser has seen, which site pages you may have been viewing when ads were delivered, your referring URL, your geographic location, and other interaction information (but not your name or address). MSO does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

          **5\. Legal Reasons**

We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to: comply with applicable laws; respond to governmental inquiries or requests; comply with valid legal process; protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of MSO; to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use).

          **6\. Mergers or Other Types Corporate Transfers**

Should MSO undergo a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization, or liquidation, MSO’s accumulated customer information will be treated as an asset and, like other business assets, will be subject to transfer to or acquisition by a third party.

**If I link to another website and provide information to that website, how will that information be handled?**

Our Online Services contain links to third party websites, including, but not limited to, the websites of companies with whom we have business or marketing relationships. If you link to a third party website, you will leave our websites and this Policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those other websites. Any information you provide on these third party websites will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these third party websites, including their privacy policies. We shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, such third party websites. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY APPLIES SOLELY TO INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MSO.

**How does MSO protect my information?**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have taken appropriate precautions to safeguard any information we collect and/or store on our servers through a visitor’s use of our Online Services, including Secured Socket Layers (SSL) and other encryption technology. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to Personally Identifiable Information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors of data. 

If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of either your account or your linked social media account has been compromised) you must immediately notify us of the problem by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us-form).

**What are my "opt-out" choices?**

You may choose not to receive promotional emails or electronic newsletters from us by: (A) following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the specific email from which you wish to opt-out; (B) visiting the [“Account Settings”](https://my.marthastewart.com/sign-in) section of the Site and following the appropriate instructions; or (C) [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us-form), specifying the particular email list(s) from which you wish to be removed.

In addition, under “California’s Shine the Light” law, California residents may opt out of allowing us to: (A) share Personally Identifiable Information with MSO affiliates for their direct marketing purposes; and (B) share Personally Identifiable Information with third party companies for their marketing purposes. You may indicate your preferences to opt out of any combination of the choices above by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us-form). Please specify in your email from which choice you are opting out:

  1. Receiving promotional emails and electronic newsletters from MSO;
  2. Allowing MSO to share Personally Identifiable Information about you with MSO affiliates for their marketing purposes; and/or
  3. Allowing MSO to share Personally Identifiable Information about you with third-party companies for their marketing purposes.



We will respond to a request made pursuant to these methods as promptly as practicable. Even if you elect to stop receiving promotional emails from us, we may still contact you to tell you important information about our Online Services or us.

Please note, however, that even if you "opt out" as described above, we will not be able to remove Personally Identifiable Information about you from the databases of affiliates or third parties with which we have already shared your Personally Identifiable Information. If you wish to stop receiving marketing messages from such affiliates or third parties, please contact them directly or utilize the opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing messages.

**Can I review or change information in "Account Settings"?**

Yes. If you want to review, correct, or change Personally Identifiable Information in "Account Settings," please go to the [“Account Settings”](https://my.marthastewart.com/sign-in) section of our site and follow the appropriate instructions.

**Where will MSO store and maintain information about me?**

We maintain our Online Services in the United States. By (A) providing Personally Identifiable Information and other information directly to our websites, and/or (B) electing to become a Member via an existing social media account and thus providing MSO access to Personally Identifiable Information for that account on file with that social media provider, you understand and consent to the collection, use, processing, and transfer of such information to the United States and other countries or territories, which may not offer the same level of data protection as the country where you reside, in accordance with the terms of this Policy.

We encourage parents to use our Online Services with their children. However, our Online Services are not directed towards children under the age of 13, and we request that children under 13 not provide Personally Identifiable Information through our Online Services.

**Can MSO change this Policy?**

MSO may modify, alter, or update this Policy at any time. We may also change this Policy if we add any new services or features. We will notify you of any changes by posting the revised policy on this site with the date it was revised. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last Updated" legend at the top of this page.
