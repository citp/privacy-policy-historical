The Department does not currently collect personal information from this web site. The Maryland School Performance Report web site ([msp.msde.state.md.us](http://www.msde.state.md.us/)) contains a separate [privacy statement](http://msp.msde.state.md.us/introduction/privacy.asp). The Department does comply with the Maryland law that mandates that State agencies shall not create personal records unless the need for the information is clearly established and that personal records shall be relevant to the purposes for which they are collected, be accurate and current, and not be obtained by fraudulent means. State officials who request personal data from citizens must notify the citizens regarding the purposes for which the information is collected; consequences to the citizen for refusing to provide the personal information; the citizen’s right to inspect and correct personal records; whether the information is generally available for public inspection; and whether the information is made available to other entities.
