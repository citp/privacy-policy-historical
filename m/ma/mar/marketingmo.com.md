# Privacy Policy | Marketing MO - A Comprehensive Brand Strategy Toolkit

We understand that you care how information about you is stored and shared. In order to provide a safe, secure experience, we will make every effort to ensure that the information you give us remains private, and is used for the purposes described below.

## What information do we gather?

Marketing MO gathers collective information about our website visitors. An example of such is the number of visitors to the site, which areas of the site are visited most often and what services are most valued. We use this aggregated and anonymous data to help us determine how we can create a better overall experience for our visitors.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever users interact with us. For example, we use “cookies” to help us provide a more personalized experience. To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Marketing MO if your computer supports such capabilities.

The rest of the information we collect is the information you provide to us to utilize our product and services.

## Do we share the information we receive?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business. We only use that information internally to service customers and website visitors and to send promotional offers.

Furthermore, we understand that the information that customers create on and upload to our website as part of the services we offer is valuable and private, and owned by our customers. Thus, we do not review or share any of this information.

## How secure is my information?

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt information that you input into our site, both during the ordering process and in the customer area. We only reveal the last five digits of your credit card during order processing to our credit card processing company, and we do not store your credit card information in our database.

Our site has password security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We also implement advanced security and host our website in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. We also provide unique user names and passwords that must be entered for each client login. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of your data.

## Third-party sites

Our site contains links to other web sites. While we link to sites, references and tools that we use and like, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these others web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential.
