        In a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, dissolution (including bankruptcy), change of

        control, or a sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer information, including personal information,

        generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event that CLO undergoes such transactions,

        including preparation of any of such transactions, we may share, disclose or transfer all of your

        information, including personal information, to the successor. Any third party to which we transfer or

        sell our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide

        to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personal

        information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose personal information upon

        receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.

    <h4 class="tit">5. SAFEGUARDS</h4>

    <p>
        CLO maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal

        information we collect and store about our account holders. Personal information collected by CLO is

        stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible

        by authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and

        alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow web users

        to access their personal information, for example, we verify their identity by requesting that they submit

        information such as their username and password. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third

        parties to whom we transfer personal information provide sufficient protection of such data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your personal information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the country of

        your residence. It may also be processed by personnel of our Affiliates and third party service providers

        who may operate outside the country of your residence. In such case, we will take reasonable steps to

        require such third party in possession of your personal information to take commercially reasonable

        security measures to protect the information.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be

        guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you

        acknowledge that: (a) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged

        between you and us through our Services cannot be guaranteed; and (b) any such information and data

        may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.
