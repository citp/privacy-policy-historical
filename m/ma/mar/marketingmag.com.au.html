				<p class="page_break"></p><p>At Marketing we understand that privacy is important, and we've created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information.</p>

<p>We revaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:</p>

<p>Privacy Officer
Niche Media Pty Ltd.
170 Dorcas Street
South Melbourne VIC 3205
AUSTRALIA</p>

<p>Or to <a href="mailto:websupport@niche.com.au" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">websupport@niche.com.au</a></p>

<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our Web site will contain a special notice about the changes.</p>

<h3>Marketing Online Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Marketing collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use <a href="" http:="" www.marketingmag.com.au"="" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">www.marketingmag.com.au</a>. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that Marketing print edition subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from our online users.</p>

<h3>Information we collect and how we use it</h3>

<p></p>When you visit <a href="http://www.marketingmag.com.au" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">www.marketingmag.com.au</a>, Marketing collects several forms of usage data, including:<p></p>

<p>Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.</p>

<p>Cookie data. When you visit <a href="http://www.marketingmag.com.au" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">www.marketingmag.com.au</a>, Marketing or one of our affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies" (small files containing a string of characters) to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with <a href="http://www.marketingmag.com.au" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">www.marketingmag.com.au</a>, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven't registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.</p>

<p>Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable Marketing to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the Marketing site.</p>

<p>Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on <a href="http://www.marketingmag.com.au" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">www.marketingmag.com.au</a>.</p>

<p>The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:</p>

<p></p><ul><li>To improve the content and design of <a href="http://www.marketingmag.com.au" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">www.marketingmag.com.au</a>.</li>
<li>To enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the site.</li>
<li>To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.</li>
<li>To help us understand more about the interests of our users, so that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Many portions of the Marketing site can be used without registering or giving us any personal information such as (but not limited to) your name and e-mail address. However, Marketing does collect personally identifying information regarding our online users, including in the following ways:</p>

<p>When you provide it to us, such as (but not limited to) by entering a contest, becoming a registered member, signing up for a newsletter or tutorial, or otherwise contacting us. When you provide it to a company that powers a portion of our site or provides a special feature, such as a contest registration, that appears on our site. When you provide information about yourself or your company to Marketing in connection with a subscription order, that information may be included in your Marketing user record, if one exists.</p>

<p>If you have previously registered with another Niche Media website and you begin to fill out certain forms on <a href="http://www.marketingmag.com.au" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">www.marketingmag.com.au</a>, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your Marketing user record. If you have provided information to <a href="http://www.marketingmag.com.au" class="has_ext_link" target="_blank">www.marketingmag.com.au</a>, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.</p>

<p>The personal information we collect may be used in a number of ways, including the following:</p>
<p></p><ol>
<li>To improve the content of the Marketing site, including by allowing Marketingís editors to consult with readers.</li>
<li>To communicate with users about registration and other customer service issues.</li>
<li>To promote products and services of Marketing or Niche Media Pty Ltd.</li>
<li>To conduct research surveys on behalf of Marketing, Niche Media Pty Ltd, and its subsidiaries and affiliates.</li></ol><p></p>

<h3>Information sharing</h3>

<p>Marketing may share aggregated, non-personal information, such as website traffic figures, with third parties. This aggregated information does not identify you individually. We may share personal information with your consent or in order to provide products or services you have requested. In addition, by using the site you agree that we may also share personal information in any of the following circumstances:</p>

<p>We may use or disclose personal information if we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is reasonably necessary (a) to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) to enforce agreements we have with you, (c) to address fraud or security issues, or (d) to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Marketing, Niche Media Pty Ltd, or our employees or customers.</p>
<p>We may share personal information with trusted affiliates or third parties, such as credit card processors or fulfilment providers, who process information or perform services on our behalf.</p>
<p>If you submit personal information on a portion of our site that is operated by a third party, such as our price comparison service, we may share the information you submit with the third party, and the information may be used by that party as permitted under that party's privacy policy. Marketing and its parent and affiliate companies are not responsible for the third party's actions or policies. Portions of the site operated by third parties normally include a "Powered by" logo naming the third party, or have forms that include links to the third party's privacy policy.</p>

    <p>*We may transfer personal information from your user record to your subscriber record, if one exists, provided that we also transfer any preferences you have set for how that personal information is used. Any information transferred to the subscriber database will be governed by the Marketing Subscriber Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may share information with third parties for promotional purposes, as described below.</p>

<p>In addition, you should be aware that when you disclose personal information such as your name or e-mail address in a forum, blog comment, or other area that is publicly accessible by others, that information can be collected and used by others. Marketing and its parent and affiliate companies are not responsible for any information that you provide in the above areas.</p>

<h3>Use of data for promotions, and choices for personal information</h3>

<p>Postal addresses will be used to promote Marketing and Niche Media Pty Ltd products and services, and may be rented and/or licensed to selected outside firms for promotional purposes. Offers for which the postal address data is rented and/or licensed for use are screened and the users are required to target their offers carefully.</p>

<p>When you provide your e-mail address to us, you agree to receive e-mail from Marketing, and Niche Media Pty Ltd; however, you can unsubscribe from these e-mails at any time simply by clicking the unsubscribe link within the boy of the e-mail. We allow you to opt out of receiving e-mail regarding third-party offers, both when e-mail information is collected and with each use of your address. If you do not opt out at the time your e-mail address is collected, or do not respond to the questions concerning how we may use your e-mail address, your address may be used for third-party offers. Offers for which the e-mail address is rented and/or licensed for use are screened and the users are required to target their offers carefully.</p>

<p>In addition, you may change your preferences regarding use of personal data by sending e-mail to websupport@niche.com.au.</p>

<p>If Marketing or any of its products is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of some or all of its assets, all personally identifying information and other data will be transferred to the new owner.</p>

				<h2>Marketing Magazine Contributor FAQs</h2>
				<h3>Which is the best way to contact the editor?</h3>

<p>I much prefer emails, without a doubt. Attach your submission to an email but don’t forget to include a short paragraph explaining the gist of your piece in case I don’t get time to open the attachment. Please send to me at: <a href="mailto:kylie.Flavell@niche.com.au">kylie.Flavell@niche.com.au.</a></p>

<h3>Why haven’t I heard back?</h3>

<p>Last month I received a total of 964 emails so it does take some time. That said, no email is ever left unopened. If you send me something on global warming and I know there is a Green issue coming up, I may save your email in that month’s folder and contact you closer to that date. If you really want an answer ASAP feel free to send a follow-up email to remind me that you are still waiting!</p>

<h3>How far ahead do you work?</h3>

<p>I commission articles for each issue THREE MONTHS PRIOR. It is never too early to contact me. Many companies have our features list and simply select the features or themed issues relevant to their business and submit related articles at the start of the year. Pages get booked out well in advance.</p>

<h3>What do I need to send you with my article?</h3>


<p>Please include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high res head shot of the author. This must be 300 dpi in jpg or tif format. It can be colour or black and white.</li>
<li>A 40-word bio of the author including email, website or phone details.</li>
<li>Any high res images or tables that you would like to accompany your piece or a note explaining what type of images you could potentially source at a later date.</li>
<li>Your article in a WORD DOCUMENT. Not a pdf, not a zip file, not a power point slide.</li>
<li>Any related case studies (can be from 200 – 800 words).</li>
<li>A brief paragraph within the body of your email explaining the premise of your article.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How long should my piece be?</h3>

<p>A one-page article is generally 800 words. A two-page article is about 1200 words. If you have something longer I will consider running a three-page article if it is particularly engaging or you have several images to include.</p>

<h3>I have a short news item or event listing to contribute, what should I do?</h3>

<p>You are welcome to send any news items to both myself and our online editor Kate Kendall. <a href="mailto:kate.kendall@niche.com.au">kate.kendall@niche.com.au</a>. Generally our news items in the print magazine are from 250-500 words. Please re-write any press releases so that they are from an objective viewpoint. Naturally we will be editing them ourselves, but those that are ready to go and devoid of self-promotion and hyperbole are more likely to be published first. For event listings you have the option of appearing online or in our For Your Diary section in the print magazine. Please provide the dates, venue, contact details and a 40-word description of your event.</p>

<h3>What are the Focus sections?</h3>

<p>As of April 2009 we began running our 'focus sections' every month to ensure readers have a cross-section of all types of marketing every single issue. Each section provides in-depth analysis, commentary and insight. You are welcome to submit a by-lined article for any of these sections as all the content is written by industry experts as opposed to our features, which are written in-house. Article lengths must be 800 or 1200 words.</p>

<p><strong>Media &amp; Advertising:</strong> Our focus on creative, agency comment and the world of media - including print, television, radio and out of home advertising. Some of the regulars in this section include Guerrilla Guide, written by our most popular contributor Geoffrey Bowll and Recipe of the Month, which showcases a highly successful campaign in a comprehensive case study that always includes in-depth results. We also look at events, retail and the key role that design plays in branding.</p>

<p><strong>Digital:</strong> We're talking mobile, social media, rich media advertising, corporate blogs, digital OOH, email, podcasts, in-game advertising, search, company websites, seeding brands in the blogosphere, banner ads, online consumer surveys, Twitter, SEM and anything else related to digital. Regular columns include Mister Mobile with Joe Barber, Around the Blogosphere with Stanley Johnson and Homepage with CEO of IAB Paul Fisher. This section also identifies the best way for the marketing department to work successfully with IT or a digital agency.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing Strategy:</strong> Deciding how to split your marketing budget? Keen to analyse what sort of ROI you can anticipate from your latest campaign? This is the section where we focus on results, marketing analysis and tactical methods that can be applied to all marketing regardless of your advertising channel. Regulars include On a Shoestring, which is our monthly look at marketing for SMEs and B2B Straight Up, which looks at business-to-business marketing. In addition, thought leaders such as Michael Kiely and David Gillespie contribute their regular columns on holistic brand strategy and integration.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Marketing:</strong> Direct marketing (DM) is in no way just limited to direct mail. In this section we cover DM as a marketing discipline, analysing anything that draws on that one-to-one relationship between the marketer and the consumer. This includes anything from email and SMS to promotional products and transpromotional mail. We also take a close look at the topics of data and loyalty, showing how you can retain your brand evangelists, grow your database and prevent churn. Regular columnists include international DM expert Linda Loose, CEO of Clemenger Proximity Andy Pontin, and joint team Douglas Nicol and Kevin MacMillan from agency The Works.</p>

<p><strong>Careers &amp; Education:</strong> With the industry changing so rapidly the competitive marketer, CEO or agency creative needs to be constantly updating their skills and knowledge. This section details how to climb the ladder, stay on top and win your dream job. Our regular column Going Global profiles a different country each month, examining its marketing industry, average salaries and the job opportunities that exist for Aussies looking to move. Changing Lanes looks at sector transition, with comment from a recruiter and a candidate that has made a change such as FMCG to services or digital to events, etc. There is also a look at the latest marketing research project being undertaken by university academics around Australia with our regular column Research and Deploy. This section speaks to the student marketer but to a larger extent, the marketing practitioner looking to advance their career.</p>

<h3>When will my fabulous article be available?</h3>

<p>Generally each issue goes on sale on the 28th of the previous month. So for example, June’s issue is at newsstands on the 28th May. If you have contributed an article or comment then we are happy to send you a complimentary copy a week prior to the sale date. Please be sure to send your postal details to me with your article. If you wish to buy more copies you can visit a newsagent or Borders bookstore or contact our Subscriptions Department via e-mail: <a href="mailto:subscriptions@niche.com.au">subscriptions@niche.com.au</a> or free call: 1800 804 160. </p>

<h3>I see you have a feature coming up, how does my CEO/marketing director get involved for comment in that feature?</h3>

<p>Most of our features are written in-house and we like to interview a range of experts in the industry for each piece. If you have someone in mind for comment, please email me a brief description of their expertise (not just a bio but something that directly relates to our feature), as well as a general idea of their availability. Most of our interviews are conducted by phone or email as we are often too busy to get out of the office.
