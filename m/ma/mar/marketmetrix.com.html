<p>Market Metrix, LLC is committed to protecting the privacy of the information in our care. In providing services to our clients, we act as a Data Processor; collecting and analyzing survey data from our clients’ customers and presenting the results back to our clients. We do not collect personally identifiable information of our client’s customers. We return aggregate reporting data to our clients.</p>
<p><strong>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Market Metrix collects personal information in several different ways:</p>
<p><strong>Contact Us</strong> – The Contact Us portion of this website collects personal information, such as name, company and email address, for purposes of facilitating business communication between Market Metrix and individuals or companies. It is not shared with any third party or used in ways not disclosed by this privacy agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Our Clients</strong> – Personal information used within our services for our customers is either provided off-line and entered into our system by our Professional Services team or gathered online and entered by our customers. Updates, deletions and additions to this data may be made online by authenticated users through our client websites or by making a request to our Professional Services staff via mail, phone, email, or through the contact us link at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p><strong>Client Customers (Surveys)</strong> – Market Metrix clients provide us with personal information for their customers, such as name, phone number, email address, company, city, state, etc., which is then used by Market Metrix to invite these customers to take surveys concerning the products or services offered by our client. All personal information for our client customers that is used for the generation of these surveys and associated reports are provided to us via secured digital transmission. This information is used to facilitate these surveys and will only be used in ways disclosed by this privacy agreement.</p>
<p>Anyone may request to have their email addresses added to our “do not contact” list by following the “opt-out” link provided in the survey invitation, by mail, or by email to <a href="mailto:WebSupport@marketmetrix.com">WebSupport@marketmetrix.com</a>. Opt-outs through the form are instantaneous; all other methods may require up to 10 days from receipt of request. Our ‘do-not-contact’ list applies to all of our clients.</p>
<p><em>Aside from our surveys, below are the email communications sent by our site: </em></p>
