**Collection of your Personal Information**

Through the Clarabridge website, Clarabridge collects Personal Data through the features of its website and in the course of providing a variety of services to consumers and to business partners.  As used throughout this privacy policy, the term “Personal Data” refers to data that personally identifies as individual, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. In addition to Personal Data, Clarabridge also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites (“Anonymous Data”).  This privacy policy does not limit Clarabridge’s collection, use, processing or sharing of Anonymous Data.

There is also Anonymous Data about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Clarabridge. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Clarabridge for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Clarabridge website.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose Personal Data through Clarabridge public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others.

Clarabridge encourages you to review the privacy policies of websites you choose to link to from Clarabridge so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Clarabridge is not responsible for the privacy policies or other content on websites other than the Clarabridge website, and the terms of this privacy policy do not apply to any other websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites.

Clarabridge provides online feedback collection services to its clients. Typically clients provide Clarabridge with data on customers and other stakeholders such as name, company, location and email address, which Clarabridge uses to invite participants to complete surveys or feedback forms.

**Choices and Access regarding your Personal Information**

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or the purchase of our products or services and may contain advertisements for third party companies. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings, we may share your e-mail address with third parties to ensure that you do not receive further communications from third parties. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or privacy policy.

Before Clarabridge collects Sensitive Data (defined below) directly from any consumer, Clarabridge will offer the consumer an opportunity to opt-in to such collection, and we will provide an explanation of our privacy practices related to that information, if those practices differ materially from this privacy policy.  If a consumer does not opt-in to such collection, Clarabridge will not collect the Sensitive Data.  In such instances, however, Clarabridge may be unable to provide the services for which the Sensitive Data would otherwise be collected.  An individual may elect to withdraw his/her consent to future collections of Sensitive Data by sending a written notice to Clarabridge at the email address or postal address set forth below.  Such notice should state clearly that the individual wishes to withdraw his/her consent to Clarabridge’s future collection of Sensitive Data directly from the individual.  Following Clarabridge’s receipt of that notice, Clarabridge will take steps to stop future collections within a reasonable time.  For purposes of this privacy policy, “Sensitive Data” refers to Personal Data that pertains to racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, health or sex life, or any other information regarding which applicable law requires opt-in consent prior to its collection.  Anonymous Data about such topics (i.e., similar data that is not associated with any data that personally identifies you) is not Sensitive Data.

Changes to Personal Data. If you wish to access, correct or amend any Personal Data about you Clarabridge holds, you may submit a request by calling 571-299-1800 or emailing privacy@clarabridge.com.  We will exercise good faith efforts to provide access to such Personal Data to the extent it is available within a reasonable time, and will exercise good faith efforts to correct or amend information that you believe to be inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access, correction or amendment would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights of other persons would be violated.  You may also request deletion of your Personal Data by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.

Please also be aware that, as part of its customary business activities, Clarabridge acts as a service provider to its business partners.  Whenever Clarabridge receives Personal Data from its business partners, Clarabridge relies upon those business partners to obtain any consent from consumers that may be required to authorize Clarabridge’s privacy practices related to the applicable Personal Data, and Clarabridge does not provide choice to individuals regarding Clarabridge’s collection and use of the Personal Data received from those business partners.  Clarabridge is not responsible for the policies or practices of those business partners with respect to the Personal Data those business partners collect.

In some circumstances applicable law may provide consumers a right to request a report regarding Clarabridge’s disclosures of Personal Data about himself or herself, and Clarabridge will always undertake to provide such information as required by applicable law.  For example, pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (the “Shine the Light Law”), a California resident may request an information statement from Clarabridge regarding disclosures of Personal Data about that resident, if any, that Clarabridge has made to third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.  All such requests should be submitted in writing to Clarabridge at the email address or postal address set forth below.  Clarabridge will endeavor to respond to such requests within a reasonable time by providing a report that includes the information required by applicable law.  Please be advised that, Clarabridge is not required to respond to requests from any individual resident under the Shine the Light Law more frequently than once per calendar year.

However, if you plan to export the graph to Excel or PDF, your aggregated data must be sent to Google in order to generate the file. No detailed records are sent to Google, and only the data labels and numbers actually displayed on the exported graph are transmitted.

**Use of Cookies**

The Clarabridge website use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Clarabridge pages, or register with Clarabridge site or services, a cookie helps Clarabridge to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Clarabridge website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Clarabridge features that you customized.

Clarabridge also works with advertisers and service providers, like Google, who may have placed one or more cookies on your computer either at the time of your visit to the Clarabridge website or when you visit other websites for which they provide services.  We partner with those companies to assist us in marketing Clarabridge’s products and services on third party websites to individuals, like you, who have previously visited the Clarabridge website or have otherwise demonstrated an interest in our products and services.  If you prefer, you may opt out of Google’s use of cookies for this kind of interest-based advertising by modifying Google’s [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCjMPME25BHp5gVH5ySgedgIltWtJ2V57vghjp00ornbyNvLP7GXrTKHUH2eUwPW4lIGpZNKEZy-Ye26EP6q_e-3WlsVU1wD3Xu_eqRkrcieXbZGddXupl75eZamrrcpUTiks0G1qjuXEnzwM3kxLNzUYZ9e4OmpnS58Xxc8RFN72uaGiO7TlTYOuyE_jLNYkGw0R9aKbUBOkEj85uLcI7FvdX_I_Q). You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Clarabridge services or websites you visit.  At this time, however, the Clarabridge website does not respond to “Do No Track” signals, and the website may therefore collect any information that an end user’s browser provides, such as information identifying the end user’s operating system and Internet protocol address.

**Information Retention, Security and Integrity**

We may maintain Personal Data in our databases for so long as we believe it is necessary or beneficial for purposes of developing, providing and improving our services, even indefinitely, except to the extent we are required to remove such Personal Data by applicable law, and except as described above regarding Sensitive Data.  Even after we remove Personal Data from the databases that we use in active operation of our business, some or all of that Personal Data may be retained in our inactive archival backups of those databases.

We exercise reasonable security measures consistent with industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to Personal Data stored in our databases, and to prevent unauthorized use, alteration, corruption or disclosure of that Personal Data.  Personal Data stored in our possession is maintained behind firewalls, and our servers are located within facilities that are subject to physical security measures designed to prevent unauthorized access.

We restrict access to Personal Data to our employees, contractors and agents who need to access that information in order to operate our business in a manner consistent with this privacy policy.  All such personnel are required to treat Personal Data in a manner consistent with this privacy policy, and they are subject to discipline, potentially including termination, if they fail to comply with those requirements.

While we believe our policies and practices regarding information security and integrity are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the security and/or integrity of Personal Data will not be breached or that such Personal Data will not be subject to unauthorized access, alteration, corruption or disclosure.  We review our information security policies and practices periodically and may update them as we determine reasonably necessary to achieve information security and integrity consistent with industry standards.
