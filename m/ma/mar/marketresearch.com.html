		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>The Way We Use Information</strong> 
		<br>
		<br>
		We use your personal information to provide requested information and services  to you and to help ensure that the information we provide to you is relevant to  your specific needs. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When you buy something, your information will be stored on our system to complete the buying process. It must be shared with an outside party in order to verify your credit card information. We also record information about your questions to us and your purchases so that we and you can keep track of what you've asked about or ordered directly on our site. Additionally, we may need to contact you about your questions and/or your orders.  
		<br>
		<br>
		We use email addresses to send you the Alerts or newsletters you've requested, to answer the email we receive and to communicate with you about publications which you have told us you would be interested in hearing about.   
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Other Parties' Collection and Use of Your Information</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		We do not share, sell, rent, or trade personal identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes. 
		<br>
		<br>
		We do use agents, service providers and other third parties to provide some services on our site. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes then those described below: 
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Agents</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		Publishers:
		<br>
		We may share your contact information with the publisher(s) whose reports you purchase. The publisher(s) may send you marketing materials. If you do not wish to receive these materials you will need to contact the publisher directly in order to opt-out (providing the publisher offers an opt-out). 
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Service Providers</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		Shipping: 
		<br>
		Our publishers use an outside shipping service provider to fulfill orders. These orders will be shipped to you directly from the publisher. In these cases, the publisher receives your contact information. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Credit  Card Processing:
		<br>
		When you buy something with a credit card, we use a credit card processing service provider to verify your credit card and bill you. In addition, the name of your company (but not your name or contact information) will be shared with the publisher of the information you bought. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Other Third Parties</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		Tracking  Service:
		<br>
		A third party tracking service provider may set cookies on our website to help us track to what extent sales are being generated from various marketing efforts. This information is only used in the aggregate. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  
		<br>
		<br>
		Also, our third party tracking service employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of website users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to users' personally identifiable information but are used only by MarketResearch.com to determine the effectiveness of various marketing programs. 
		<br>
		<br>
