**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION & USE THEREOF**

It is Marvel's policy to respect and protect the privacy of visitors to Marvel's website. Accordingly, Marvel DOES NOT extract without permission personal information about its visitors or their computer at any time while on Marvel's website. Marvel will, however, analyze information about our visitors as a group to make our website better, but visitors are not individually identified when we do this. 

Marvel will collect personal information such as names, home addresses, e-mail addresses, age, etc., but only when a visitor voluntarily gives it to us in the process of ordering subscriptions or the Marvel newsletters, entering contests or sweepstakes, or registering with the Marvel website. This information is used internally by Marvel to fulfill your requests and for marketing and research purposes. Marvel will NOT sell, rent or give a visitor's personal information to any third party unless Marvel asks for and receives the visitor's permission at the time the personal information is collected. Marvel does however, share aggregate information about the users of Marvel's website with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and certain others. As mentioned above, this aggregate information is used to develop, improve and customize Marvel's website to better serve visitors to our website. Where Marvel.com's information collection activities involve children, Marvel.com provides special privacy protections. 

Marvel is committed to protecting the online privacy of children. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), Marvel will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without first obtaining parental consent. Prior to providing any personally identifiable information (your name, email address, address, phone number etc.), either by placing an order for merchandise, setting up a Marvel.com account, entering a contest or sweepstakes (if eligible), or participating in any other activity offered through the Marvel.com site, children under the age of thirteen (13) must have a parent or legal guardian complete and return (by mail or fax) a Parental Consent Form to MARVEL.COM - Marvel Enterprises, Inc., 10 East 40th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10016; or by fax to: 212 576 8507. The consent form states that the child's "Parent" or "Legal Guardian", by his or her signature, consents to the collection and transfer of the child's personally identifiable information. Consent may be revoked by completing a "Marvel Revocation of Parental Consent Form" and sending it to the address or fax number above. 

In compliance with COPPA, Marvel is sensitive about children consulting with parents or guardians before furnishing personal information or ordering anything online. It's also Marvel's intention to adhere to the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) Guidelines on Internet advertising with its special sensitivities regarding solicitations to children under thirteen (13). Marvel encourages parents/guardians to supervise and join their children in exploring cyberspace. Marvel is proud of its website and believes that it is suitable for Marvel fans of all ages. 

Occasionally, Marvel may ask, on a voluntary basis and with prior parental permission, if appropriate, for personal information to provide to sponsors of particular activities and/or products. This will be made clear in each individual case where we have third-party sponsors. In the event children under the age of thirteen (13) are eligible, with parental consent, to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other activities offered through our site, we will only collect and use information (e.g., email address, mailing address, name, age) to the extent that it is necessary to administer the activity. We will never require that, as a condition of participation, a child disclose more information than is necessary to participate in an activity. 

Please note that if a parent does not permit Marvel.com's use or collection of personally identifiable information or has instructed Marvel to delete personally identifiable information, a child's participation in those Marvel.com activities for which the personally identifiable information has been requested may not be possible. 

Marvel will not disclose information collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) (or from adults for that matter) to third parties unless indicated otherwise or in special cases where Marvel has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (whether intentionally or unintentionally) with Marvel's rights or property or anyone else who may be harmed by such actions or if required by law. 

Marvel recommends that parents/guardians monitor and supervise the online activities of their children and to consider using available parental control tools which can prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. Visitors to Marvel's website who are under thirteen (13) years old should not be submitting any personal information like their name, address, e-mail address, phone number etc. without a parent's or guardian's permission. 

**  
CORRESPONDENCE & WEEKLY NEWSLETTERS**

Marvel uses automated e-mail systems to e-mail weekly newsletters and to collect and answer correspondence from our visitors. While Marvel may not have the time or manpower to individually answer each piece of correspondence, we do read all of them! 

Marvel tries to make it easy for visitors to contact Marvel.com and we provide easy instructions on our website on how you can either edit information previously given (such as your address) or remove yourself from automated messages generated by Marvel. Should you have a technical problem doing this please contact HelpDesk@marvel.com. 

**COOKIES**

Marvel uses "cookie" technology to enhance a visitor's online experience by making it easier to navigate through our website or to make an activity work better. 

Cookies are small pieces of information or files that a website puts on a computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow a computer to "remember" information from our website for future use. The use of cookies is an industry standard and is practiced by most major websites.

Marvel DOES NOT use cookies to collect or record personally identifiable information about visitors to Marvel.com. Marvel uses information collected by cookies to learn about our visitors' preferences, so that we can make our website better. The information is about our visitors as a whole, not about individuals. 

**ELECTRONIC POSTCARDS**

Visitors to Marvel.com can send electronic postcards to their friends. In order to do this visitors are asked to provide only their first name and their friend's first name and e-mail address, all of which are deleted once the postcard is sent.  
******  
REQUESTS FOR FEEDBACK**

Marvel.com may request feedback from visitors regarding an activity or piece of content on the Marvel.com website. Feedback is used for internal purposes only, and any personally identifiable information that is accidentally submitted is deleted. 

**ADVERTISEMENTS AND LINKS**

Marvel.com may include advertisements and/or links to websites operated by third parties that are not sponsors and are not affiliated with Marvel. Marvel tries to make sure that when there are links off the Marvel website, they are working and lead visitors to interesting, fun and informative areas. However, it is hard to guarantee what exactly is presented on other sites or where links elsewhere may lead. Marvel is not responsible for the content, practices, or information provided or requested on websites operated by third parties. Further, advertisements on and links to or from Marvel.com do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Marvel of the content, policies, practices or products or services offered on these websites. Marvel.com will always mark advertisements as advertisements and will display and notify visitors when they are leaving Marvel.com.

Parents/guardians should check each website's privacy policy and terms of use in order to understand their policies and practices regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information. Marvel also suggests that parents/guardians review the privacy policies of all websites that their children visit, including those websites linking to or from the Marvel websites. Information provided to those websites will be subject to the privacy policy posted at that website.

**SECURITY**

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with Marvel.com visitors is of utmost concern to us. Marvel exercises great care and implements a variety of technologies to make the Marvel website as secure as possible against unauthorized access and to protect the information visitors choose to provide to us. Marvel periodically reviews and updates these measures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be one hundred percent (100%) secure. As a result, while Marvel strives to protect a visitor's personal information, Marvel can not ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us or from our online products or services, and a visitor does so at his/her own risk. Marvel uses the industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption when credit card information is transmitted to us. 

**REVIEW AND DELETION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

You may review and delete your personally identifiable information contained in Marvel's records at any time. If you would like to review or delete this information, please contact us at:

**IMPORTANT NOTICE to Children Under the Age of thirteen (13):**

Prior to providing any personally identifiable information (your name, email address, address, phone number etc.), either by placing an order for merchandise, setting up a Marvel.com account, entering a contest or sweepstakes (if eligible), or participating in any other activity offered through the Marvel.com site, children under the age of thirteen (13) must have a "Parent" or "Legal Guardian" complete and return (by mail or fax) a [Parental Consent Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20031204194520id_/http://www.marvel.com/about/privacy/pdfs/consent.pdf) to MARVEL.COM - Marvel Enterprises, Inc., 10 East 40th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10016; or by fax to: 212.576.8507. The consent form states that the child's "Parent" or "Legal Guardian," by his or her signature, consents to the collection and transfer of the child's personally identifiable information. Consent may be revoked by completing a "[Marvel Revocation of Parental Consent Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20031204194520id_/http://www.marvel.com/about/privacy/pdfs/revocation.pdf)" and sending it to the address or fax number above. 

If parental consent has been given, Marvel will only collect and use personal information (e.g., email address, mailing address, payment method and details) to the extent necessary to administer the requested activity. For example, the information will be used to: 1. To process and fulfill orders for subscriptions; 2\. To send the Marvel Newsletter or other pertinent information by email; and 3. To notify winners of contests and sweepstakes (if children under thirteen (13) were eligible). 

Information collected may also be used by Marvel for internal review purposes in aggregate.

Marvel will not disclose information collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) (or from adults for that matter) to third parties unless indicated otherwise or in special cases where Marvel has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (whether intentionally or unintentionally) with Marvel's rights or property or anyone else who may be harmed by such actions or if required by law.
