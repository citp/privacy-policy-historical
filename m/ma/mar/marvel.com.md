# Marvel wants to protect your privacy

What about my privacy?

It is Marvel's policy to fundamentally respect and protect the privacy of visitors to our websites. 

We DO NOT extract individual information about you or your computer at any time on our website. We will analyze information about our users as a group to make our websites better, but you won't be individually identified when we do this.

We collect personal information like names or addresses, e-mail addresses, age, etc., but only when you voluntarily give it to us in sweepstakess, guestbooks or subscriptions. The most important thing we do with this information is to fulfill the activity you signed up for, like notifying winners or sending you our newsletter. This information is also used for internal purposes, such as marketing and research. But, it WILL NOT be sold, rented or given to anyone else unless we ask for and receive your permission at the time we collect personal information from you.

If you're under twelve years old, you should not be submitting any personal information like this without your parents' permission. You'll notice that when we have pages which ask for personal information we include reminders asking kids to get parental permission before submitting. 

We may occasionally ask, on a voluntary basis and with prior parental permission, if appropriate, for personal information to provide to sponsors of particular activities. This will be made clear in each individual case where we have third-party sponsors and you will have the opportunity to participate in these activities even if you choose not to give permission to Marvel to share this information with our sponsors. 

MAIL'S IN!  
Marvel uses automated e-mail systems to communicate with registered members of our premium website, the Marvel Zone, to operate a weekly broadcast the "Mighty Marvel Mailer" and to collect and answer regular correspondence. Sometimes we don't have time to answer every message, but we do read all of them!

We try to make it easy to contact us and try give you easy instructions on how to remove yourself from automated messages each time we send you one. Please contact help@marvel.com with technical problems only.

SNACK TIME   
We may occasionally use "cookie" technology to enhance your online experience by making it easier for you to navigate through our pages or to make an activity work better. 

Cookies are small files our website puts on your hard disk which allow your computer to "remember" information for future use. We DO NOT extract individual information about you or your computer during this process. 

We will analyze information about our users as a group to make our websites better, but you won't be individually identified when we do this.

LINKS   
We try to make sure that when there are links off our site, they are working and lead you to interesting, fun and informative areas. But it's hard to guarantee what exactly is presented on other sites or where links elsewhere may lead to. So, we can't be responsible when you leave our site and we recommend that kids check with an adult before surfing off to any new sites.

SECURITY  
Marvel implements a variety of technologies to make our websites as secure as possible against unauthorized access and to protect the information you choose to provide to us. We periodically review and update these measures. 

SOME OF US ARE PARENTS, TOO   
We're sensitive about children consulting with parents or guardians before furnishing personal information or ordering anything online. We try to remind kids about this and we encourage parents to supervise and join their children in exploring cyberspace. We're proud of our website, believe that it is suitable for Marvel fans of all ages and hope you enjoy it too. 

Parents should also be aware of a growing variety of software capable of filtering online information to reflect their own choices and guidelines.
