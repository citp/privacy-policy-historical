# Privacy Policy - The Marketing Resource Center

| 

## Concept Marketing Group, Inc. - Privacy Policy

**Concept Marketing Group** and **The Marketing Resource Center** collect personal information from users on a voluntary basis only. This information allows us to provide users with the products and services and allow access to secure and subscription areas of our site. 

**_We do not sell or distribute our users' personal or business information to anyone for any reason._**

The display of all information when in the forum, press releases, or classifieds ads may be suppressed. All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal or business contact information, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited emails, postal mail, or phone calls from third parties, for which Concept Marketing Group is not responsible.

 **CREDIT CARD SECURITY**  
MarketingSource.com employs the highest level of encryption for secure credit card transactions. Credit card and contact information is not stored in a publically accessable system that could be compromised, and are destroyed upon successful completion and fulfillment of the transaction. With this kind of security policy, it is safer to use your credit card online with Concept Marketing Group than it is to use it for mail order or telephone order transactions. If you have concerns, you should review your credit card agreement of call the company that issues your card to ask about policies regarding liability for fraudulent Internet charges.

 **COOKIES**  
In addition to the personally identifiable information that Marketingsource actively collects when you register for products and services, we also collect anonymous information passively using cookies and Web beacons. This technology plays an important role in making the Internet work, but there is much confusion among Internet users about what cookies and Web beacons are and how they are used. 

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the Web site. This unique number identifies your Web browser to our computer system whenever you visit one of the sites in the Marketingsource Network. A cookie will not allow a Web site to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. 

Cookies allow Marketingsource to automatically remember your Web browser when you visit our Network of Web sites. To help serve you better, Marketingsource generally uses cookies to allow us to deliver products and services more efficiently and measure statistics.

 **WEB BEACONS**  
Also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that Marketingsource may place on Web pages and within Web-based email newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, Web beacons allow Marketingsource to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page on the Marketingsource Network and the number of times those pages are displayed. We can also use Web beacons to let us know how many people opened a Web-based email newsletter. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your personally identifiable information. 

Without cookies and Web beacons, it would be difficult for Marketingsource to know which services have a larger audience than others. Tracking audience size helps us to better understand when to launch new services and enhance the current offerings. Keep in mind that any image file on a Web page can act as a Web beacon. Third-party advertising networks for Marketingsource like may use Web beacons in their advertisements. 

Because Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies, you can prevent our Web beacon from collecting anonymous information by setting your Web browser to refuse all cookies or the Marketingsource Network cookie in particular. Web beacons are built into our Web pages, so non-functional Web beacons will continue to appear even if you refuse the Marketingsource Network cookie.
