Updated November 1, 2010

MarketingZone is an online service that provides how-to marketing information, a resource for finding marketing experts with specific skills and expertise, and an online community for small businesses and marketing experts to "converse" about all things related to marketing. More details about MarketingZone.com can be found below under “How you can contact us.”

We understand that providing information online involves a great deal of trust on your part. We take this trust very seriously, and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. Before submitting your personal information to our website, please read this Policy carefully to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting MarketingZone's website, [www.marketingzone.com](http://www.marketingzone.com/ "www.marketingzone.com"), you are accepting the practices described herein.

##  What information we collect from you

In General

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, user name and password. We may also request information about your small business, marketing experience, demographic data, etc. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered member. For example, only registered members are able to give advice and comment on our How-To articles, e-mail MarketingZone content to themselves and others, access member-only newsletters, and enter surveys, contests, or sweepstakes. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to initiate other transactions on our site.

Automatic Information

We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit MarketingZone. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, web browser software, and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed and pages visited. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests of our users and customize your user experience.

Cookies and Other Web Technologies

Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits). MarketingZone.com and its affiliated websites use cookies for the following general purposes:

  * To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
  * To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon).



The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the tools offered on our site.

Our site also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.

Display of Advertising/Your Choices

_Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising_

MarketingZone is committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your marketing-related searches, such as whether you are looking for How To information or Finding an Expert, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests.

We do not share your personal information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements.

Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.
  * _Business partners_ with whom we may offer products or services in conjunction. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear either with ours or separately. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.
  * _Affiliated websites_. If you were referred to MarketingZone from another website, we may share your registration information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and travel preferences, about you with that referring website.

We also may share your information:

  * In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
  * When we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of MarketingZone, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.



If you choose to create a profile on MarketingZone, certain information in your profile will be publicly viewable and identifiable via your screen name.
