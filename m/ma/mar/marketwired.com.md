##  Information Gathered by Marketwired

For visitors to our website, subscribers to our newsletters, clients and prospective clients of our service (collectively referred to as a "User" or "Users"), we log standard technical information such as your IP address, interactions on different pages, and browser information. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our website and in reporting capacities as identified below to companies with whom Marketwired works, including its clients, partners, etc. For example, your IP address may be used to help identify you and your account information and to gather demographic information, or to maintain an aggregated log of click activity on our website.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your account. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to you.

We may also collect additional information from you when you fill out a form. Marketwired requires registration for certain services, such as the distribution of your press releases, and purchase of licenses to our Software-as-a-Service products. Our website may also contain order forms for other products and services or online surveys. In order to provide our services to you, we may ask you for contact information (such as name and email address), financial information (account or credit card numbers), mailing address, phone number, title, company name, and/or demographic information (including zip/postal code and age).
