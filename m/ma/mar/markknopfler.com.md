We are permitted to process your personal data if it is based on our ‘legitimate interests’ i.e. we have good, sensible, practical reasons for processing your personal data which is in the interests of MarkKnopfler.com. To do so, we have considered the impact on your interests and rights, and have placed appropriate safeguards to ensure that the intrusion on your privacy is reduced as much as possible.

You can object to processing that we carry out on the grounds of legitimate interests. See the section headed “Your Rights ” to find out how.

It is necessary for our performance of the contract you have agreed to enter with us. If you do not provide your personal data to us, we will not be able to carry out our obligations under the terms of your contract.

Our main rule is not to keep your data for longer than we need to in order to meet all the purposes we included in the section “Why do we process your personal data?” To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.

For example, if you are a member, we will keep your data for the time your membership lasts; then, we will keep that data if we need it to comply with a legal obligation or for research or statistics purposes, but if we do not need all the data you provided at first instance, we will delete the remaining data.
