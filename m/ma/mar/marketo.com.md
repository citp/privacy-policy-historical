Marketo, Inc. and its Affiliates (" **Marketo** " or " **We** ") know that you care about how the information we receive from you is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes Marketo’s privacy practices in relation to information that we collect through websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “ **Domains** ”), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices that link to this Privacy Policy (the “ **Apps** ”), through our social media pages and apps located at <https://www.facebook.com/Marketo>, <https://twitter.com/marketo>, <https://plus.google.com/+marketo> and [https://www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/) (collectively, the “ **Social Media Pages** ”), and other services provided by us both online and offline; as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Domains, the Apps and the Social Media Pages, the “ **Sites** ”). “ **You** ” or a “ **user** ” refers to any individual who visits or otherwise uses the Sites. By using the Sites, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Marketo does not own or control, or to individuals that Marketo does not employ or manage. 

This Privacy Policy also does not apply to information that we receive or handle on behalf of our subscribers in our role as a service provider, such as information that we receive through the Marketo Marketing Automation Software Services or other Marketo services, including any apps we make available for use by Services subscribers (collectively, the “ **Services** ”). Such information is governed by the terms of the applicable services agreement, rather than this Privacy Policy.

  * **Personal Information. “Personal Information”** is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including: name, title, company name, job function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, or email address. If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  * **Other Information. “Other Information”** is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include, for instance, browser and device information; App usage data; information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies; demographic information and other information provided by you; or aggregated information. We use this information to facilitate our operation of the Sites and for other purposes described below.

  * **IP Address:** Your “ **IP Address”** is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. Marketo uses IP Addresses to calculate usage levels of the Sites, help diagnose problems with its servers, administer the Sites, and monitoring the regions from which you navigate to Marketo’s Sites.
