# Marketleap Privacy Policy - Compliant with the World's Most Stringent Standards

Marketleap Privacy Policy

Marketleap is a leading provider of marketing technology solutions that protects Internet users' privacy. Our architecture was designed in anticipation of privacy concerns, and was engineered from the ground up to be compliant with the world's most stringent privacy standards. For this reason, we do not maintain, share or sell any personally identifiable data or anonymous user profile information. 

**Strict Anonymity**  
Other than instances where we have a relationship with a Web user, Marketleap does not know or maintain the names, telephone numbers, home addresses or e-mail addresses of Internet users to whom we deliver advertisements on behalf of our clients. We collect data for reports on clients' campaign performance (e.g., aggregate number of impressions delivered, number of click-throughs, etc.) to enable Marketleap and our clients to analyze and optimize their online campaigns. For general reporting purposes on Marketleap's overall ad serving performance and capacity, we may report the total number of advertisements delivered on behalf of all clients for a specific time period, with no reference to individual clients or campaigns.

**Web Site Privacy Policies**  
Our clients retain the sole and exclusive right to use any data, which they have obtained through explicit permission from an Internet user, for example, if a customer provides an e-mail address to receive information and updates. We rely on our clients' consumer privacy policies, as well as the privacy practices of the publisher sites included in each campaign.

We urge consumers to check the privacy policy of a site before they do business with that site regarding:

  1. What personal information is collected about a Web user 
  2. How that information is used 
  3. With whom the information may be shared 
  4. What options are available to Web users regarding the accumulation, use and distribution of the information 
  5. What security procedures are in place to protect the data 
  6. How a Web user can correct inaccuracies in the data

**Cookies**  
In order to measure and report information to advertisers, such as the number of people who see their ads ("reach") and the number of times people see the ad ("frequency"), Marketleap sets a "cookie" which is a small file that is stored in a Web user's hard drive. Cookies cannot read information from the user's hard drive, rather they allow sites and advertisers to track advertising effectiveness and to ensure that viewers don't receive the same ads repeatedly. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to identify any user if the user does not provide any personally identifiable information. They can be used to allow personalization features such as stock portfolio tracking, targeted news stories, etc. 

**E-mail and children**  
Our clients must ensure that they will comply with all laws and regulations concerning any e-mail addresses that are protected by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). If our clients have e-mail programs for children under 13 years old, the clients must guarantee that they have verifiable, parental consent that is in full compliance with COPPA regulations. 

We urge consumers to check the e-mail privacy policy of a company before they participate in that company's program regarding:

  * What personal information is collected about a Web user 
  * How that information is used 
  * With whom the information may be shared 
  * What options are available to Web users regarding the accumulation, use and distribution of the information 
  * What security procedures are in place to protect the data 
  * How a Web user can correct inaccuracies in the data
