###  Overview

This Privacy Policy governs your use of this Coaching Cognition, LLC website. It describes what information we collect from you; what cookies are used and how they are used; how your information is utilized; who is collecting your information; with whom your information may be shared; the types of security precautions in place to protect against loss, misuse, or alteration of your information; how we protect children's privacy; and other details you may want to know about your privacy at our website. 

Please note that our privacy practices are subject to change from time to time. Please visit this page periodically to ensure you follow the most current version of this Privacy Policy. All amended terms will be effective after being posted on our website.

###  What Personally Identifiable Information do we collect?

The primary purpose of collecting information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, effective, and personalized experience and to fulfill the transactions you undertake here. We only collect information about you that we consider necessary to achieve this purpose.

Generally, we collect information in three ways. Some information is gathered when you access secure areas within our website. This may include your name, email address, street address, and phone number. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. We may also collect personal information when you contact us with questions or feedback. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence or conversation to better serve you going forward. 

Finally, you also will have to provide us with credit card and other payment information necessary to complete a payment from you. We use a third party to process and verify credit cards for billing purposes. This requires us to share your name, credit card number, expiration date and billing address with the credit card processing company. When processing a payment transaction we will also obtain information regarding the amount of the payment and other transaction data. We may transfer or disclose this payment information to a third party only to the extent necessary in order to complete the payment processing. 

###  What are "cookies" and how do we use them?

Data collection devices, such as "cookies," are used to store, and sometimes track, information about you. Generally, these cookies help provide personalized services and promote trust and safety. A cookie is a small file containing a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and placed on your computer's hard drive to assist us in providing our services. All pages on the website where you are prompted to login or that are customizable request that you accept cookies. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any code or virus. Most cookies are "session cookies," and are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. No personally identifiable information is collected with the cookies that we place. 

More specifically, we use cookies to remind us of who you are and to access your account information in order to deliver to you a more personalized service. We also use cookies, along with IP addresses, to measure your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on our website a better one. We may also use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our website.
