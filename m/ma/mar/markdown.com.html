<b><center>Markdown.com LLC Privacy Policy</center></b><br>
<font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1">
Markdown.com LLC is strongly committed to protecting your privacy. The purpose of this document is to inform our users what 
information we collect and how and why we use information that we collect from people who use the Markdown.com LLC site and/or e-mail alert service. 
<p><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1">
The Markdown.com LLC <a href="antispam.cfm"> Anti-Spam policy</a> is incorporated into this privacy policy by reference.
</font></p><p><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1"><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1">
We will collect your IP address upon entry into our site. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to 
administer our website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information. 
<br><br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="2">
<b>Why We Ask For Personal Information</b> 
<br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1">
When visitors to the Markdown.com LLC web site sign up for an account to start receiving our e-mail alerts, we ask them to tell us a little 
about themselves. Specifically, we ask for the user's e-mail address via a registration page. We do this so that we can e-mail our Markdown Alerts
to subscribers; we feel this is a vital part of our service and thus find it necessary to ask for user e-mails. We request information from you, 
including your e-mail address and preferences, so that, in the future, we can target our users with the deals that will most likely be of interest to them. 
We also may use subscribers' e-mails to contact users and provide updates regarding Markdown.com LLC and to send user promotional material and 
information provided to us by our business partners (this is sent only if the user has told us that this is acceptable during the sign-up phase by "opting-in" to
these types of announcements). Users may, at any time, opt out of receiving future mailings by accessing their account or visiting http://www.markdown.com/cancel.cfm.
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for internal analysis and to share with other companies the profile of 
our customers. Only the user's email address is required information to receive the e-mail alerts. Any additional fields on the registration form are 
optional and will not affect whether or not you will receive the newsletter (but will affect whether or not you are admitted as a full-member and are
eligible to earn credits and share in the revenue of the Company).  Finally, we may, and you authorize us to, disclose any information about you to law 
enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.   
<br><br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="2">
<b>Third-Party Affiliates</b> 
<br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1">
Markdown.com LLC partners with many companies to help support our free services.  The Company will not share or sell to third parties any individual information users provide us.  Markdown.com LLC may share non-personal aggregate, 
or summary, information regarding its subscribers with partners or other third parties.  On occassion, we may authorize these third parties to send
approved offers to our opt-in subscribers that we feel may be of interest to them.  Users may opt-out of receiving these types
of announcements during the registration process or at any other time simply by e-mailing Markdown.com LLC at the "suppport@markdown.com" address.  In addition, we occassionally 
send information for advertisers in our own e-mails.  We may also share aggregate information with third parties, in order to 
tell them more about our users. For example, we may tell potential advertisers that 25 percent of our users are between the ages of 18 and 30 
(this statistic is an example only, not a real statistic and we occasionally conduct voluntary e-mail surveys of our users to acquire these facts).
Users may choose to purchase services from other companies that are publicized through Markdown.com LLC.  This privacy policy does not apply to 
information users give to these other companies. Any information users give to another company is governed by the rules of that company's privacy 
policy that may be different than Markdown.com's. Markdown.com LLC takes no responsibility for information given to other companies; please review 
these companies' privacy policies prior to your purchase if you're concerned.  
<br><br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="2">
<b>Cookies</b> 
<br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1">
The first time you log into your member account at Markdown.com, we will provide you with a "cookie".  This is a small file that resides
on your computer and allows you to be recognized by our service when you return.  Users can disable cookies within their system at any time
and will not see any material change in the site content.  In addition, we use an outside ad company to display ads on our site and these ads may or may not 
contain cookies.  Cookies received with ads are collected by the advertising company, and we do not have access to this information. Some customer 
data (in aggregate form only) is shared with the advertising companies.  Because all areas of the Markdown.com LLC site are free, and since a 
significant portion of our revenue comes from advertising, the use of cookies to help manage our advertising system is crucial to us.
<br><br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="2">
<b>Security</b> 
<br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1">
Access to private and confidential data is limited to only those employees with a specific need to retrieve this information. Each staff member with a need 
for such information employs their own user ID and password to access the data. System administration staff enforces a minimum password length and advises 
that special characters are included in all passwords.  
To ensure the utmost in security, internal reviews of the ecurity measures are conducted on a regular basis in addition to a formal semi-annual review. 

<br><br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="2">
<b>Choice/Opt-Out </b>
<br><font face="tahoma,arial,sans-serif" size="1">
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future communications from us. This site gives users the option for removing their 
information from our database to stop receiving future communications and no longer receive our service. If you are a full-member (i.e., you have a 
password) Visit <a href="mainlogin.cfm"> http://www.markdown.com/mainlogin.cfm</a> and

<b>Privacy Policy Changes</b>
