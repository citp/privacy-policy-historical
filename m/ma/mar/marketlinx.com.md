We are not responsible for third-party use of information.

A cookie is an element of data that an Internet site can send to your browser. Cookies are stored on your computer. We may share information about you that we collect through a cookie with third-parties who help us analyze Website data, in accordance with the law. 

On our Website we use the following types of cookies:

**(a) Strictly necessary cookies** \- These cookies are essential to enable the user to navigate around the Website securely and to provide the user with services they have specifically requested.

For more information about how Google Analytics uses your information please click [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245).

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. If, however, you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Website.  

We may also include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," in our web pages and email messages. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, and to count how many emails that we sent were actually opened or how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

We may also use embedded scripts on the Website. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deleted or deactivated thereafter.

If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed by the provider of the Social Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references the Website (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with CoreLogic in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on the Website in accordance with the terms of the third party website or service. Also, both CoreLogic and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Website and the third party site or service. The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices.

**7\. Website Security**

We maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. We provide information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other businesses or persons for the purposes of processing such information on our behalf, some or all of which may store your information on servers located outside of the United States.

**8\. California Privacy Rights**

When California customers provide personal information to a business, they have the right to request certain disclosures if that business shares personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Once per calendar year the customer may request that the business provide a list of companies with which it shares personal information for those companies' direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories of personal information that the business shares. CoreLogic generally does not sell products or services directly to individual California consumers. However, if we engage in such contact, you may request information about our compliance with this law by contacting us.

Any such inquiry must include "California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address or mail address.

Our Site is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not intentionally or knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from children under the age of 16 and we request that individuals under the age of 16 do not submit any personal information on the Website. If we learn that we have received identifying information from a user under the age of 16, we will delete this information.

**10\. Third Party Websites**

There may be hyperlinks on the Website to other websites or locations that are operated and controlled by third parties (" **Third Party Websites** ").

**12\. Annex - Processing of Personal Data (Residents of the EEA, Switzerland and UK)**

CoreLogic provides additional information to its EEA, Switzerland and UK based users to comply with data protection laws.

**_12.1 What is personal data?_**

“ **Personal data** ” is information about you (a “ **data subject** ”) the use of which is governed by applicable data protection laws. It will include any information from which you can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as your name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or other information about your identity. Most information collected about you on the Website will constitute personal data.

**_12.2 Who is responsible for your personal data?_**

If you use our Website, the data controller is CoreLogic Solutions Limited, 1st floor, 39 Houndsditch, London EC3A 7DB. CoreLogic Solutions Limited is registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK (registration number Z6322218).

**_12.3 What is the legal basis for processing your personal data?_**

On some occasions, we process your personal data with your consent, for example, when you agree to receive our newsletter or to deal with your enquiries.

On other occasions, we process your personal data when we need to do this in order to fulfil a contract with you, such as granting you access to our online services.

We also process your personal data when it is in our legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights. For example, we may process your personal data in our legitimate interests to ensure that our Website and services are provided efficiently and in an user-friendly and personalised manner taking into account user feedback, data and profiles, unless consent is required for any such processing under applicable law. We will process personal data to ensure the security of our business and the information of our users, and to ensure the proper and efficient administration of our business. You may contact us for further information.

Finally, we will process your personal data where we are required to do this by law. For example, where we have to fulfil anti-money laundering requirements or disclose information under a court order. 

**_12.4 Data transfers_**

Personal data that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Personal data which you provide may be transferred to our group companies, commercial partners, suppliers or agents located outside your country as set out above. We will ensure adequate protection of personal data transferred outside of your country as required under applicable laws. For example, if you are located in the EEA, Swiss or in the UK, we may enter into [model clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en) with the recipient. You may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your personal data in these circumstances.

In addition, personal data that you submit for publication on the Website will be published on the internet and may be available, via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others.

**_12.5 How long does CoreLogic keep personal data?_**

CoreLogic keeps your personal data for only as long as required to provide you with the necessary Website content and services and to carry out the processing set out in this Privacy Notice, and in line with its obligation under applicable law. This means that we will generally not keep your personal data for longer than six years following your last interaction with us, and the actual retention period will often be shorter. You may contact us for further information.

**_12.6 Your rights_**

Data subjects may ask us for a copy of their personal data, to correct it, erase it or to transfer it to other organisations at their request. Data subjects also have rights to object to some processing including profiling and, where we have asked for their consent to process the data subject’s personal data, to withdraw this consent. In particular, data subjects have the right to object to direct marketing at any time. Where a data subject withdraws their consent, this will not affect the legitimacy of the processing conducted prior to your request.  Where we process personal data because we have a legitimate interest in doing so (as explained above), the data subject has a right to object to this.

These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal data.

Please use the contact information set out in our Contacting Us section above. We will aim to acknowledge your enquiries within 72 hours and respond within one month, unless otherwise required by law.

We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your personal data. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority. 

**13\. Changes to this Statement**

CoreLogic may from time to time and without prior notice revise this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be effective immediately when the revised Policy is posted on the Website, unless stated otherwise. We will not, however, use your personal information in a manner materially different than what was stated in the Privacy Policy posted on the Website at the time your personal information was collected unless we receive your consent.
