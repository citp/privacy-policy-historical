# Mara Pets Games - Free Virtual Pet Site, Online Games & Dress Up Games

**Privacy Policy**

To ensure this website is a safe and fun place for all we ensure that all online information is secure at all times. The site has a large number of online child players and therefore we take care to make sure that the content of the site is always safe for them. Any information gathered from you through this website will never be disclosed to any third party. This is includes Marapets staff, as all personal information is kept hidden from staff. 

Children under the age of 13 do not disclose any personal information about themselves. They are not even asked of an email address, just simply a username, password and their gender, so that they can be uniquely identified in the game of Marapets. These are only used for them to keep their account on the site secure. ALL information can be removed as requested at any time, simply open a Support Ticket via the Contact Us link at the bottom of every page, and a staff member will do so. 

Marapets asks users 13 years and older to provide a valid first (and optional last name), valid e-mail address, birth date, gender, and country of location. All users can change or remove their information upon registration. 

Children under 13 can only have their accounts changed to an over 13 account upon the request of their parents, informing us that they have permission to do so. In such a case, the parents need to print out a Parental Consent form ([ **click here**](https://web.archive.org/web/20100621115107id_/http%3A//www.marapets.com/coppa.html)) and fill it in. They can then scan it and email to marapets@gmail.com or fax it (fax number coming soon). 

All information we collect and store is for gaming purposes only. Personal information of those 13 and over are, your email address for you to recover your password, your gender to identify you at the forums, date of birth to track which age groups use the site, your ip address to stop cheating with multiple accounts. 

For those who have verified their account via email as an over 13 year old account, have full access to the site and its features. Marasites, MaraMail and MaraJournals are free services. Any content you submit is optional and voluntary. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. Any files uploaded, websites or journals created on the Marasites, MaraUploads or MaraJournals system are by nature of being hosted, for the public and are thus publicly accessible. MaraMail is a free beta emailing service from Marapets which is to be used for chat only. Although all data from emails is encrypted from public and staff viewing, we will not take any responsibility for any loss via use of our email service. We therefore request that you do not use it for any online services which require personal information to be disclosed and espeically not for any site that could result in a loss of money or belongings - such as for Paypal, Ebay, Amazon, etc. MaraMail stores, processes and maintains your messages, contact lists and other data related to your account in order to provide the service to you. 

Participation in the Marapets Website is not based upon information collected. 

We have a strict policy against spyware and adware and popup advertisements. All of our advertising will be suitable for all ages, using Google Adsense targetted advertisements. 

When visitors enter the site and members sign up to the site information such as computer operating system, IP address and web browser. This is only for research purposes to ensure that the site works its best with all users. If you would like your account or information removed, simply open a Support Ticket via the Contact Us link at the bottom of every page, and a staff member will do so. 

With respect to security, our server's physical location maintains a team of on-site security staff 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The security staff works with integrated closed circuit television and card access systems which are monitored from the security post in the main lobby. Staff have very limit access to the site. Only the site operator has full access. All of these are in place to ensure that there is no loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. 

Finally, the site requires 'Session' Cookies to ensure that the game works. These are small text files that are stored on your computer. They keep you logged onto the site by telling our server who you are and what page of the site you last view. It also helps us to determine how many users and guests are online. These cookies can be easily removed using the appropriate options on your web browser. 

We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
