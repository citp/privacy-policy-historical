# MarketSurveys.com - Privacy Statement

We are a survey research company and our use of your information is strictly limited in accordance with the following policies.

We will not send you endless streams of e-mail directing you to complete a survey. You will be notified initially about a newly posted survey, possibly with a limited number of follow-up emails to ensure that you have the opportunity to participate before the survey period ends.

We may obtain your email address from other websites or when you visit our site to join the MarketSurveys.com panel. Because participation in our MarketSurveys.com panel is strictly voluntary, you are free to decide whether or not you wish to participate in any given survey. When you choose to participate in a survey, you provide three types of information that we collect:

> (i) your survey responses concerning products, services or other subjects covered in that survey ("Survey Data"),
> 
> (ii) your demographic profile, such as gender, age, income, geographic area, or other characteristics ("Demographic Data"); and
> 
> (iii) your personally identifiable information, such as your email address and other identifying information that you choose to provide, such as your physical address, first or last name, phone number, or other contact information ("Personally Identifiable Information").

Survey Data and Demographic Data are tabulated collectively using data from all respondents, and are provided to research clients only in aggregate statistical form. We do not provide research clients with your Personally Identifiable Information.

We may enter into business relationships with third parties that make available prizes, sweepstakes, and other offers to our panelists that, if accepted by a panelist, require that we share Personally Identifiable Information with the third party providing the offer. The IP address of any panelist accepting such offers, as well as date and time of acceptance, may also be shared with the third parties associated with their offers.

In addition, a third party that conducts online surveys could acquire the MarketSurveys.com business or assets of the business, for the purpose of enabling the acquiror to conduct surveys with panel members. If the MarketSurveys business, the panel, or a part of the panel is acquired by such a third party, Personally Identifiable Information would be transferred to the acquiror.

Panelists who want to change their Personally Identifiable Information related to their panel membership may click on this link - [Member's Section](https://web.archive.org/members/account.phtml?PHPSESSID=559c6575a9db77abfb0d8c6bdc9c380f) -, enter your email address and password and click "Sign In". You will then have access to change your Personally Identifiable Information related to your panel membership.

MarketSurveys.com reserves the right to change its privacy policy at its sole discretion. MarketSurveys.com panelists will be informed of any such change by posting it on the MarketSurveys.com website. The effective date of any change of privacy policy will be clearly marked.

You may choose to leave the panel at any time. Simply inform us with an email via the "contact us" link with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject box.

The privacy policy set out above is effective as of August 4, 2004, and will apply to all information obtained after that date. Information that was obtained prior to August 4, 2004 will also be subject to the policies above, unless the visitor elects to unsubscribe prior to September 5, 2004. You may unsubscribe as explained above, at any time.
