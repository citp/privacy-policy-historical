**Targeting or Advertising**

| 

These cookies collect information about your browsing habits and inferred interests in order to make advertising more relevant to you. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advert, as well as to measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.

They remember the other websites that you visit and this information is shared with third-party organisations, for example advertisers.   
  
**Social Media**

These cookies allow you to share what you’ve been doing on our Site with social media organisations such as Facebook and Twitter. These cookies are not within our control. Please refer to the privacy policies of these organisations for how their cookies work.  
  
Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.

We may use cookies:

(i)         to collect anonymised data on users behaviour on the site. We may also capture what site a user has come from and what site they go to and also some **demogra** phic data (e.g. the user’s location) and we may use that data to analyse user behaviour across multiple sites; 

(ii)         to categorise pools of users (on an anonymised basis) based on demographic and/or behavioural data and use this to, (1) target our advertising to cookie-ed users on third party websites and Universal Music websites, and (2) use that data to allow targeted third party advertising to categorised cookie-ed users either in respect of advertising placement UMG has bought/placed and targeted to users on behalf of third parties  or in respect of advertising bought/placed by third parties and targeted to cookie pools UMG has "sold" to these third parties.

Our Sites may use Google AdSense to publish advertisements. When you view or click on an advert a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other websites.

**_Web Beacons and other Tracking Technologies_**

We, or our third party partners, may employ a software technology called web beacons (also known as web bugs, clear gifs or pixels) which helps us understand what content is effective, for example by counting the number of users who have visited these pages. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons  are embedded invisibly on web pages. We, or our third party partners, may tie the information gathered by web beacons to the other information we collect about you.
