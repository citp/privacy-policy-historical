# Privacy | Marvel

### Marvel was built for designers, by designers. Quite simply, we know how critical it is to ensure the privacy, rights and security of your work and we do everything we can to make sure that you are protected.

At Marvel we have a few fundamental principles: 

  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason).
  * We never access any files in your Dropbox account unless you choose to use it for a prototype on Marvel.
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products internally, or protect our rights.
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our prototyping products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Marvel Prototyping collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Marvel Prototyping's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Marvel Prototyping's visitors use its website. From time to time, Marvel Prototyping may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Marvel Prototyping also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and people viewing prototype URLs. Marvel Prototyping only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Marvel prototype's choose to interact with Marvel Prototyping in ways that require Marvel Prototyping to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Marvel Prototyping gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at marvelapp.com to provide their name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Marvel Prototyping — by purchasing access to our Pro account for example — are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Marvel Prototyping collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Marvel Prototyping. Marvel Prototyping does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Marvel Prototyping may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites. For instance, Marvel Prototyping may monitor the most popular prototypes on the Marvelapp.com site to see how our server perform under the strain or analytics to measure where users spend their time in the app. Marvel Prototyping may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Marvel Prototyping does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Marvel Prototyping discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Marvel Prototyping's behalf or to provide services available at Marvel Prototyping's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Marvel Prototyping's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Marvel Prototyping will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Marvel Prototyping discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Marvel Prototyping believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Marvel Prototyping, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Marvel Prototyping website and have supplied your email address, Marvel Prototyping may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Marvel Prototyping and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Marvel Prototyping takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Marvel Prototyping may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
