# Privacy Policy - Dow Jones

**Effective Date: October 19, 2017**

### 1\. INTRODUCTION

Dow Jones & Company, Inc., and its subsidiaries ("Dow Jones") want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you because we respect your concerns about privacy, and we want to maintain your trust.

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources, including in connection with our websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), widgets, conferences, events, and electronic newsletters or communications (collectively the "Dow Jones Services") that link to this Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict between this Policy and a Dow Jones Services corporate subscription agreement, the Dow Jones Services corporate subscription agreement will take precedence.

This Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it. It also describes generally Dow Jones' practices for handling Other Information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage) collected through our Dow Jones Services or from a third party to the extent such information is associated with a particular device, user or user account. We also describe the measures we take to protect the information, your options for choice and access, and how you can contact us about privacy practices. As described more fully below, we share information with our subsidiaries, and affiliated companies ("Dow Jones Affiliates"), for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. A list of Dow Jones subsidiaries and Affiliates is available in annual reports accessible [here](http://investors.newscorp.com/sec-filings). By using the Dow Jones Services, you acknowledge you have read and accept this Privacy Policy.

Your decision to use the Dow Jones Services and provide your Personal Data is voluntary. We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of Personal Data are requested. You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see Other Information below, or our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20180630051214id_/https://www.dowjones.com/privacy-policy/cookies-policy/), for more information), but that may limit the services Dow Jones is able to provide to you.

The Dow Jones Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect Personal Data from, minors under 16 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide Personal Data through the Dow Jones Services.

The information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media service. When you access the Dow Jones Services through social media services or when you connect a Dow Jones Service to social media services, you are authorizing Dow Jones to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Dow Jones is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties, and once you leave the Dow Jones Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable third party privacy policy.
