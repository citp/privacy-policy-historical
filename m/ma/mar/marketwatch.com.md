Sites Subject to this Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how Dow Jones & Company, Inc. and its affiliates (“Dow Jones”) will treat the personal information received about you when you visit MarketWatch (home page at MarketWatch.com), and BigCharts (home page at Big Charts.com) (hereafter referred to collectively as the "Services").

Dow Jones publishes other web sites that have separate privacy policies and may be accessible via links on the Services. The Services also may include links to third party web sites, which also have their own privacy policies. Please remember that when you visit these other web sites, even from links located on the Services, this privacy policy does not apply.

Information We Collect

**We Collect:** When you register for membership or other benefits, and at other times, we will collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, address, e-mail address and credit-card information, and other information such as your age, facts about your computers, profession and investing habits and similar information. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen.

**Surveys:** We may conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate. 

**Web Site Usage Information:** We automatically collect IP addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit the Services. This information helps us, among other things, evaluate how you use and navigate our web sites. 

How We Use Information Collected

We may use information in the following ways: 

  * For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to process, validate and verify your registration. 
  * To send you notifications about your accounts or transactions with us and to otherwise contact you with information that we believe will be of interest to you. 
  * To notify you about our products, services and special offers or those of our advertisers. 
  * To enhance or develop features, products and services. 
  * To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. 
  * To personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. 



Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Dow Jones, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information or you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us. Subject to the foregoing, we may allow select companies to send you materials about their products and services.

We may combine the information that we collect from you on the Services with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products, services and web sites or information we collect from third parties.

We may hire other companies to perform services including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of the Services, sending e-mail, fulfilling purchase requests, delivering ads, and auditing. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. 

We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Terms of Service and other rights (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights) or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate in connection with or as the result of a change in ownership of all or a portion of the Services as the result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company. We also may disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.
