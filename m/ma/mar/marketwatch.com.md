# Privacy Policy

MarketWatch.com, Inc. Privacy Policy

Scope

This Privacy Policy covers MarketWatch.com's treatment of personally identifiable information that we collect when you are on the cbs.marketwatch.com site and when you use our services. This policy also covers our treatment of any personally identifiable information that our business partners share with us.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that MarketWatch.com does not own or control, or to individuals that MarketWatch.com does not employ or manage, including operators of sites to which you may link from the cbs.marketwatch.com website.

What information do we gather?

The only individually identifiable information that we collect about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration or when responding to offers from MarketWatch.com or from our business partners.

We also collect information about aggregate site usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, and are not associated with your personal information.

Why do we ask for personal information about you?

Our ultimate goal at MarketWatch.com is to provide you with a comprehensive set of actionable financial news, data and tools to assist you in making decisions about your investments. Many of the features on our site will be more beneficial to you if you customize the way they work and what they contain, and then can return to your personalized version each time you come back to the site. Personal Portfolios are the most obvious example of this type of feature. To support this personalization we need to be able to identify your account from session to session. This requires that you provide us with some individually identifiable information about yourself. Your user name, password and email address allow us to differentiate you from other users and maintain your personalized version of the site. They also allow us to contact you about developments and new products on the site.

Other information that we ask you to share with us allows us to improve the site and still keep it free. Aggregate demographic information about our users is valuable to our advertisers as it provides them with more effective channels for reaching potential customers. Without advertising support, we could not keep the site free for your use.

We may share aggregate information with our partners and advertisers. We will not share your personally identifiable information with any third party, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you have consented by "opting in" to being contacted by MarketWatch.com, its partners and advertisers, and other third parties, or we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy so that you can then choose to opt out. We will give you a way to "opt out" of being contacted by Marketwatch.com.

In short, the information you provide us can help us to understand how to make our site more convenient and useful to our audience.

Opting-Out. Here is how it works at MarketWatch.com: 

We do not share personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you "opt in" to having your information shared with third parties, or we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy so that you can then choose to opt out. It's that simple.

When we ask you for personally identifiable information, we will tell you if we intend to share it with others. We will provide you with a way to tell us that you don't want us to share the information or if you don't want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, services, and offerings from Marketwatch.com and/or any third parties. We will also provide you with a way to update your personally identifiable information that you share with us during registration. Once you have "opted in" and agreed that your information may be shared with third parties or you have responded to an offer by any third party on the MarketWatch.com website, MarketWatch.com can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information that has been transferred to such third parties or opt you out of such third parties so that you no longer receive their promotional and/or marketing information. Instead, you must either contact that third party or refer to their privacy policy to update your personally identifiable information or to let them know that you no longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about their products, services, or offerings.

How does MarketWatch.com use cookies?

MarketWatch.com uses cookies to facilitate the login process for you across multiple applications on the site. When you register with MarketWatch.com, we assign a unique user id to you, and we place a cookie on your computer which will remind our system of that user id in other areas of the site, or next time you visit the site. This cookie allows you to access all of your personalized areas of the site without having to log on multiple times. If you choose to log out, this cookie we set in registration will be deleted and we will then set another cookie like it on your computer next time you log in.

Please note: Nothing in a cookie allows us to identify you individually. Your computer is assigned a number and that number is tracked using the cookie. This number is only meaningful in the context of our secure database system and your personalized version of MarketWatch.com.

We also use cookies to log your activity on the site. Everything we learn from these logs will be used to enrich your experience on our site. It will help us understand what you like and don't like, so we can focus our energies more effectively and provide you with better financial news and data.

Double Click, our advertising service provider, also sets a cookie on your computer. Again there is nothing in this cookie that relates to you as an individual. It is only a tracking mechanism on your machine. See Double Click's [ On Privacy](http://www.doubleclick.com/nf/general/onpriset.htm) page to learn more about how they use cookies. In addition, some companies offering products or services through the MarketWatch.com site may also use their own cookies.

What information do we gather? 

The only individually identifiable information that we collect about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration or when responding to offers from MarketWatch.com or from our business partners. As stated earlier, this information will be closely protected and used for internal purposes only, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you have consented by "opting in" to being contacted by MarketWatch.com, its partners and advertisers, and other third parties, or we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy so that you can then choose to opt out. We will never willfully release your personal information to any third party without providing you notice unless: you direct us to enter you in a contest; sign you up for a service which is sponsored by one of our partners; you otherwise "opt in" to have your information shared with third parties; we respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; we find your actions on our website violate our Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services; or we transfer your information in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether assets, stock, or otherwise), of all or a portion of a business of MarketWatch.com. 

We also collect information about aggregate site usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, not on your individual activities.

Changes to the MarketWatch.com Privacy Policy

MarketWatch.com may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent notice in our privacy policy or in other locations on our website or by sending you an email to inform you of our updated privacy policy.

The Bottom Line

Sometimes we want personal information from you so that we, our partners and our advertisers can send you some material we think might be of interest to you.

We promise never to be sneaky about it getting this information from you. We always tell you up front what we're going to do with the answers, and we always give you a chance to say "no thanks."
