We use analysis cookies to improve and optimize the quality of our websites and their content.

Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you.

You can prevent the storage of cookies by using a corresponding setting on your browser software; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all the features of this website fully.

**Retargeting and Remarketing**

Retargeting or remarketing refers to technologies in which users who have previously visited a certain website are shown appropriate advertising even after leaving this website. For this purpose, it is necessary to recognize Internet users beyond their own website, for which purpose cookies of the corresponding service providers are used. In addition, previous usage behavior is considered. For example, if some user views certain products, they may later display these or similar products as advertisements on other websites. It is personalized advertising that is adapted to the needs of each user. It is not necessary for this personalized advertisement to be identified beyond the recognition of the user. The data used for the retargeting or remarketing will therefore not be merged with other data.

We use such technologies to display ads on the Internet. We use third-party providers to deliver such ads. We use, among other things, offers from Google, which allows an automatic display of interesting products for the Internet user. This function is implemented by cookies. Cookies for Google Remarketing and Google AdWords Conversion Tracking can be managed in your browser settings.

**Social Media**

On our websites, you will find links to the social network Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn as well as to our YouTube channels. The links are indicated by the respective logo of the provider.

Clicking on the links opens the corresponding social media pages for which this Privacy Policy does not apply. For details of the applicable provisions, please refer to the respective Privacy Policies of each provider. 

**Facebook Custom Audiences**

Tower Websites use the Facebook Customer's remarketing feature "Custom Audiences" ("Facebook"). This allows users of the website to be shown interest-based advertisements ("Facebook Ads") as part of their visit to the social network Facebook or other websites that also use the process. We are interested in showing you advertisements that are of interest to you to make our online offers more interesting to you.

Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Facebook server. We have no influence on the extent and further use of the data collected using this tool by Facebook and therefore inform you that according to our knowledge: By integrating Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online services or have clicked on an ad from us. If you are registered with a service of Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Facebook or have not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will find out and store your IP address and other identifying features.

Disabling the "Facebook Custom Audiences" feature is available to logged-in users at <https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_.>

**LinkedIn**

Tower uses LinkedIn Ads and Marketing Solutions. On some occasions, we may also use the Audience Network feature for sponsored content campaigns to deliver our creatives on third-party sites beyond the LinkedIn feed.
