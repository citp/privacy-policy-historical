# Marketwire Privacy Policy

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.

We use this information to help diagnose problems with our service and to administer our website. For example, your IP address may be used to help identify you and your account information and to gather broad demographic information.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your account. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to you.

We may share aggregate information about our users with third parties such as advertisers.

Marketwire may also disclose your personal information, the contents of your communications and/or your contact and financial information if required to do so by law, with your consent or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary:

  1. To conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on Marketwire;
  2. To protect and defend the rights or property of Marketwire or others; or
  3. To assist, under exigent circumstances, in the investigation of securities law violations or other investigations. 



It is possible that as we continue to develop our business, Marketwire might be acquired. In such a transaction, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.

The privacy practices of companies who provide services or ads through our site are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact those companies directly for more information about their privacy practices.
