##### 6\. Information Collection Practices

We collect a variety of information as listed below as needed to operate our business, and for the legitimate interest of our business, including for marketing purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our website and other publicly facing services and applications are primarily intended for interaction in the business environment. Our information collection practices are focused on the business context, and the careful and limited identification of leads and prospects for our sales efforts.

These data include:

 **Log Data**  
When a user uses, or interacts with our Platform, or clicks on a link that directs the user to our Platform, the user’s browser automatically provides, and we automatically collect and store, certain information about the user’s device (computer, tablet, smartphone) and the user’s activities. This includes:

  *  **Preferences and settings:** time zone, language, and character size.
  *  **Identifiers:** IP address
  *  **Technical information:** type of device, operating system name and version, device manufacturer, browser information (type, version), screen resolution.
  *  **Coarse geographic information:** geographic location derived from the IP address.



We collect this data for the proper operation of our Platform. Until the user becomes a “lead” this data cannot be linked to a specific individual.

 **Traffic Data**  
Data generated by the use of the Platform also include:

  *  **Information about use of the Platform:** date stamp, URL of the visited page, URL of the last webpage visited before visiting our Platform or a website using our Platform. URL of the last webpage visited before visiting our Service.
  *  **History of interaction with our webpages:** pages viewed, time spent on a page, click through, clickstream data; queries made, search history, search results selected; comments made, type of service requested, purchases made.



We collect this data to understand how our Platform is used and to create statistics on the use of our Platform. Until the user becomes a “lead” this data cannot be linked to a specific individual

 **Lead Data**  
If a visitor interacts with us, for example, to inquire about a product or service, the visitor becomes a lead. In these cases, we will collect information provided to us through the form or questionnaire used to make the request, or the contact or other information provided at a trade show or industry event. The information is provided directly and voluntarily by the individual. Depending on the circumstances, the information may include:

  * First and Last Name
  * Name of the business
  * Email address
  * Street address, city, state, province and/or country
  * Telephone number
  * Website URL
  * Social Media Handles
  * Mobile Number



We collect this data for sales and marketing purposes to allow us to respond to a request from a lead so that we may provide information about our Service.

 **Customer Representative Data**  
When a Customer has purchased the Service, we create an account on our Platform, in the name of the Customer. The Customer has the ability to create one or several accounts. For each authorized Customer Representative allowed to use these accounts, we request:

  * First and Last Name
  * Name of the company for which the Service is purchased
  * Email address
  * Street address, city, state, province and/or country
  * Telephone number
  * Website URL



It may also include, at the individual’s option

Only the minimum amount of information necessary to operate or manage the account is mandatory. The Customer Representative may elect to provide additional information, which we may use to enhance the Service, for example by offering access to social media accounts through the Service.

To access the Customer account, the registrant is required to choose a password.

 **Information the User Makes Public**  
The Platform contains features that allow certain users to upload, post, transmit, display, perform, or distribute content, or other information, including their Personal data. Any information that the user chooses to disclose by means of such features may become public information.

SharpSpring is unable to exercise control over this information once the user has made it public. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal data by means of such features, and you are solely responsible for any uses or misuse of such information.

 **Publicly Available Information**  
We supplement information that we receive directly from the user or the user’s equipment with additional information that is available from public sources, in public records, or other publicly available databases or from information that the user has made public, for example, in tweets or Facebook posts.

 **Payment Information**  
When a Customer pays for the Service, we collect the method of payment, date and amount of the payment. If the Customer pays with a credit card, this information is transmitted directly to our payment processor, and we do not retain the detail of the payment information other than the Transaction ID number. After payment card information is entered, we do not have access to payment card information and disclaim any liability for any loss or compromise of payment card information. When you make a payment, you agree to terms of our payment processor.

In the case of an ongoing relationship, we retain information about the Customer’s payment history as necessary for the administration of the Customer account.

 **Communication from Users**  
When a visitor or lead completes an online form, visits our website or other areas of our Platform (for example on social media), or when a user otherwise contacts us, by email, phone or text, we automatically collect and store certain information about that user and the user’s activities, as we receive from such user, for example:

  * The user’s name and contact information.
  * Information that the user provides to us.
  * The user’s company information, if any.
  * The nature of the communication.
  * The purpose of the interaction, and the action we took in response to the user’s inquiry or request;
  * Any action the user takes upon receipt of such communication (for example, whether the user registers to attend an event that we offer, or request to receive documentation).



The information collected in connection with each type of interaction is retained so that SharpSpring and each user can continue interaction with the requestor for marketing and sales purpose and the promotion of our Service.

 **Communications to Users**  
Unless we are prohibited by applicable law from using cookies and a user has not otherwise consented to our use of cookies, we insert cookies in some of our correspondence with users.

In that case, when we send an email message to a user, our message contains images or links, which when viewed or clicked, will register an event with us that allows us to know whether the user has accessed or declined to open our message. This action may also store a cookie which will allow us to count unique clicks or visits and potentially track the recipient.

This information is needed for our legitimate business purposes, because it helps us understand how the individual reacts to our communications and limit the amount and nature of information provided. We believe that such means are fair, lawful, and proportional to the legitimate interest and needs of our business, and that our methodology fairly addresses each user’s legitimate rights and expectations in view of the context and purpose for the collection and use of the information collected.

The information is collected in connection with our marketing efforts and is retained so that we can continue or elect to stop interaction with the lead.

We do not want to intrude in your busy life or waste your time. If at any time you wish that we cease to communicate with you, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section, or take advantage of the unsubscribe link that you will find in any of our written electronic communications.

 **Surveys and Contests**  
From time-to-time, we invite users to participate in surveys or contests. Participation is voluntary. These surveys are organized for the purposes of our marketing efforts.

When a user participates, we request certain personal data such as name and email address. This is necessary to ensure that responses are categorized properly and are not duplicated

Depending on the nature of the survey or contents, we also use this information to send the survey results to the participants, or, if applicable, to notify contest winners and award prizes.

We use the information obtained from these surveys and contests in aggregate form, for analytics purposes, to understand our market, to monitor site traffic or app usage, or to modify our Platform or our Service to meet the needs or interests of users.

If we use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys, the information collected by the service provider may be subject to both the service provider’s privacy policy and SharpSpring’s. We will provide information about the applicable privacy policies with the Survey rules and will seek your explicit consent to these rules when required by law. You should read the terms of the survey or contest to understand the extent to which the service provider is allowed to use or reuse the information collected.

 **Social Media**  
Our Platform offers integrations with third-party social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. These services collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Platform. They may set a cookie to enable their features to function properly. Social media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.

 _ _Your use of these services is optional. If you elect to use them, you will be deemed to have expressly consented to the collection of personal data by these services according to their terms.__

 **Information we Obtain from Third Parties**  
We receive information from third party data providers including directories. In some cases, such as LinkedIn, the information has manifestly been made public by the individuals who posted their profile on LinkedIn, and we assume that the individuals no longer have a privacy interest in such information, and it can be used for the legitimate interest of SharpSpring in learning about potential Customers.

 **Email Accounts**  
Users may opt-in to use features of the Platform which regularly collect and store the contents of emails from their email accounts, which are hosted by third-party email service providers. This is done for the purpose of providing advanced features of the Platform and is only done at the user’s express direction.

In order to provide these features, the Platform must authenticate with the user’s third-party email accounts. When possible, this is done using OAuth.

For example, the Platform will use OAuth to securely authenticate with a user’s particular email account. Once authenticated, the OAuth authentication, or “bearer” token, is encrypted and stored, and is used on subsequent requests to prove authentication. When OAuth is not possible, we encrypt and store the user’s third-party email account credentials, and thereafter use them to securely authenticate with the third-party email service.

Access to email account authentication tokens and credentials (where applicable), the keys to decrypt this data, and user email content, is limited to only employees who need access to support and develop the Platform and only within the scope of their job responsibilities. The user’s authentication tokens or credentials, and email data, is never shared with third-parties.

For users who authorize and use OAuth with their Gmail account through Google, the use of data obtained through the Platform will comply with Google’s additional Restricted Scopes requirements that are listed in the Google API Services: User Data Policy. The details of the this policy can be found at: [https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional-requirements-for-specific-api-scopes.](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional-requirements-for-specific-api-scopes) As this policy is subject to change based on the needs of Google, it is recommended that users regularly check on updates to the policy at the above attached web address.

##### 7\. How Information is Collected

The information is collected through several different means described below. We believe that such means are fair, lawful, and proportional to the legitimate interest and needs of our business, and that our methodology fairly addresses each user’s legitimate rights and expectations in view of the context and purpose for the collection and use of the information collected.

However, please be assured that we do not want to intrude in your busy life or waste your time. If at any time you wish that we cease any form of collection or processing of information about you, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section.

 **Corporate Reorganization**  
We may transfer users’ information to a third party in case of the reorganization, sale, merger, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, asset or stocks, including in the event of bankruptcy or corporate restructuring.

Any information that a user submits or that is collected after that transfer may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.

##### 11\. Crossborder Transfer of Information

We provide a global Platform and Service. Subject to applicable law, information that we obtain from or about users may be processed or transferred to data centers located throughout the world. The standards and laws that apply to the protection of personal data in these countries might be different from that which is afforded in the country where a user is located.

SharpSpring has chosen to participate in the Privacy Shield program and to certify its adherence to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and their respective Principles and Supplemental Principles (“Principles”). Please see also our EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Policy. [<https://sharpspring.com/legal/us-eu-privacy-notice/>]

 **Security of Personal Data**  
We use commercially reasonable technical, organizational, and administrative safeguards to protect information within our control against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, destruction, processing or disclosure, and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. We believe that these measures are reasonably adapted to the nature of the information in our custody.

We limit access to our users’ personal data to only those employees and third parties who reasonably need access to it to perform the activities attached to their job responsibilities.

However, due to the realities of data security, no security system or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% effective or secure. Thus, we cannot guarantee that any information provided to us or collected by us will not be accessed, hacked, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized parties.

 **Breach of Security  
**In the event that we become aware of a security breach which we believe has resulted, or may result, in the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of non-public personal information of users, we will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable parties of such breach. Such investigation will be without delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement; (ii) measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach; (iii) efforts to identify the individuals affected; and (iv) steps to restore the reasonable integrity of our Platform.

If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us might have been compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately by contacting us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section.

 **Lost or Stolen Information**  
You must promptly notify us if your credit, bank, other financial institution information, username, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will assist you in updating your account details.

We will retain personal data we collect from you where we have justifiable business need to do so, and/or for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law, such as for tax, legal, or accounting purposes.

You can request deletion of your personal data at any time, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.

When we have no justifiable business need to process your personal data, we will either delete it or anonymize it, or if it not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

##### 16\. EU/EEA Residents: Data Subject Rights under the GDPR

Users may contact us, at the address provided in the “How to Contact us” section below, to exercise any of those rights and we will respond with the requested action or information, or will let you know why that right does not apply to you.

 **Right Not to Provide Consent or to Withdraw Consent**  
We may seek to rely on your consent in order to process certain personal data. Where we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent, and the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

##### 17\. California Residents: Rights under California Law

California requires operators of websites or similar services to make certain disclosures to users who reside in California regarding their rights, specifically:

 **Shine the Light**  
Under California law, a business that has an established business relationship with an individual, and has, within the immediately preceding calendar year, disclosed personal data that is primarily used for personal, family or household purposes to third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes, must disclose to its California users, upon request, the identity of any such third party, along with the type of personal data disclosed.

You can contact us to as provided in the “How to Contact Us” section. Please note that under California law, businesses are only required to respond to a user’s request once during any calendar year.

 **Do-Not-Track**  
Some browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. California law requires that we disclose to users how we treat do-not-track requests. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law.

In the meantime, there are technical means to prevent some of the tracking, if any. See Section “Your Advertising Choices.”

Our Platform is not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not solicit or knowingly collect Personal data from such individuals. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section below. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal data from a child under the age of 18, we will take steps to delete such information from our database.
