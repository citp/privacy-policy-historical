We at Market Realist, Inc. (the “Company” or “we”) are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers, and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information supplied by you (“User Information”) when you visit our website (the “Site”).  We take our responsibilities to you seriously and we value your privacy, and accordingly we see it as a principal responsibility to inform you about how we use and protect you User Information.  If you have further questions about our privacy policy, please contact us at privacy@marketrealist.com.

In order to provide you with our content, including Market Realist articles, commentary, market analysis, we may request that you provide us with your first and last name, and e-mail address. We may request that you provide us with additional User Information from time to time.

In the event that you contact us for customer support through the Site, we may also request that you provide additional User Information relevant to the support requested by you.  You are under no obligation to provide such information.  However, we cannot guarantee that we can provide customer support in the event that relevant information related to the use of our products or services is withheld.  We may retain communications relating to customer support, and/or information drawn from such communications, for statistical and/or reference purposes.

In the event that we decide to operate a user forum via the Site, and you decide to participate in that forum, any personal private and/or confidential information that you elect to disclose to other users on the forum shall be disclosed voluntarily and at your own risk.  Such disclosures shall not be considered User Information, and we are not responsible for maintaining the security of any information so disclosed.

In the event that we decide to allow you to create a public profile via the site that is visible to other users, any personal private and/or confidential information that you elect to disclose to other users in your public profile shall be disclosed voluntarily and at your own risk.  Such disclosures shall not be considered User Information, and we are not responsible for maintaining the security of any information so disclosed.

The Company’s web server records visitor IP addresses and domain names for reporting and site usage analysis. This information is reported internally and then purged periodically.

We use cookies to enable you to sign in and to help personalize your experience of the Site. A cookie is a small text file that a web page server places on your hard disk.  A web server assigns cookies uniquely to you and only a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you can read the cookies.  One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.  For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a website, a cookie helps the website to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Using cookies simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation. When you return to the website, you can retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the website’s features that you customized.  You have the ability to accept or decline our cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline some or all cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline all cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of the Site or other websites that depend on cookies.

#### Use and Sharing of User Information

  * Third parties for the purpose of verifying your qualifications to access the Site

We will not provide User Information to third parties used to manage customer information, or with whom we partner to enhance products or services, unless we receive assurances from such third party that it (1) will not use or disclose User Information for purposes of solicitation or direct marketing, and (2) will keep User Information secure using methods comparable to, or more secure than, the security methods used by Company.  However, we do not control third parties, and we assume no liability in the event that a third party breaches its promises regarding confidentiality.  We encourage you to contact us at privacy@marketrealist.com if you suspect that your User Information has been compromised by a third party.

To the extent that you provide User Information to us concerning third parties, including information regarding your employer, that information will be subject to the same conditions as set forth above.

#### Information Obtained from Children Under 13 Years of Age

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Privacy Policy, the following terms shall apply to User Information obtained from users under the age of 13 years (“Junior Users”).  For the purposes of this section, the term “Personal Information” means individually identifiable information about an individual collected online, including:

(A) a first and last name;  
(B) a home or other physical address including street name and name of a city or town;  
(C) an e-mail address;  
(D) a telephone number;  
(E) a Social Security number;  
(F) any other identifier that the Federal Trade Commission shall determine permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual; or  
(G) information concerning a Junior User or the parent or legal guardian of that Junior User that Company collects online from the Junior User and combines with an identifier described in (A) through (F) above.

Upon request of the parent or legal guardian of a Junior User, Company will, upon verification of the identity of the parent, provide the parent or legal guardian:

  * a description of the specific types of Personal Information collected from the Junior User
  * any Personal Information collected from the Junior User



The parent or legal guardian of a Junior User may request the information described above by contacting Company by mail at Market Realist Inc. 447 Broadway, 2nd Floor New York, NY 10013, or by e-mail at privacy@marketrealist.com.

Upon request of the parent or legal guardian of a Junior User, Company will cease to use, or to maintain in retrievable form, any Personal Information collected from that Junior User, and will not collect any further Personal Information from that Junior User.  Upon such a request, Company reserves the right to terminate the registration of the Junior User, and/or terminate and/or limit the Junior User’s access to the Site.

Company does not condition participation by Junior Users in any game, opportunity to win a prize, or other activity, upon the Junior User disclosing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.

Company has established and maintains procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the Personal Information collected from Junior Users, just as it protects the User Information provided by all of its users.  The methods used to protect this information are described below.

Company reserves the right to collect, to use, and to disclose Personal Information as and when necessary:

  * to protect the security or integrity of the Site;
  * to take precautions against liability;
  * to respond to judicial process; or
  * to the extent permitted under other provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety.



#### Right to Review, Correct and Delete User Information

If you provide us with User Information, you have the following rights with respect to that information:

  * To review the User Information that you have supplied to us
  * To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in User Information that you have supplied to us
  * To request that your User Information not be used to contact you
  * To request that your User Information be removed from any solicitation list that we use
  * To request that your User Information be deleted from our records
  * To opt out of being solicited by the Company or by third parties



If you request that your User Information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request while we verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party.  If you request that your User Information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the Site. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@marketrealist.com.

#### Security Measures

No method of safeguarding information is 100% secure.  We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect User Information from unauthorized and improper access, use, disclosure, modification, and destruction. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.

Within the Company, we restrict access to User Information to individuals who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our products or services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
