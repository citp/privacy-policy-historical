If you do give us that information, we use it only for the stated purpose. We **don't** use cookies to track visitors to our Web site; however, for some of the interactive applications we do use them to hold your session information. Once you finish the application the cookie is removed. 

Our web server software automatically logs the following information every time someone visits our Web site:
