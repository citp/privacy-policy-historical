This is the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) website Privacy Policy, which discloses the privacy practices of [maa.org](http://maa.org/). The following principles govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our website.

#### Protecting Your Information

At MAA, protecting the privacy of our members and customers is important. We encrypt the transmission of sensitive (such as credit card numbers) information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration by using industry-recognized security safeguards. We use both internal and external resources to review our security procedures. We follow industry-recognized standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once received. We cannot guarantee its absolute security as no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure but we are committed to safeguarding your sensitive information. If you have any questions about the security on our website, contact [maaservice@maa.org](mailto:maaservice@maa.org).

#### Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact [maaservice@maa.org.](mailto:maaservice@maa.org) We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### How We Use Your Information

When we ask you for information on our website, we will tell you how the information you provide will be used. You retain the right to opt-out of communications that are not transactional at anytime.

#### Our Relationships With Third Parties

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in servicing you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders, providing customer service or delivering subscription content. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. When you request any of these products or services, you permit us to provide your personal information to the contractor to fulfill your request. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We may disclose your information if we are required to by a law enforcement action such as a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or similar legal process. We may also disclose your information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

If MAA is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

#### How We Use Web Technology

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts or similar technologies are used by MAA and our partners (our marketing partners), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (providers of our online and mobile version of MAA magazines; job listing host site; etc). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies for [our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication]. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. This automatically collected data is assigned a generic session ID and is not linked to specific users.

Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button [and widgets, such as the “share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site]. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

#### Your Contact Information

We may use your contact information to tell you about other products we think might interest you. Specifically, with your consent we sell this information to third parties we feel may provide goods and services that may be of interest to our members. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at [maaservice@maa.org](mailto:maaservice@maa.org).

Our site includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of MAA. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.

If your personal information changes or if you no longer desire our services, you can update, delete, or correct your personal information relating to your membership, member directory, email, and newsletter preferences by logging into maa.org and selecting the appropriate tab on the My Profile page or by contacting Customer Service at 1-800-331-1622 or email [maaservice@maa.org](mailto:maaservice@maa.org).
