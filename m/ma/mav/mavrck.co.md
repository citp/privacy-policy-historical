The Mavrck Services are designed to offer users of the Mavrck Services (collectively, “ **Users** ,” “ **you** ,” or “ **your** ”) the opportunity to connect with each other and the third parties to which Mavrck provides marketing and promotional services (“ **Brands** ”), share information about and opinions on products and services offered by our Brands, and participate in certain sweepstakes, contests, challenges and other promotions (“ **Promotions** ”).

This Privacy Policy sets forth Mavrck’s policy with respect to information that, alone or in combination with other information, could be used to identify you (“ **Personal Data** ”) and other information that is collected from Users. This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data we collect through the Mavrck Services, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use, which are available at: [https://www.Mavrck.co/legal/terms-of-use ](https://www.mavrck.co/legal/terms-of-use).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Data that our Brands provide to us or otherwise make available to the Mavrck Services, that we process on our Brands’ behalf. Our practices concerning this data are addressed in our contract with the applicable Brand.
