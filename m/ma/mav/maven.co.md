On occasion, these newsletters may provide you with information regarding promotions or special products or services. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. See “Opting out of Certain Communications” below for more information.

**Opting Out of Certain Communications**

**Invite and Earn**

If you choose to use our Invite & Earn referral feature to invite a contact to join Maven, we will ask you for your contact’s name and/or email address.

We utilize an Import Contacts feature to help you invite contacts to join Maven. Our Site is capable of importing from many different email address book platforms. On the Invite and Earn page, you may select from which email address book you would like to import your contacts to our site. You will then be prompted through a step-by-step process that will allow you to import names and email addresses from your email address book. Once your contacts are successfully imported, you may select or deselect any or all of them to choose whom you wish to invite, and then click “Invite” to send them an invitation.

Each person that you invite will receive three email invitations to join Maven. The first invitation will be sent immediately when you click “Invite”. If the invitee does not respond, a reminder invitation will be sent three days later, and a final reminder invitation will be sent one week after the first reminder. Invitations may indicate that they were sent by you. All invitations contain unsubscribe links through which the invitee may decline the invitation.
