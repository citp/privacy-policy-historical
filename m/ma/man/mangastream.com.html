		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		We recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. We will never sell your personal information to third parties without your 
		solicitation.
		
		<br><br>

		We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including 
		your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about 
		goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this 
		information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.
		
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Log Files</h2>
		As with most other web servers on the internet, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include 
		which website you were referred from, your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Comcast), the 
		browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout 
		our site.
		
		<br><br>
		
		We also employ third party tracking services such as Google Analytics, which collects similar information to provide us with an offsite clean 
		interface to look at our statistics. You can read how Google protects your privacy on their own privacy policy.
		
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
		We use cookies to store information for your convenience to save color preferences. We also use third party advertisements on MangaStream.com 
		to support the costs of maintaining our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise 
		on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, 
		your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting 
		purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as 
		showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
		
		<br><br>
		
		You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in 
		programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can greatly affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as most other 
		websites. This could include the inability to login to our website for longer than a single browser session.
