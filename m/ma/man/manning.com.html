<h3>Why we collect personal information</h3>
<p>Manning collects personal information so that we can keep our readers informed.&nbsp; We use the data to let you know about recent news, upcoming release dates, special offers, events and the like that our customers might wish to hear about.&nbsp; We also collect anonymous information about how visitors make use of our website, in order to analyze and improve the user experience.</p>
<h3>The information Manning gathers and tracks</h3>
<p>Manning collects two types of information:&nbsp; 1) data that is submitted voluntarily by visitors wishing to receive news or product information, to provide us with feedback or to purchase products directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data that we gather while users are interacting with our Web sites.</p>
<p>Manning never sells or rents email addresses or other personally identifiable information that visitors provide.&nbsp; We will, however, release information in order comply with the law, or when it is appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Manning, our users or others.&nbsp; It may be necessary for Manning to exchange information with other companies or agencies in the interest of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<h3>Tracking information</h3>
<p>Manning tracks such information as clickstreams, click through, pageviews, and search terms in order to analyze cumulative website usage.&nbsp; This traffic and demographic data is completely anonymous, is not analyzed or stored in a manner which identifies individual users, and is for internal use only.&nbsp; We do not share this information with any third parties, ever.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Manning uses small data files called cookies to help us tailor our websites to individual users.&nbsp; Cookies are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser, and then enable our systems to recognize our user’s computers and to track user traffic patterns.</p>
<p>Your browser can be set to block cookies or to give you a warning before accepting them.&nbsp; You can still use our website even if you block cookies, but certain site features or functions may not be available to you.</p>
<p>No third parties are involved in Manning’s use of cookies.&nbsp; That means we don’t set third party cookies, share information, or provide tracking support to any third parties.</p>
<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>This policy was put in effect on September 21, 2005.</p>
<p>If we revise our Privacy Policy, we will post any changes on <a href="http://www.manning.com/">www.manning.com</a>.&nbsp; Should we wish to use personally identifiable information for a different purpose than was stated at the time it was collected, we will send users notice via email and give them the choice of opting-out of any new use of their personal information.</p>
