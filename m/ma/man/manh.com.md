# Privacy Policy | Manhattan Associates

**General**

Manhattan Associates respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to serve as our global Privacy Policy for all regions and countries around the world. The policy outlines the information Manhattan Associates will collect and how we will use that information. This policy will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit any Manhattan Associates websites, respond to our advertisements or otherwise provide information to us.

**Information Manhattan Associates Collects About You**

When you do provide us with information, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; we may use that information to contact you; we may use that information to allow you to access limited-entry areas of our website as may be appropriate; and we may provide that information to third parties.

Manhattan Associates may collect information when you:

  * Register on a Manhattan Associates website or Partner portal
  * Request information, a quote, or place an order for products and/or services
  * Request assistance or services from our Customer Support or Professional Services Organizations
  * Provide feedback in an online survey
  * Participate in marketing events
  * Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list
  * Visit a Manhattan Associates website or Partner portal



  For marketing purposes, we may share your information with our business partners, or we may send you information about those partners’ goods and services. We or our business partners may contact you by mail, telephone, fax, email or other electronic messaging service with offers of goods and services or information that may be of interest to you about supply chain sector services, materials, news or training. By providing us with your fax number, telephone numbers, email or mailing address you consent to being contacted by these methods for these purposes. If you do not wish to receive such information from us or our business partners, please contact us using the details provided below any time. No further action is necessary if you have previously indicated to us that you do not want to receive such marketing material.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Manhattan Associates will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you do not want your personally-identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us.  

We will only collect, store and use your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. We do not sell your personal information. We will only share your personal information outside of Manhattan Associates with your consent, as required by law or to protect Manhattan Associates, its clients or the public, or with companies that help us to fulfill our obligations to you and that share Manhattan Associates’ commitment to protecting your privacy and information. 

In some cases you may provide us with sensitive personal data, such as special dietary requirements for reasons of health or religion, for the purposes stated above. If you are our client your continuing relationship with us demonstrates your consent to this processing. When you give us information about another individual for business purposes, you do so on the basis that the other individual has agreed, and has consented to the processing of his or her personal information, including sensitive personal data, and (where information is submitted in Europe) to the transfer of his or her information outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and to your receiving on his or her behalf any privacy or data protection notices.

You are entitled to ask for a copy of your information (for which we may charge a small fee) and to correct any inaccuracies.

**When We Disclose Personal Information**

Because Manhattan Associates is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Manhattan Associates business units around the world. They will protect your personal information in accordance with this Manhattan Associates Privacy Policy.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically**

In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site or advertisement.

**Information We May Place Automatically On Your Computer's Hard Drive**

When you view one of our websites or advertisements, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

**Protection of Your Information**

We strive to protect the security of your information by use of appropriate measures and processes.

We may sometimes need to transfer personal information that is submitted to us in Europe to countries which do not provide the same level of data protection as the EEA. If we do have a need to make such a transfer then we will put a contract in place to ensure that your information is adequately protected and your privacy respected.

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

Manhattan Associates reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and therefore you should review it regularly. When we make any updates, we will also revise the 'Last Updated' date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.

**Whom to Contact**

If your personal details change, if you change your mind about any of your marketing preferences or if you have any queries about how we use your information, please let us know by calling us at +1 770.955.7070, or by emailing us at [dataprotection@manh.com](mailto:dataprotection@manh.com).
