## Privacy Policy:

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, JMK Media Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. JMK Media's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how JMK Media's visitors use its website. From time to time, JMK Media Inc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

JMK Media Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on ManEverything.com blogs/sites. JMK Media Inc. only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
