# Terms & Conditions: Privacy

## Your Manta Information

Manta is provided by Manta Media, Inc. and its affiliates (“we” or “us”). Your Manta information consists of personally identifiable information collected or received about you when you make purchases from us, when you register with us, or when you log in to Manta as a registered user and interact with Manta products and services. Your Manta information may include (a) registration-related information (such as name, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address); (b) transaction-related information (such as credit card or other preferred means of payment, or a history of products purchased through us); (c) information about your visits to Manta or our other web sites, pages and services; (d) your responses to our offerings and advertisements; (e) information about the features or offerings you use from us; (f) your billing and shipping information; (g) customer service information; and (h) other information specifically related to your use of a particular Manta feature or offering. Your Manta information may be supplemented with additional information from other companies. 

## How Manta Information Is Used

Your Manta information is used to operate and improve the features, offerings and content presented to you by us; to personalize the content and advertisements provided to you; to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services; to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; to conduct research about your use of our products; and to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest.

Your Manta.com information will not be shared with third parties unless it is necessary to fulfill a transaction you have requested, or in other circumstances in which you have given your consent to the sharing of your Manta.com information to affiliates, partners, agents or other parties whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. You can make or change your choices about receiving offerings from us or our partners by going to http://www.manta.com/profile/newsletters. We may use your Manta information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers.

In the event that our ownership was to change as a result of a merger or acquisition by another company, your Manta information may be transferred. We will provide you notice prior to any such transfer of your Manta information.

From time to time you may receive e-mail or hard copy mail from us notifying you of new features, products and services that we believe will be of interest to you and your company. Any e-mails that you receive will provide an option to remove your name from future mailings. 

## Cookies, Advertising Networks

We may place "cookies" on your Web browser. Cookies are small pieces of information or text files that a website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on your computer's hard drive. Cookies make Web‑surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use the saved information to facilitate and improve your use of Manta. Please note that you will not be able to access and use all of Manta's features if you delete or refuse to accept cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set certain personalized preferences, and/or you may have difficulty completing transactions on Manta. 

Also, we, and certain third party companies under agreement with us, may deploy cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or similar technologies to collect and assemble non-personal, demographic, behavioral and technical information about the use of Manta from our users in order to group such users that share a common interest into general interest categories (collectively, “Audience Segment Cookies”).  Such Audience Segment Cookies, which do not identify you personally, may be placed when you access Manta, share content from Manta, when advertisements are presented on Manta, and/or when you respond to advertisements or other offerings on Manta. We and these third party companies may use such non-personally identifiable information in combination with your visits to Manta and other sites in order to present advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you, to measure the effectiveness of Manta and advertisements, and to help predict the characteristics and preferences of our audiences and the audiences of our third party companies. We may share certain information about you as a user that is not personally identified to you (such as user industry and position) with certain advertising network providers in order to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. The use of cookies by ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies.
