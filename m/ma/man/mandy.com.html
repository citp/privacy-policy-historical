<br><br>
Cookies are small text files that websites set on your computer to give you a better browsing experience. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
<br><br>

We publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website.  These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests.  To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour across the web using cookies.
