* hoverIntent r5 // 2007.03.27 // jQuery 1.1.2+
* <http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html>

* hoverIntent is currently available for use in all personal or commercial
* projects under both MIT and GPL licenses. This means that you can choose
* the license that best suits your project, and use it accordingly.
