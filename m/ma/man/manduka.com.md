This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information.

## Personally-Identifiable Information

Manduka, LLC typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally-identifiable information to Manduka, LLC through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want Manduka, LLC to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that Manduka, LLC not use your information by sending an e-mail to idealer[at]gmail.com, however, Manduka, LLC reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your Manduka, LLC services. Absent any instructions from you, Manduka, LLC may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by the Manduka, LLC family, authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom Manduka, LLC has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. Manduka, LLC will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those Manduka, LLC sites where you may provide Manduka, LLC with credit card or other ordering information via the web, Manduka, LLC protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary web-based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, Manduka, LLC will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and non-proprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, Manduka, LLC assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.

## Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information

In general, Manduka, LLC gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does NOT reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the Manduka, LLC sites visited. Manduka, LLC gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including “cookies” (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about Manduka, LLC services). Manduka, LLC does not combine information collected in this way with any personally-identifiable information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.
