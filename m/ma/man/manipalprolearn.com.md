In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online or hosted Programs and Services, Manipal may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting a form. It is optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Manipal may ask that you provide certain personal information (as well as certain non-personal information that may be tied to personal information), such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), country, e-mail address, employer, job title and department, and telephone and facsimile numbers,. Depending upon the activity you intend to use on some Manipal Services and Programs that you have enrolled, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Similarly, if you wish to delete your information that is mandatory, you will no longer be able to engage in that particular activity.

When you use the Site and the Services, Manipal may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of the Site and the Services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit webpages, click patterns, Session ID (a unique identifier assigned to the browser in connection to the Site), and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. Manipal also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Programs and Services.

If you decide to send us an electronic mail message (e-mail), the message will usually contain return e-mail address.

We may use that information in responding to your request, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. Please send us only information to help us process your request for the specified service.

On some of our web pages, we offer interactive forms that let you voluntarily consent to submit personal information (such as your e-mail, postal correspondence address, name of your organization, telephone no.). This occurs when you are registering for online counselling, various assessment tests, discussion boards, quizzes, seminars, workshops or training sessions offered by Manipal, downloading admission forms from Manipal. In those cases, all submitted information is used only for the purposes for which it is intended and is not made available to any third party, other than specifically permitted under this Privacy Policy.

Another instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible, and the pages are hosted for Manipal Global Education by such third party vendors. For example, on the enroll page for viz., [http://www.manipalprolearn.com](http://www.manipalprolearn.com/) or [http://www.manipalprolearn.co](http://www.manipalprolearn.co/) page and they are therefore governed by this Privacy Policy.

Such third parties are bound by contract with Manipal not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. We will be sharing any of the personal information provided by you in response to any subpoenas, court orders, or legal process.

We may also ask you to provide information of others such as when reporting suspected piracy. In this instance, we will ask for the person's or company's name and contact information so that we may investigate. Personal information supplied in these instances will only be used for the purpose being submitted.

Manipal also hires other companies to place our banner ads on other websites. Such companies perform tracking and reporting activities on ads served and user reaction ("third-party advertisement servers"). They do not collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviours associated with those IP addresses on our behalf, and we do not give any personal information to them. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to their own privacy policies. Manipal may also allow other companies to display advertisements on certain pages of the Site or within the Programs and Services. If you click on these advertisements these companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer which may allow them to display further advertisements to you.
