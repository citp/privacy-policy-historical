The services provided through the website may include inviting users to register for newsletters, responding to product enquiries, products sales, collecting job applications or other services not listed here.

Some of the data requested through the website must be captured in order for the service to be provided, and are indicated with an asterisk. Other data is purely optional and may be provided by the User to allow a more complete and personalized service or, subject to prior consent in the cases governed by current legislation, to analyse personal interests and information or habits or consumption choices. 

In particular:

**Registration to the website / Participation in a blog:** identification data such as name, surname, email address, as well as other optional personal information relating to the User are collected. If you register through the social media profiles (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) information on these profiles can be retrieved.

The legal basis for the processing of data is:

  * fulfilment of contractual obligations, if and as requested, by the User; and

### 2.2 Navigation Data

In addition to the following regarding cookies, the computer systems and software procedures used to operate this website acquire, during their normal operation, some personal data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols. This is information that is not collected to be associated with identified interested parties, but which by their very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow users to be identified.

This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by the Users who connect to the website, the addresses in the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) notation, the requested resources, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (success, error, etc.) and other parameters related to the operating system and the user's IT environment.

This data is used to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the website and to check its correct functioning.

The data could be used to identify responsibility in the event of possible IT crimes to the detriment of the website. The website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). To this regard, see the Google cookie policy for Google Analytics.

The purposes for processing such data are therefore to:

  * allow the website to function and perform the services requested by the User;
  * monitor and improve the operation of the website;
  * derive and use statistical information on the use of the website;
  * ascertaining responsibility in the event that a possible cyber security criminal act has been committed.
