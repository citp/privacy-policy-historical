### Exit Coinhive (in-browser bitcoin mining)

](https://manytools.org/contact/ "We like to hear from you!")

Thank you for your feedback on our (brief) test with browser based bitcoin mining. This seemed like a nice way to support this website, but turned out to be far too much of a burden to our visitors. So we've decided to remove it. Our apologies for the inconvenience it has caused.

### Migrated to HTTPS

](https://manytools.org/)

Happy to inform that Manytools is now fully Chrome-62-ready, thanks Google! A secure connection had been due for a very long time. Today we finally got around to upgrading the site to run on HTTPS. – (Starting October 2017, Chrome (version 62) will show a “NOT SECURE” warning when users enter text in a form on an HTTP page, and for all HTTP pages in Incognito mode.)
