### 3\. Providing us with information about someone else

If you provide us with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data and that you have informed them of our identity and the purposes (as set out above) for which their personal data will be processed.

### 4\. Dealing with your personal information safely

We offer the use of a secure server when you provide us with personal information as part of the website user registration process. SSL (the secure server software) encrypts your information before it is sent to us. We also take appropriate measures to ensure that the information disclosed to us is kept secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.

### 5\. Shopping securely

To ensure that shopping online is secure, your credit/debit details will be encrypted to minimise the possibility of someone being able to read your details as they are sent to us over the Internet.

We take the security of your transaction very, very seriously. All online purchases take place in a safe environment using the latest security technology to protect all of our customers. We encrypt your credit card information to ensure your transactions with us are private and protected whilst online. We accept orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - this means you cannot inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection.

In technical terms this means:  
We use a state of the art payment platform; Customer credit card data is protected with the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when transferred over the Internet. SSL provides for a variety of encryption technologies including RSA, 3-DES and AES. Credit card details are encrypted with AES before being stored. The production network is partitioned into a proxy server tier, an application server tier, and a database server tier. Servers running at each tier are protected using ipchains/iptables firewalling, which is set to only permit the necessary network traffic and deny and log everything else. The front end of the entire infrastructure is protected with a virtual firewall rack from a company called Inkra (http://www.inkra.com/) which provides additional firewalling and DoS protection.

In particular, unless expressly stated, we are not agents for these sites nor are we authorised to make representations on their behalf.
