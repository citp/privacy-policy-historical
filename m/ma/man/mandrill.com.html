When we say "we," "us," and "MailChimp,” we’re referring to The Rocket Science Group, LLC d/b/a MailChimp, a State of Georgia limited liability company. When we say “you” or “Member,” we’re referring to the person or entity that’s registered with us to use the Services.</p><p>We provide online platforms that you may use to create, send, and manage emails (the “Services”). We offer the Services on our websites http://www.mailchimp.com, http://www.tinyletter.com, and http://www.mandrill.com (each a “Website” and together the “Websites”). In the course of providing the Services, we may collect Personal Information, which means information about a Member.

Changes</h2><p>If there are any changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post them on the Website and send them to the last email address you gave us.

You may object to any changes within 20 days after they’re posted on our Website or delivered to you, in which case none of the proposed changes will be effective with respect to information that we’ve already collected from you; but will apply only to information we collect in the future. We won't treat information of any open account differently from any other open account. If you object to changes in our Privacy Policy, we’ll have to terminate your account. That said, if we ever changed our Privacy Policy to expand our rights to use or disclose Personal Information for marketing purposes, you‘d be able to opt out without termination.</p></div><div class="size1of3"></div></section><section id="section-3"><div class="size2of3"><h2>3.

<li><p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong> When you register to use the Services, communicate with our customer service team, send us an email, or post on our blog, you’re giving us information that we collect. That information may include your IP address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, credit card information, and other details like gender, occupation, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, and stored by us, only as described in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and Privacy Policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>List and Email Information</strong>: When you add an email Distribution List or create an email with the Services, we have access to the data on your list and the information in your email.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information from your Use of the Service</strong>: We may get information about how and when you use the Services. This information may include your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions taken by you within the application.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="tip-anchor" data-target="#tooltip-strongcookies-strong" title="Cookie management tools from your browser won’t remove Flash cookies, but here’s how to <a href=&quot;http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html&quot;>manage privacy settings</a> for them."><strong>Cookies</strong></span>: When you register to use MailChimp, we store "cookies," which are strings of code, on your computer. We use those cookies to collect information about when you visit our Website, when you use the Services, your browser type and version, your operating system, and other similar information. You may turn off cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions on your browser, but if you block our cookies, it may be more difficult (and maybe even impossible) to use the Services. When you play one of the videos on the Websites, the Flash player may use local shared objects, which are also called Flash cookies. We don’t use these Flash cookies for anything, but we can’t stop the player from dropping them (we tried).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Web Beacons</strong>: When we send emails to registered MailChimp customers, we'll sometimes track who opened the emails and who clicked the links. We do that to measure our Email Campaigns’ performance and to improve our features for specific segments of customers. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create the reports you see about who has or hasn’t opened emails or clicked links. Reports are also available to us when we send you email, so we may collect and review that information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>: We may get more information about you, like name, age, and participation in social media websites, by searching the internet or querying third parties (we’ll refer to that information as <span class="tip-anchor" data-target="#tooltip-supplemental-member-information" title="We use this “Supplemental Member Information” to develop features like Social Pro, a tool that helps you learn about your subscribers and send them more relevant content.">Supplemental Member Information</span>).

<li><p><strong>Social Media Widgets.</strong> Our Websites include social media features, like the Facebook Like button. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Links to Third-Party Sites.</strong> Our Websites include links to other websites, whose privacy practices may be different from MailChimp’s.

We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Website you visit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> If it is necessary to provide you a service you've requested, like send you a T-shirt or enable a feature like Social Pro, then we may provide your personal information to a service provider.
