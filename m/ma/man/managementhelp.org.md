In addition to the personal information you supply, we may automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable technical information. The technologies we may use to gather this information may include use of “cookies”.

Cookies are very small pieces of information a user's browser stores on the user's computer. We collect this information to (1) evaluate how visitors, guests, and customers use the Website and/or the Services; (2) evaluate the performance of our Website and Services, and (3) also provide you with personalized information if you opt in for that kind of information.

#### Google Analytics Use of Cookies

The Website uses a tool called “Google Analytics” to improve the use of the Website. Google Analytics does not collect users' names or personally identifiable information (information that could be used to personally identify or contact you); it collects only the IP address from which the user accessed the Website. Google analyzes the activity from that address to record the user's time of the visit to the Website, time spent on its pages, the website where the user was referred from, and the user's type of browser and operating system. To collect that information, Google places a cookie on the user's computer. The cookies cannot be used by any organization other than Google. Description of how Google Analytics collects and processes this information is described at [How Google uses data when you use our partner's sites or apps](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this Website is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
