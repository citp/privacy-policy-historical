The Mandee Privacy Policy is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New Jersey in the United States, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under or out of the Policy shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts within the State of New Jersey. If any provision of the Policy is found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any term or condition of the Policy shall not be deemed a waiver thereof and shall not prevent its later enforcement.  This Policy is subject to change without prior notice, but we will post all changes on our website, www.mandee.com.
