## Email marketing

We are keen to communicate our activities, institutional views, latest news and points of excellence with staff, stakeholders, students, alumni and supporters. We do this by providing information through a range of online and offline channels including publications, events, press releases, social media and email.

In order to do this we have a database that contains personal data collected by the University during the course of our relationship with our stakeholders, staff, students, and alumni.  We aim to keep your data up to date and welcome any updates to your details or corrections to any inaccuracies you may wish to provide.

You have a right to request copies of the data held about you by the University. To do so, please contact [dataprotection@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:dataprotection@manchester.ac.uk). If you no longer want us to use your data, or wish to amend the type of communications you receive, then you can opt out at any time via the unsubscribe link included in every email.

We value our relationship with you and we use your personal data to personalise our communications, improve our services and ensure we work efficiently and effectively.

Unless you have requested otherwise, your data is accessible to the University and its Schools, Faculties, Institutes, Centres, divisions, directorates and recognised alumni associations connected to the University. It is used and processed for a full range of communications and programmes involving academic and administrative departments. These include the following communications and marketing activities (by mail, email and telephone):

  * Sending University publications;
  * Promoting our services;
  * Notifying you of upcoming events;
  * Promoting discounts and opportunities.



Tools may be used to help us improve the effectiveness of our communications with you, including tracking whether the emails we send are opened and which links are clicked within a message.

Lastly, we use data to undertake analysis projects to ensure only effective and relevant communications are sent to you. A list of suppliers can be provided on request.

We utilise tools and resources to help us understand our stakeholders, staff, students, and alumni and gather information from publicly available resources (e.g. the electoral register, press, the charity register) to assess the capacity of these groups to support the University.
