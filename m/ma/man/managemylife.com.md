Effective December 15, 2009:

ManageMyLife.com Privacy Policy

The ManageMyLife Website (formerly known as ManageMyHome.com, hereinafter referred to as "ManageMyLife.com" or "ManageMyLife" or "the Site") wants to ensure that you understand what information we gather about you, how we use it, and the safeguards we have in place in order to protect it. By subscribing to ManageMyLife.com, filling out the forms on the website, or by giving us information while submitting a question or other content to ManageMyLife.com, you consent to the collection, use and sharing of your personally identifiable information, as defined below, in accordance with the our Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use.

ManageMyLife may update this policy from time to time. Please check our policy periodically for changes. Your use of ManageMyLife.com, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Service and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law.

ManageMyLife.com is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18 years of age.

What Type of Information Do We Collect?

ManageMyLife.com collects personally identifiable information from you when you voluntarily submit the information to us in order to register as a member of ManageMyLifecom, when you submit questions, create ToDo lists, or otherwise post content to the site.

Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, telephone number and any other information you voluntarily provide to us which identifies you as an individual. You may choose to additionally provide us with information about your life and your home including the features, market value, product and service purchases and histories related to your home, car or other property. Such information is not considered to be "personal information" when it has been disassociated from you and cannot be easily connected to you. For example, when you submit a question to ManageMyLife.com, we may archive your question and answer for reference by ManageMyLife and by visitors to the Site and other web sites that are part of the Sears Holdings family of businesses. However, any information identifying you as an individual, your address, or your email address or other personally identifiable information ("PII") will have been removed.

ManageMyLife.com may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in ManageMyLife.com activities like subscribing to our email program, or participating in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, in connection with content or suggestions you post on the Site, when you submit your personal, family and home information, create "To Do" lists and when you submit questions to the ManageMyLife.com community. You may provide as much or as little information about your life as you like, although the more information you provide, the more useful our services will be.

ManageMyLife.com also collects personal information from the Sears Holdings family of businesses and third party service providers that may have about you or your home. The Sears Holdings family of businesses includes all Sears Holdings affiliates, as well as other selected businesses with which Sears Holdings and its affiliates have a relationship and which have agreed to adhere to our strict standards for providing quality products and services, responding to your needs, and protecting customer information.

ManageMyLife.com also collects information about you and your home, such as its value or mortgages, that may be available via public records.

ManageMyLife.com collects non-personally identifiable information ("non-PPI”, for example: your interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom you are affiliated) from you when you choose to provide or post non-PII information on ManageMyLife.

Non-PII may also be collected from you by means of Cookies and Pixel Tags. Cookies are small bits of information that this web site places on your computer. We and our 3rd party service providers use cookies and Pixel Tags to identify your IP address, browser type, domain name, and specific web pages through which you click. This data is collected automatically and utilized to help us look for trends to improve our web site and your interactive experience. The cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to the Web site and to provide you with a customized experience that we feel will be of value to you. The cookies that are configured by this web site do not contain any personally identifying information, such as your name, or sensitive information, such as your credit card number. Additional information regarding browser cookies and how to disable them is described below.

ManageMyLife.com may also collect additional information about you from third parties including demographic information (such as number of household members, age, and gender) and purchase preference information. We use this information to customize your experience on our web site and on other Sears Holdings family of business web sites and to provide you with the most relevant products, services and offers.

What Information Do We Share and with Whom?

We do not rent or sell your information to outside marketers. We may share your information (as described above) with members of the Sears Holdings family of businesses to provide you with products or services that you have requested or to provide you with promotional offers that we believe will be of interest to you. The Sears Holdings family of businesses includes all Sears Holdings affiliates, as well as other selected businesses with which Sears Holdings or its affiliates have a relationship and which have agreed to adhere to our strict standards for providing quality products and services, responding to your needs, and protecting customer information.

**To Do Lists** — ManageMyLife.com enables you to create and share To Do lists. This feature allows you to create a list of tasks and share it with the ManageMyLife.com community. The To Do List feature is intended to enable you to quickly create and share lists, tasks and details with other members of the ManageMyLife community. You may use this feature to contribute your own lists, tasks and details to ManageMyLife.com's to collective a body of knowledge. By contributing your lists, tasks and details to the community, you enable others to benefit from your knowledge. You may even discover a smarter way to get your own things done. Although the To Do list feature is by default Social in nature and your lists, tasks and details are automatically viewable and searchable by others, we provide you with the option of making individual details, tasks or your entire list of tasks and details private, which prevents others from seeing (and benefiting from) your contributions. Whether public or private, your To Do lists, tasks and details are considered User Generated Content and as such are governed by the [managemylife.com ](http://www.managemylife.com/)[Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/mmh/dhtml/TermsOfUse.html), which we encourage you to read.

We also may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it. There may be instances when we may access or disclose your information in order to protect or defend the legal rights or property of Sears Holdings and its affiliated companies or their employees and agents, to protect the safety and security of users and members, and to protect against fraud.

Sears Holdings may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, personal information may be one of the assets transferred.

In certain circumstances, we may share your information with service providers that need access to your information to provide operational or other support services. To ensure the confidentiality and security of your information, service providers must agree to safeguard your information in strict compliance with this policy.
