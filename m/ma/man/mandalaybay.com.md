## I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

### A. Personal Information

"Personal Information" is information through which you can be identified. We collect Personal Information that you provide voluntarily to us.  Some examples of Personal Information that we may collect include your name, date of birth, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, gender, gaming activity (in jurisdictions where gaming is permitted), and purchase and reservation information. If you visit MGM Resorts, Personal Information may include your image in a live video feed that can be viewed on the MGM Web Sites.  Some Personal Information is considered "Confidential Personal Information".  Confidential Personal Information is your name in combination with one or more of the following: credit or debit card number, financial account number, driver’s license number, U.S. state identification card number, Social Security number, passport number, and naturalization number.

In addition to Personal Information that you provide voluntarily to us, we may obtain Personal Information from third parties including, but not limited to, business partners, family members, friends, and entities that direct you to or are located at MGM Web Sites or MGM Resorts.  In situations where your Personal Information is collected by third parties under contract with us for fulfillment and other purposes, we require such third parties to exercise reasonable care to protect your Personal Information and restrict the use of your Personal Information to the purposes for which it was provided.

### B. Non-Personal Information

"Non-Personal Information" is information about you or your activities through which you cannot be personally identified.  When you use the Internet, your web browser or software may transmit certain information to the servers that host the web sites you visit.  Such information may include, for example, the unique number assigned to your server or Internet connection, your geographic location, and your interactions with the MGM Web Sites, including what pages you look at and what information you download.  When you visit the MGM Web Sites, our servers and servers operated by third-party advertising companies may collect Non-Personal Information.  In situations where it is possible to do so, Non-Personal Information may be linked to Personal Information.

### C. Cookies and Information Collected by Advertising Companies

When you visit MGM Web Sites, we use “cookies” and similar technologies to help us recognize and serve you better.  Cookies are small files that contain information sent by a web site that is saved on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies enable us to gather data such as web pages visited, links clicked, and material download.  Cookies also are used to put a unique identifier on your computer.  This helps us to generate statistics regarding usage of MGM Web Sites, such as the percentage of repeat visitors.  In situations where it is possible to do so, this unique identifier may be linked to Personal Information.

There are different types of cookies including “browser” cookies (also known as html cookies) and Flash cookies (also known as Local Shared Objects).  You can configure your browser to reject browser cookies or to notify you when browser cookies are offered so that you can accept or reject such cookies.  However, if you reject browser cookies, you may not be able to conduct some transactions or use some services on MGM Web Sites.  In addition, blocking or deleting browser cookies may not block or delete other types of cookies including Flash cookies.  For information on blocking or deleting Flash cookies, click [here](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/search/index.cfm?term=privacy&siteSection=downloads).

Third-party advertising companies that work with us may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect Non-Personal information at the MGM Web Sites and other web sites for a variety of purposes including providing you with advertisements that are likely to be of interest to you.  This type of ad customization is sometimes referred to as “online behavioral advertising.”  For more details about cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies that may be used by third-party advertising companies, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).  If you would like more information about your choices concerning behavioral advertising, including how you may opt-out of some uses of information collected by members of the Network Advertising Initiative that may collect Non-Personal Information at the MGM Web Sites, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

## II. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

## IV. SECURITY

Personal Information and Non-Personal Information collected by MGM Resorts International, the MGM Web Sites and MGM Resorts are stored on secure servers, which are protected by firewalls and other industry standard security measures. These security measures are intended to protect these servers from unauthorized access. However, no security system is impenetrable, and these systems could become accessible in the event of a security breach.  We have controls in place that are designed to detect potential data breaches, contain and minimize the loss of data, and conduct forensic investigations of a breach.

Our staff is required to take reasonable measures to ensure that unauthorized persons cannot view or access your Personal Information. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

We cannot enforce or control the security of the computers, electronic devices, or electronic communication method that you may use to send e-mails and submit information to us over the Internet. You are responsible for ensuring that the computers, electronic devices and electronic communication methods you use will provide adequate security for communicating with us. We are not responsible for the disclosure or interception of information that you send us before we receive it.

As a standard security practice, we will take reasonable steps which are standard in the industry to ensure that the communication methods used to support the MGM Web Sites do not permit connection or communication by methods that have known security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. As such, if you experience trouble using an MGM Web Site, it may be an indication that you need to upgrade your Internet browsing tool or application to a newer version that supports more secure communication methods.

## V. OTHER WEB SITES

We are not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of other web sites, including web sites operated by our business partners or other third parties.  You should review and understand the privacy policies posted on any linked sites you visit before using those sites or providing any Personal Information.

## VI. PERSONS UNDER AGES 18 AND 21

Certain of our areas and activities are intended for persons 21 or older.  If you are under 21, we ask that you do not access or attempt to access any areas or participate in any activities that are restricted to persons 21 or older.  We do not knowingly collect or allow the collection of Personal Information from persons under 18. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under 18 and believe that the person has provided us with Personal Information, you may contact us at [privacy@mgmresorts.com](mailto:privacy@mgmresorts.com) and request that it be deleted from our files.

## VII. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We reserve the right to revise this Policy at any time without notice. When this Policy is revised in a material way, notice will be posted on the MGM Web Sites along with the revised Policy.
