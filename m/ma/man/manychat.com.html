<p></p>
<p><span>At manychat.com we consider the privacy of our visitors, and the security of their personal information, to be extremely important. This Privacy Policy document describes, in detail, the types of personal information we collect and record at manychat.com, and how we use this information.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><u>LOG FILES</u></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Like many other Web sites, manychat.com makes use of log files. These files merely log visitors to the site - usually a standard procedure for hosting companies, and a part of hosting services's analytics. The information inside the log files includes: internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and in some cases, the number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user's movement around the site, and to gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information, are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
