# Manula: Privacy Policy

## Our Philosophy

We know that your privacy is very important to you, and because we want to build a long-term relationship with you, we've tried to make our policies as fair and clear as possible.

We'll be updating this in the future to make it better - if you notice something confusing, or something that bothers you about our policies, please feel free to contact us. We're always interested in improving.

## What information do you collect?

When you register for Manula we ask for information such as your name, company name, and email address. At the time that you register for account you will not be required to enter a credit card - but if you choose to subscribe to a paid plan, you have to provide a credit card. We don't collect your credit card information directly - see Who can see my credit card information? below.

## What do you use my information for?

Proton 27 uses your collected information to improve the Manula product and to respond to your customer service requests and support needs. We may occasionally contact you with product updates that we feel will improve your experience with Manula. These emails will always include a prominent, and effective, unsubscribe link.

## How do you protect my information?

Proton 27 uses secure third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary technology to run our services. The most important of these is Rackspace Cloud. For more information on the steps that Rackspace takes to protect information stored in its services see their [Security and Compliance Center](http://www.rackspace.com/security/). 

While we retain all rights to our code, databases, and applications, you retain all rights to your data. Proton 27 does not store your credit card information directly - see Who can see my credit card information? below.

## Who can see my credit card information?

No one at Proton 27. We use the secure Braintree payment service. Braintree encrypts your credit card information in their database and is [PCI compliant](http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10448197-245.html), so you can feel good about how they secure your information. You can read more about their security measures on their [Security Infrastructure page](https://www.braintreepayments.com/developers/security).

## Do you disclose any information to outside parties?

Proton 27 does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information, with the exception of when we believe the release is necessary to comply with the law. If we do think this is necessary we'll try to keep you informed as much as possible.

## Do you use cookies?

Yes, cookies (small files sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer) are required to use Manula. Cookies enable us to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.  


## What if I have a question?

We'd love to answer any questions you may have about our privacy policy. You may contact us through our [Contact Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20130608230032id_/http%3A//www.manula.com/contact).
