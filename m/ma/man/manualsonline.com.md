# Privacy Policy | ManualsOnline.com

ManualsOnline.com ("ManualsOnline") is committed to protecting our users' privacy. This privacy policy is designed to inform users of ManualsOnline (the "Site", defined more fully below) about how ManualsOnline gathers and uses non-personally identifying and member information, and in what circumstances ManualsOnline will disclose such information. 

### Enforcement

If you believe that ManualsOnline has not complied with this Privacy Policy, or if you have any other complaint with regard to collection, use or disclosure of personal information by ManualsOnline, you may send a written notice of complaint to: 

**ManualsOnline.com**

**c/o OwnerIQ, Inc.  
**27-43 Wormwood Street 4th Fl  
Boston, MA 02210  
Attention: Privacy Coordinator  
E-mail: [privacy@owneriq.com ](mailto:privacy@owneriq.com)

OwnerIQ will investigate your complaint and respond to you promptly.

### Key Definitions

In this Privacy Policy, we use the following key definitions. Other terms are defined in the body of the policy.

" **Click stream Data** " means the information that ManualsOnline of its affiliates collects through cookies, log files, beacons and clear GIFs, as described below.

" **Content Provider** " means a third party that owns a user manual or other document to which OwnerIQ links to or displays on the Sites.

" **Sites** " include subdomains of www.manualsonline.com. 

" **User** " or " **User** " means any person viewing any page of the Sites.

" **Third Party Content** " means the user manuals and other documents available through the Sites and owned by Content Providers. This Privacy Policy Does Not Apply to Third Party Websites.

The Sites host thousands of user manuals and other product support documentation. Some Third Party Content made available through the Sites is maintained on the website of the Content Provider, and not on ManualsOnline. This means that when you click through to that Third Party Content, you will be leaving ManualsOnline. It will be clear to you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page will change, and the URL will no longer refer to ManualsOnline. This Privacy Policy does not govern other links or the use and disclosure of any information you choose to disclose to the Content Provider on the Content Provider site.

### What Information Do We Collect?

**Member Information** : By registering as a Member ("Member"), ManualsOnline collects your email address, zip code and information about products that you may own or are interested in. Our primary goal in collecting member information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services, and to offer you opportunities to obtain other products and services from our partners.

You may also provide additional information, including but not limited to items such as your name, country, and telephone number ("Member Details"). At the time you register to become a Member, or later when you access a particular page or document, subscribe to an e-mail newsletter, or respond to a survey, ManualsOnline may collect additional information, including but not limited to: your name, address, phone number, and information about things you own, plans you may have to purchase additional items, etc. All of this information together, including your email address and security question, is included in the definition of "Member Details".

Several of the services that we offer on our Sites may require registration as a condition of use. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to us. We may also obtain information about you from other third-party sources, such as US Post Office zip code information, and add it to the information you provided to us.  
**  
**Cookies**** : When you view the Site, a small file called a cookie is placed on your hard drive. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some of our web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.) If you become a Member, ManualsOnline will use cookies to authenticate your identity when you visit the Site and to personalize your user experience, such as by displaying your username, when you log on. ManualsOnline uses persistent cookies to link Members to their registration information, which allows our system to confirm a user's identity and access level on the Site. ManualsOnline also uses that information to track service selections, and save passwords so that Members do not have to log in each time they visit the Site. Additionally, ManualsOnline uses cookies to obtain non-personally identifying information such as the number of visits to the Site that a certain user has made, the movement of the user through the Site, and the searches that the user conducts on the Site. Such cookies are not tied to personal information on the site. This Site also contains cookies from other interest-based advertising companies.  
**  
**Clear GIFs & Servers****: We use electronic images known as "clear GIFs" - sometimes called "transparent GIFs", "Web bugs", "pixel tags" or "beacons" - that allow us and our partners, including third party ad networks and exchanges to track general user traffic patterns. ManualsOnline also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested. This information is included in Click Stream Data.  Unless you have registered as a Member, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you.  
**  
**Supplementary Information**** : ManualsOnline may supplement Member Details with publicly available information about a Member's demographics. For example, if a Member indicates she lives in X zip code, we may obtain information giving representative geographic information about X zip code. This information is called "Supplementary Information".

### How Do We Use the Information We Collect?

Member Information: ManualOnline collects member information supplied by visitors who register, as described above. That information lets us better tailor our content to visitor interests and helps our advertisers better understand the audience they are reaching. We use Member Details to deliver email newsletters on topics of interest, such as newsletters with useful information on the things you own, to better target advertiser promotions found in these newsletters and advertising you see when using the Sites, to solicit information and feedback in the form of surveys, and we also may send general promotional and marketing materials to our Members, either by email or regular mail. We use Member Details and Supplementary Information in aggregated form to understand our Member base and to market our services to our customers. User access to the Sites is free and is supported by paid content and sponsorships from our advertisers.

We may provide summary reports to our Content Providers, based on our analysis of Click stream Data. The type of information included in a summary report is "3,000 people looked at your information this week, and of those people 60% clicked through to download a user manual." This aggregated information is non-personally identifying and does not disclose to the Content Providers any Member Details about the individual users who saw or clicked on user manuals.
