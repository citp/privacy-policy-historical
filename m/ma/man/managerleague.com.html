	<p>At Fifth Season we recognize that privacy is important. This Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Fifth Season AS  (collectively,Fifth Season's "services"). In addition, where more detailed  information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post  separate privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us through <a href="mailto:webmaster@managerleague.com">email</a> or through our website.</p>
	<p><a name="information" id="information"></a><strong>Information we collect and how we use it:</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Information you provide</strong> - When you sign up for a ManagerLeague account or other Fifth Season service or promotion that requires registration, we ask  you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an  account password). We  may combine the information you submit under your account with  information from other Fifth Season services or third parties in order to  provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our  services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt  out of combining such information.<br>
		We never share or give out your registered information that is regarded as private. Private information like name and addresses are only used for purposes of identification or when sending out prizes won in competitions and similar activities. Your email address is used for identification, sending your password or to send you other important site-specific information. We also send out a newsletter now and then, but no more than 12 times per year. You can easily opt out of this newsletter in your preferences. Finally, we may use your regional information to provide you with regional content or advertising, like results from regional matches or regional news.<br>
		<br>
		  <br>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>ManagerLeague cookies</strong> - When you visit ManagerLeague, we send one or  more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your  computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to  improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences. Cookies are required to use our services, but they hold no personal information. <br>
	  <br>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Log information</strong> - When you use Fifth Season services, our  servers automatically record information that your browser sends  whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol  address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your  request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your  browser. <br>
	  <br>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>User communications</strong> - When you send email or other  communication to Fifth Season, we may retain those communications in order to  process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our  services. </li>
	  </ul>
	<p>Fifth Season  only processes personal information for the  purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy  notice for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes  include:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising; </li>
	  <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; </li>
	  <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and </li>
	  <li>Developing new services. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can find more information about how we process  personal information by referring to the privacy notices for particular  services. </p>
	<p>Fifth Season  processes personal information on our servers in Norway. We  may process personal information to provide our own services. In some  cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according  to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.</p>
	<p><a name="infochoices" id="infochoices"></a><strong>Choices for personal information</strong> </p>
	<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires  registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use  this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it  was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. </p>
	<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes  other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific  service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the  use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not  collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the  specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. </p>
	<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of  our services, in which case Fifth Season may not be able to provide those  services to you. </p>
	<p><a name="infosharing" id="infosharing"></a><strong>Information sharing</strong> </p>
	<p>Fifth Season  only shares personal information with other  companies or individuals outside of Fifth Season in the following limited  circumstances: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. </li>
	  <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated  companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of  processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these  parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and  in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate  confidentiality and security measures. </li>
	  <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or  disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy  any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable  governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service,  including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect,  prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or  (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of  Fifth Season, its users, its services, or the public as required or permitted by law. </li>
	  <li>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information,  such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for  example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such  information does not identify you individually. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><a name="infosecurity" id="infosecurity"></a><strong>Information security</strong> </p>
	<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against  unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or  destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data  collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as  well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access  to systems where we store personal data. </p>
	<p>We restrict access to personal information to Fifth Season employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in  order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals  are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to  discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they  fail to meet these obligations. </p>
	<p><a name="dataintegrity" id="dataintegrity"></a><strong>Data integrity</strong> </p>
	<p>Fifth Season  processes personal information only for the  purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy  or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data  collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only  collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide  or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the  personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but  we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information  whenever necessary. </p>
	<p><a name="access" id="access"></a><strong>Accessing and updating personal information</strong> </p>
	<p>When you use Fifth Season services, we make good faith efforts  to provide you with access to your personal information and either to  correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your  request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for  legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify  themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or  removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process  requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require  disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or  would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning  information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not  otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and  correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so  would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have  different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal  information. We provide the details for these procedures in the  specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. </p>
	<p><a name="enforcement" id="enforcement"></a><strong>Enforcement</strong> </p>
	<p>Fifth Season  regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory  authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve  any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be  resolved between Fifth Season and an individual. </p>
	<p><a name="policychanges" id="policychanges"></a><strong>Changes to this policy</strong> </p>
	<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time  to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your  explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.  Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the  changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice  (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy  changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of  the page by its effective date.</p>
