What We Gather And How We Use It  
For visitors to the Manticore Technology website who are not existing customers, we collect non-personally identifying information such as IP address, time of visit, click-sequence, and technical information about your browser. Non-personally identifying Information that we collect about the browsing habits of our visitors is used to optimize the design of our website by understanding what content our customers are interested in. We can then streamline the website to make it more user friendly for our visitors.

For current Manticore Technology customers, we collect personally identifying information as part of the Terms of Service for using any Manticore product. This information includes such things as name, physical address, phone number, email address and other information for billing purposes. Current customers can update this information by logging into their Manticore account and using the appropriate section of the account management area. This information is used primarily for billing and contact purposes as it relates to the use of our products. Manticore Technology may also send current customers email newsletters and announcements about new product releases or events. Additionally, we have the ability to monitor the sessions of current Manticore customers by username so that we can gauge usage levels and reenact customer click streams for trouble shooting purposes.

For non-Manticore customers and Manticore customers alike, we regularly track the results of email campaigns we send by monitoring email metrics such as open, click-thru, and no response rates. We also collect email addresses and contact information via our website. If you have volunteered your email address to us or we have acquired it via a third party, we may be able to identify your session on our website by your email address. We use the results of our email monitoring to qualify prospective customers by identifying who is interested in what. Visitors who read our email more frequently or visit our site often and view information about our products are much more likely to be contacted than those who do not.
