# Privacy Policy — Sales Engine Media

For the Sales Engine corporate site and for our online software services, we leverage our own SaaS product, the Manticore marketing automation platform, to analyze traffic on our website.

##  **WHAT INFORMATION WE GATHER AND HOW WE USE IT**

For visitors to the Sales Engine website who are not clients of Sales Engine, we collect non-personally identifying information such as IP address, time of visit, click-path, and technical information about your browser. Non-personally identifying information that we collect about the browsing habits of our visitors is used to optimize the design of our website by understanding what content our clients are interested in.

For current Sales Engine clients, we collect personally identifying information as part of the Terms of Service for using any Sales Engine product. This information includes such things as name, physical address, phone number, email address and other information for billing purposes. Current clients can correct or update this information by logging into their Manticore account and using the appropriate section of the account management area. This information is used primarily for billing and contact purposes as it relates to the use of our products.

Sales Engine will never sell any information that we have collected, personally identifying or otherwise, to a third party. This information is deemed proprietary information of Sales Engine and will be used only by our staff.

##  **COMMUNICATIONS FROM SALES ENGINE**

Sales Engine may send current clients email newsletters and announcements about new product releases or events. Additionally, we have the ability to monitor the sessions of current Manticore users so that we can gauge usage levels and reenact client click streams for troubleshooting purposes. Sales Engine respects the privacy of visitors to its website and provides an option to all visitors to opt-out or unsubscribe from all communications from Sales Engine (see below).

For non-Sales Engine clients and Sales Engine clients alike, we regularly track the results of our email campaigns by monitoring email metrics such as open, click-thru, and no-response rates. We also collect email addresses and contact information via our website. If you have volunteered your email address to us or we have acquired it via a third party, we may be able to identify your session on our website by your email address. We use the results of our email monitoring to qualify prospective clients by identifying who is interested in what. Visitors who read our email more frequently or visit our site often are more likely to be contacted than those who do not.

##  **TRANSFER OF DATA**

It is always possible that Sales Engine could participate in an acquisition or merger, either as an acquirer or an acquired entity. If another entity acquires Sales Engine through a purchase or corporate transaction, all information previously collected by Sales Engine, including non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable information, would be transferred to the acquiring entity. In such event, Sales Engine will safeguard the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information transferred to the acquiring entity. Sales Engine will either (i) ensure that the privacy policies of the acquiring entity are at least as protective of the personally identifiable information as Sales Engine's privacy policy, or (ii) provide you notice before any personally identifiable information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

##  **ACCESS TO YOUR DATA**

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you wish that your personally identifiable information no longer be used by Sales Engine, you may correct, update or delete your personally identifiable information by sending an email to privacy@salesengineintl.com. We will use good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personally identifiable information, correct the data if it is incorrect or incomplete, or delete the data at your request (if it is not required by law to be retained). We may decline to respond to requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require excessive technical effort or resources, or jeopardize the privacy rights of third parties.

##  **OPT-OUT/UNSUBSCRIBE**

If you have received email communications from us and would like to opt-out of future mailings, click the unsubscribe link in the email. Your email address will be permanently removed from our email lists.

You also have the ability, when asked for personally identifiable information, to elect not to have your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. For example, if you purchase services from Sales Engine but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from Sales Engine, you may indicate your preference at that time.

##  **DATA OWNERSHIP (CLIENTS ONLY)**

Our clients own the information collected using Sales Engine's services. We store this information for them for the duration of our contractual agreement. Unless required by law, we will not divulge any statistics or other data collected by our products to any party other than our client. When a contract with one of our clients is terminated, we will keep data for a discretionary period of time after the termination of the contract, and then we will permanently delete or destroy such information. Our clients may retain that information for any length of time, in accordance with their respective privacy policies.

The Sales Engine privacy policy is complimentary to the privacy policy adopted by our clients and appearing on our clients' respective websites. Although Sales Engine expects that its clients will comply with all laws and applicable regulations when using the Sales Engine services, Sales Engine does not make any warranty or guarantee as to how its clients may handle information obtained from or stored through our service. If we discover that a client of ours has engaged in unethical or illegal activities, Sales Engine may suspend that client's services (after a warning) and may report such client to the proper authorities. If you have a concern about the policy of a particular client of Sales Engine, please refer to that entity's website for their individual privacy policy, or contact them directly.

##  **INFORMATION WE GATHER FOR CLIENTS**

When used by our clients, our software services collect non-personally identifying information such as IP address, domain name, pages that were viewed, the referral source, and technical information such as browser type and operating system.

Depending on the level of service that a client selects, our software may also collect and use certain personally identifying information. Although we store this information for our clients, it is owned by our clients. Furthermore, our software is not technically capable of gathering personal identifiable information from any consumer on our clients' behalf without consumer consent. Accordingly, any personally identifiable information that is stored in our system must have been collected with the consent of the consumer.

The personally identifiable information that our software uses includes email address, a physical address, a telephone number, and other information that a consumer has provided to our client (by signing up for services, by subscribing to emails, etc.). Personally identifiable information is not shared among our clients and is owned in whole by the client with the relationship with the consumer. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of our clients to learn how they may use this data.

Sales Engine does not collect individual profile information across multiple client websites for aggregation. Our clients have access only to the data collected from their websites, and we do not build an aggregate profile of a visitor's browsing habits.

##  **DATA SECURITY**

The integrity and security of the data that we collect and store is our number one priority. Sales Engine follows accepted industry best practices to ensure that the data remains secure, including SSL encryption for data collection, proactive server security audits, proprietary encryption algorithms for database storage, redundant systems, and data backup.

Clients who use our service transmit raw data about their websites to our servers. Data that contains potentially sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, is sent using various encryption technologies. Sales Engine processes and analyzes the data and then provides the results of that analysis to our clients, online, via secure reports.

##  **USE OF COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS**

When you visit Sales Engine's website or the website of a client of Sales Engine, a cookie, or a small file of characters, is sent to your computer or other device that identifies your browser. All web browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie. If a consumer refuses the Sales Engine cookie, Sales Engine cannot collect any information on that consumer and such features as "Remember Me" will not work (requiring a consumer to re-enter information at each visit).

Sales Engine also employs web beacons, which are anonymous objects embedded in a website or email that enables the owner to track who has read the site/email or what portion of the site was read. Sales Engine uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies in order to improve the quality of our clients’ digital marketing efforts.

##  **QUESTIONS, COMPLAINTS AND ENFORCEMENT**

If you have a question or complaint regarding Sales Engine's privacy policy or Sales Engine's use of personal information, you may contact Sales Engine through this website or by writing us at the following address:

If the complaint or issue cannot be resolved directly by Sales Engine, Sales Engine will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including any local data protection authorities, to resolve an issue regarding the use of personal information.
