## Privacy and the MangomindSM Service

### HOW DO WE PROTECT THE SECURITY AND QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION AND FILES STORED ON THE MANGOMIND SERVICE?

Mangomind has been designed to offer the best-in-class security architecture by strong encryption applied exclusively at the client in combination with world-class challenge/response authentication. 

**Data you place on the Mangomind service is encrypted before it leaves your computer. This data remains encrypted on the servers and is not accessible in any decrypted form to Mangosoft or anyone with access to the Mangomind servers. Then, only after it is downloaded by you or those you specifically invite to access your Mangomind drives is it ever decrypted.**

**We believe that Mangomind is so secure that information and files you place on the Mangomind service just as secure, if not more secure, than the data stored on servers in your private LANs.**

Mangomind's connection authentication and data encryption components are described briefly here. For a more thorough description, please see the [Mangomind Security White Paper](https://web.archive.org/products/mangomind/securitywhitepaper.asp). 

  * **Connection Authentication**. When a Mangomind client computer connects to the Mangomind server, Connection Authentication validates that both are who they say they are. This means that someone else cannot pretend to be a Mangomind server, tricking your Mangomind software into sending it your data. And vice-versa -- no Mangomind client that you haven't invited to the drive can trick a Mangomind server into sending it your data. This authentication is performed through a challenge/response protocol using the RSA Public/Private key pairs of both parties. Every new connection made must successfully complete the challenge protocol.
  * **Data Encryption**. Mangomind encrypts your data using RSA 128 bit RC5 data encryption keys. Your data is encrypted with these keys on your Mangomind client just before it is sent on the wire to the Mangomind server. Once on the server, it remains encrypted. At no point after leaving your computer can anyone view the clear text version of your files. Most importantly, we employ a unique encryption key management system so that the usable keys are only available on the client machines. Only the client computer can download and then decrypt the data. Since the usable keys are not available anywhere on the server, no one can view your data by looking at the data contained there. Even the names of your files are changed on the server to meaningless strings so as not to hint at their contents.

### WHAT ARE COOKIES? HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?

Cookies enable us to customize and personalize your experience on our Web Site, including the products and promotions that are offered to you. Essentially, a cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and is stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies for several purposes in connection with the operation of our Web Site. 

  * Most important, we use cookies to identify you and access your information stored on our computers in order to deliver you a better and more personalized experience. For example, we use cookies to tell you about products and services specific to your interests.
  * We use cookies to save your password so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our Web Site.
  * We use cookies to estimate our customer base and customer usage patterns. Each browser accessing our Web Site is given a unique cookie that is then used to determine the extent of repeat visits and the customer activity during those visits. We use the historical information to help target promotions based on customer interests and behavior, both specifically to individual customers and on an aggregate basis with respect to all customers.
  * We also may use cookies to track your progress and number of entries in some promotions, sweepstakes and contests. For example, when a promotion uses cookies, the information coded to the cookie indicates your progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions and status of prize drawings.

Business partners that offer co-branded services and jointly-sponsored sweepstakes, contests and promotions on our Web Site, may use their own cookies. We have no control over those cookies, nor does this Privacy Policy cover how your personal information contained in those cookies may be used or protected. If you have any questions about the cookies of such third parties, or about the use of your personal information by such third parties, you should contact the site administrator or web-master of the third party site.

### HOW CAN YOU UPDATE, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?

You may edit your personally identifiable information and your password at any time by sending an e-mail to [webmaster@mangosoft.com](mailto:webmaster@mangosoft.com) and describing the changes to be made. 

### HOW DO WE PROTECT THE SECURITY AND QUALITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION POSTED TO OUR WEB SITES?

We have also taken steps to help protect the integrity of your personal financial information when you complete a purchase transaction on our Web Site. Specifically, we use VeriSign and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to facilitate confidential online business transactions. VeriSign and SSL help prevent your credit card number, name, address and telephone number from being read by unauthorized persons as this information is transmitted over the Internet. Also, we transfer your personal information to our secure server as soon as we receive your order. 

### WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY?

It is important to remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on-line, your information can be collected and used by others. If you transmit or post personal information on-line that is accessible to others, you will not be able to control how that information is used by others. When we receive the transmitted information, we will use the procedures summarized in this Privacy Policy to ensure the integrity and security of that information in our systems. Unfortunately, notwithstanding any of the steps taken by us, it is not possible to guarantee the security and integrity of data transmitted over the Internet. Consequently, while we take the above-described reasonable steps to protect your personal information, we cannot and do not warrant the security or integrity of any information you transmit to us when registering for our Web Site or otherwise. All such transmission of information is at your own risk. Moreover, though we are committed to having our Web Site comply with this Privacy Policy, you are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and your personally identifiable information. If you are careless with your password, or you decide to share your password with third parties, you must be aware of the risk that such third parties will have access to all your personally identifiable information.
