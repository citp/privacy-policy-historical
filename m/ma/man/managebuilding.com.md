# Privacy Policy | Buildium

Last updated November 22, 2010

We know privacy is important to you. It’s important to us, too. That’s why we will never give your personal information to anyone except as required by law. Period. End of story. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information we collect from you. We’ve tried hard to avoid any legalese, preferring plain English instead. If you have any questions about our policy, [please let us know](http://www.buildium.com/contact-us/).
