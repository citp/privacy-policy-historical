# Mango Languages - Privacy Policy

Creative Empire, LLC d/b/a Mango Languages (“Mango”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy tells you about our online collection and use of data. We feel it is important that you fully understand the terms and conditions under which we use the information we gather from you through the use of our Web site located at, or linked to, the URL [_www.mangolanguages.com_](http://www.mangolanguages.com/) (the "Site"). Please read this privacy policy ("Policy") carefully to understand how we will use and protect your personal information. We will not share your personal information with anyone except as described in this policy.

By using this site, you understand and agree to the terms of this policy. The Site is owned by Mango and may be accessed in the United States and abroad. For data protection purposes, Mango is the controller and, unless otherwise noted, is also the processor of data. Information collected may be stored, processed, accessed, and used in jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction.   


**1\. What information does Mango collect from or about you?**   


When you visit the Site, certain kinds of information, such as your IP address, browser type and language, and access times, may be collected automatically as part of the Site’s operation. We also may collect navigational information, including information about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the site.   


We may combine your visit and navigational information with personal information that you provide. You may always choose not to provide personal information, but if you so choose, certain products and services may not be available to you. Personal information (e.g., your first name, nickname, email, password and Country location) is collected when you register. Additional personal information (e.g., your credit card number and billing address) is collected to process transactions or to provide you with products and services.   


**2\. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?**   


Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide our visitors with a superior customized online experience. Among other things, we use customer contact information to fill orders, contact prior purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional emails, to operate and improve our Site, to provide customer service, to perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies, and to display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.   


We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send transaction-related communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, and purchase confirmations. We may also send you surveys or marketing communications to inform you of new products or services or other information that may be of interest. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications, you may follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included within each email communication. Please keep in mind that, if you choose not to receive marketing communications, you will continue to receive transactional or account communications (e.g., confirmation emails and account balance statements).   


In addition, we may perform statistical analyses of aggregate customer behavior. This allows us to measure relative customer interest in the various areas of each of our Site for product development purposes and to improve the design of our Site. Any information we collect is used for our own internal purposes to improve the content and navigation of our Site, to enhance users' experiences when visiting our Site, to customize the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by an individual user. We may also use information to notify consumers about updates to our Site, to complete user initiated transactions, to trace false orders and to contact consumers directly, or through our third-party service partners, for marketing purposes.   


Personal information collected by Mango may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Mango or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using our sites or services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Mango abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. If you would like to exercise any of your data protection rights (including the right to have your personal information deleted), please contact us using the “Contact Information” below. 

  
**3\. With whom do we share your information?**   


Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we do not sell, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site to others.   


We may share your personal information to third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in direct marketing, to conduct audits, etc. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.   


Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. We will notify you of such an occurrence as described in the “Policy Changes” section below.   


We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so by law to the appropriate governmental authorities, or in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public. We will disclose your personal information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. 

**4\. How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?**

If you would like to review or revise information that you previously provided to us, you may access your information in the “My Account” section of the Site. A customer service representative can also assist you in making any changes, as well as in exercising your right to have your personal information corrected or deleted. If you need additional assistance, please contact us at [_sales@mangolanguage.com_](mailto:sales@mangolanguage.com). You can expect a response from us within ten (10) calendar days. Please be advised that you cannot change your username without re-registering. Please note, that because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Note that we may retain changed or deleted information for archival or other purposes.   


**5\. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?**

The security of your personal information is of utmost important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information. We employ reasonable security measures to protect the security of the information you submit to us. For instance, when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. Our secure servers protect this information using password protection and advanced encryption, and we may use firewall technology for additional protection. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.   


If a password is used to protect your account and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. 

  
**6\. Forums & Other Interactive Services.**   


Our Site may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the sites (“Interactive Areas”). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas are open to the public and any personal information you post or provide at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for personal information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible for how others might use that information, including sending you unsolicited messages. Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at [_sales@mangolanguages.com_](mailto:sales@mangolanguages.com). Keep in mind that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems.   


**7\. Cookies/clear GIFs.**   


**Cookies:** Like many other commercial Site, our Site utilize standard technologies called "cookies" and clear GIFs to collect information about how each of our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. Cookies can securely store a customer's password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." For instance, cookies allow us to prepopulate (or fill in) an email field with your email address if you revisit one of our Site and place an order. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or capture your email address.   


We send a cookie to your hard drive when you make an order to record the product name, category of product that you ordered, the amount paid, the order number and any referral codes. No Personally Identifiable Information is recorded. When you click through to any one of our Site from a promotional email, our third-party advertising service partner may send a cookie to your hard drive recording your IP address and other related information. 

**Clear GIFs:** At times, we work with third-party service partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs help us better manage content on our Site by informing us of what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information. 

These third-party service partners use clear GIFs: (i) in HTML based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients; (ii) to record when products have been ordered from our Site; and (iii) to track the visitor traffic on our Site. These clear GIFs allow us to measure the usage of each of our Site by our visitors and the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. We may also use clear GIFs in a similar manner in our own emails and on our Site.   


Clear GIFs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information can be shared with the advertising company. We do, at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising service partners, but that information can only be used by our partner for our benefit.   


**8\. Children, parental consent and privacy.**   


The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000, and imposes certain requirements on Site directed toward children under 13 that collect information on those children, or on Site that know they are collecting Personal Information from children under the age of 13. We want to let you know that it currently is our policy not to collect Personal Information from any person under 13 because children are not permitted to use the Site or services on the Site, and we request that children under the age of 13 not submit any personal information to us via the Site. As one measure to ensure that we do not gather Personal Information from children, we require that all individuals provide a valid credit card number before completing a purchase order. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from children under 13, we shall attempt to notify such child's parent or guardian and erase such information from our records, unless the child's parent or guardian consents to our maintaining such information.   


**9\. You should carefully review privacy policies of any third-party Site accessible from any of our Site and any co-branded Site not covered by this Policy.**   


We may link to websites, including those of our subsidiaries and third-party content providers that have different privacy policies and practices from those disclosed here. We assume no responsibility for the policies or practices of such linked sites, and encourage you to become acquainted with them prior to use. These other sites may send their own cookies or clear GIFs to users, collect data or solicit Personally Identifiable Information. Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies or clear GIFs. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.   


**10\. Policy changes.**   


This Policy was last changed on August 20, 2008. We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy at any time. If we make changes to any terms or conditions of the Policy, the changes will be posted on this portion of the Site so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, to whom we will disclose it and what choices you have. Any change, modification, addition or removal of portions of this Policy will be announced on our Site at least ten (10) days before it is implemented. Please be sure to check this page before proceeding to use our Site.
