This statement concerns our policy regarding the personal information that we may gather from visitors to our Web sites (all manning.com, manning-sandbox.com and manning-source.com) or from customers who buy directly from us.  It lets you know why we collect information and the things that you can do to control it.

### Why we collect personal information

Manning collects personal information so that we can keep our readers informed.  We use the data to let you know about recent news, upcoming release dates, special offers, events and the like that our customers might wish to hear about.  We also collect anonymous information about how visitors make use of our website, in order to analyze and improve the user experience.

### The information Manning gathers and tracks

Manning collects two types of information:  1) data that is submitted voluntarily by visitors wishing to receive news or product information, to provide us with feedback or to purchase products directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data that we gather while users are interacting with our Web sites.

Manning never sells or rents email addresses or other personally identifiable information that visitors provide.  We will, however, release information in order comply with the law, or when it is appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Manning, our users or others.  It may be necessary for Manning to exchange information with other companies or agencies in the interest of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

### Tracking information

Manning tracks such information as clickstreams, click through, pageviews, and search terms in order to analyze cumulative website usage.  This traffic and demographic data is completely anonymous, is not analyzed or stored in a manner which identifies individual users, and is for internal use only.  We do not share this information with any third parties, ever.

Your browser can be set to block cookies or to give you a warning before accepting them.  You can still use our website even if you block cookies, but certain site features or functions may not be available to you.

No third parties are involved in Manning’s use of cookies.  That means we don’t set third party cookies, share information, or provide tracking support to any third parties.
