### 5\. Cookies

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive.

Each of Our Websites uses cookies from time to time to distinguish you from other users of each of Our Websites. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse each of Our Websites and also allows us to improve each of Our Websites.

For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our [Cookie Policy](http://www.manxtelecom.com/terms-and-conditions/cookie-policy.aspx).

### 6\. Where We Store Your Personal Data

The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Also it will be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

All confidential information you provide to us is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology and may be stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of any of Our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Any modern browser can be used to access our websites with SSL technology.

If you are required to send us your credit or debit card information, your card details will always be transmitted securely using HTTP over SSL (HTTPS). Some details will be encrypted and stored on our servers for the period required for processing. Where a regular or on-demand payment has been requested by you then your card details are stored at our payment provider’s secure facility to be used as necessary.

Any credit and debit card details stored by us are in encrypted form and can only be viewed by employees with the appropriate level of security clearance.

In addition to the steps that we take to protect your personal data, you should take the following steps to help protect yourself against Internet fraud:

  * choose a password you can remember but others will not guess, and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure;
  * when you have finished any session on any of Our Websites, make sure that you prevent your details being seen by any third parties and, if you have registered and logged in, remember to log off;
  * clear any 'cache' so there is no record of any transactions left on screen; and
  * close your browser so any history of the session is cleared.



Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to any of Our Websites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in IM1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
