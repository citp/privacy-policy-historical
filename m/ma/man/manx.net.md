Manx Telecom will not pass your personal details to anyone outside of Manx Telecom. Any information given by Manx Telecom to companies felt by Manx Telecom to be reputable will only be "aggregated" statistics. This means that none of the data includes information that would enable you or any other individual to be identified.

Should Manx Telecom's policy ever change, we will inform you and ask your permission once again before sharing any information.

When you register details with us, for example by opening a Manxnet email address or ordering an E-Biz product, your details are stored on secure servers and software appropriate for the service ordered or requested.

Over and above what Manx Telecom do to safeguard your privacy and security, there are a number of things you can do to protect yourself from Internet fraud:

  * Choose a password you can remember but others will not guess, and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure.

  * When you have finished your session on Manxnet Webmail, make sure that you prevent your details being seen by anyone that you do not wish to see them.  So, if you have logged into this area of Manxnet, remember to log off.  Clear any 'cache' so there is no record of your session left on screen - both Firefox and Internet Explorer let you do this.  We also recommend you then close your browser so any history of the session is cleared.  As an extra precaution, your session on Manxnet Webmail will 'time out' if you have not used the site for 30 minutes.




At Manx Telecom we respect the privacy of personal e-mail accounts and we store your e-mail addresses just as securely as other personal information on Manx-Telecom.com, Pronto.net and Manx.net.  We will not send you unwanted e-mail messages or junk mail, and your details will not be passed to ANY organisation beyond Manx Telecom without your explicit permission.

However, we will use email to send you messages about outstanding orders, faults and service issues.  We may also use email to keep you up to date with news about our current services, as well as anything you show an interest in, either online, or through other contact with Manx Telecom.  We see this as an integral part of signing up for Manxnet mail services.
