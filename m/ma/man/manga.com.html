<h2>PRIVACY POLICY <br>
FOR STARZMEDIA.COM AND MANGA.COM WEB SITES </h2>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. BY USING THE STARZMEDIA.COM
AND MANGA.COM WEB SITES (TOGETHER, THE "SITE") YOU ARE UNCONDITIONALLY
AGREEING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, TOGETHER WITH THE TERMS OF USE FOR THE SITE
(WHICH, TOGETHER SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “AGREEMENT”). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.</strong></p>
<p>Managa.com, owned, operated and/or managed by Starz Media, LLC (“Manga”) is
committed to helping users of its Site understand the information it collects,
how it uses that information, the choices users have about the way their information
is used, and the precautions Manga.com takes to protect information concerning
its users. This Privacy Policy applies specifically to the Site only, and covers
information collected on or through the Site. When using other Starz Media web
sites, we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy controlling that particular
site.</p>
<h3>A. Information We Collect.</h3>
<p>Manga.com collects personally identifiable information that you voluntarily
submit in various contexts including, but not limited to: (1) the registration
or account creation process for the Site; (2) the registration process for sweepstakes,
contests, and other online promotions offered on the Site; (3) your participation
in online research surveys offered on the Site; (4) the process to report a problem
with our Site and resolving customer service activities (including via email
and chat), and (5) in connection with content submissions, voting and polling
activities. Such personally identifiable information may include, without limitation,
name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number.</p>
<p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically collect information that
describes how you use the Site (which pages you visit and how long you stay,
plus the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web browser,
such as browser type, data that identifies the page you visited prior to and
after your visit to the Site, and your IP address). We also may determine what
technology is available through your browser so we can serve you the most appropriate
version of a page.</p>
<p>Cookies are small information files that our Site may place on your computer
to provide extended functionality. We may use cookies for a number of purposes,
such as tracking how visitors use our Site, limiting multiple responses to polls
or surveys, and recording your member registration information. Cookies (including
beacons), by themselves, do not provide Manga.com with personally identifiable
information unless you choose to voluntarily provide this information to us by,
for example, registering on the Site. However, once you choose to furnish us
with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the
data stored in the cookie. You can turn off cookies in your web browser (see
your browser’s manual or help file for instructions), but if you do turn off
cookies you may not be able to access parts of the Site where cookies are used.</p>
<p>You should be aware that advertisers or other third parties serving content
on the Site may set and access their own cookies on your computer. We don’t have
control over cookies placed by third parties. Such third parties’ use of cookies
is subject to their own privacy policies, which may differ from this one. Such
third parties do not have access to our cookies.</p>
<p>An IP address is a number assigned to your computer or network when you’re
on the Internet. It’s usually associated with the place you enter the Internet,
like your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your school. When you visit pages
on our Site, our servers log your IP address. We collect IP addresses for a variety
of internal purposes, such as system administration and to keep track of the
number of visits to different pages on the Site.</p>
<p>While using the Site, you may encounter links to other web sites or online
materials. Those other web sites and any online advertising servers delivering
ads to our Site may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own
privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only
covers information collected by Manga.com, and we encourage you to review the
privacy policy of any other web site you visit.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable information
you may disclose publicly in user forums (such as chat rooms or discussion boards).
When you voluntarily post information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be collected and used by other people to send unsolicited messages
(or “spam”) and marketing materials. Manga.com &nbsp;assumes no responsibility
for any action or policies of any third parties who collect information that
users disclose on discussion boards or in other public areas of the Site.<br>
<br></p>
<h3>B. How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect.</h3>
<p>We use the personal information you give us about yourself to deliver information
or content you request, to contact you about our programs, products, features,
or services, or for other purposes explained at the time we collect the information.
Personally identifiable information is used by Manga.com to, among other things:
(1) verify access rights to premium content or other access-restricted services,
including for purpose of supporting digital rights management software; (2) improve

and/or personalized help and instructions; (3) provide information concerning
compatibility and interoperability to you; (4) ask you to participate in surveys
about products, services, news and events; (5) provide you with news, newsletters,
updates, targeted advertising, promotions, sweepstakes and special offers; (6)
better understand how the Site is used, including web traffic patterns and what
types of content are most popular with users; and (7) in connection with content
submissions, community postings (e.g., chat and bulletin boards), and voting
and polling activities. Manga.com does not sell, rent, lease or license your
personally identifiable information to third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Manga.com may disclose personally identifiable information to third party
agents and affiliates we engage to provide services for Manga.com. Examples include
fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing
data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. Such entities
and individuals are required to protect your personally identifiable information
in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and to not use such personal
information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing
for Manga.com.</p>
<p>Manga.com may disclose your personally identifiable information to any successor
or to any person or entity that acquires ownership or control of the Site, whether
as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of a web
site's assets and/or services or otherwise. You hereby consent to the disclosure
to, and use by, any such successor or subsequent owner or operator, and your
continued use of the Site signifies your agreement to be bound by such successor's
or subsequent owner or operator's own terms of service and privacy policy. Manga.com
is not responsible for any changes or modifications to this Privacy Policy by
any successor or subsequent owner or operator.</p>
<p>We may share your personally identifiable information with companies that
offer products and/or services under the Starz Media brand name. Manga.com may
also share your information with companies that offer products and/or services
that are co-branded using Manga.com brand names. These companies are called “co-branding
participants.”</p>
<p>Manga.com may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties
in the following instances: 1) we have been given your consent to disclose; 2)
we have previously informed you of the disclosure, including by means of our
Privacy Policy; 3) we are required by law or court order to disclose, or we believe
in good faith that the law requires it; 4) disclosure is necessary to identify,
contact, or bring legal action against, someone who may cause or be causing harm
to, or interference with, our rights or property, other Manga.com web site users,
or anyone else; or 5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that you
have made. We may also use IP addresses in cooperation with Internet service
providers to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with laws, to enforce
compliance with the Agreement, including the Privacy Policy, or to protect the
Site, our sites, customers, or others.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>C. How We Use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect.</h3>
<p>We currently contract with online partners to help manage and optimize our
Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company
to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use
the Site. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing
company on the Site. For example, we use cookies to: (1) personalize your experience
when visiting the Site and using the Site; (2) improve the design and content
of the Site and/or the Content; (3) analyze Site usage; (4) understand traffic
patterns on the Site and to authorize access to certain premium or trial content
and product features and (5) track your usage of the Site and/or the Content
and to track your interactions with the Site through the third-party services.
The type of information we collect includes pages visited, content reviewed,
usage levels for content, traffic patterns and other similar usage information.
By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what
pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest
our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our
marketing company logs the information coming from our Site on our behalf, we
control how that data may and may not be used. Manga.com reserves the right to
disclose or otherwise utilize this non-personally identifiable information in
aggregate form, for any purpose, in its sole judgment.</p>

you purchased from us). <br>
