The information passed may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, and gender. </p>
   <p><strong>Publisher Partners</strong> </p>
   <p>When you complete a registration or offer form that is hosted by one of our website publisher partners on our behalf, the website publisher partner may submit all or a portion of the information that you submitted on the form to the Company. This information may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, and payment information; information about your background, interests, health, education, career goals, and shopping preferences; and any other information you provide to our website publisher partner. </p>

   <p><strong>Automatic Information/Digital Identifiers</strong></p>
   <p><strong></strong>We may automatically receive and store certain types of information about you through the data sources listed above.</p>
   <p>You may be familiar with the term “cookies,” which are unique alphanumeric identifiers that store information on your computer. A cookie is placed on your computer when your web browser accesses our website. We use cookies for tracking transactions and the user characteristics explained in detail throughout this Privacy Policy<span style="color:blue; ">. </span>If you choose, there are utilities available for purchase from independent software providers to install on your computer as well as tools/preferences you can choose through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. Of course, cookies let you have a more satisfying website experience, so we recommend that you leave them turned on. </p>
   <p>We also collect information through our web server applications. This information includes your Internet Protocol or “IP” address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.</p>
   <p>Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of transactions with us or our advertisers, the source information for those transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.</p>
   <p><strong>Government Forms</strong></p>
   <p><strong></strong>The Company may be required to create, collect, maintain, and submit certain information required by the government, such as IRS Forms W-9 and 1099. This information, which may include your taxpayer identification number, will not be used, shared, transferred, or sold for marketing purposes. </p>
   <p><strong><a name="link3">HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>
   <p><strong></strong>We may use the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including but not limited to those explained below.</p>
   <p><strong>Upsell</strong> </p>
   <p><span style="color:black; ">We utilize customized post transactional or “upsell” technology to help advertisers generate sales, while providing you with a series of great offers we think may be of interest to you. The way it works is simple: once you purchase a product or service from one of our reward advertisers, you will be offered additional products or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you elect to purchase products or services from an advertiser in the post transactional channel, we will pass the information that you provided during the initial transaction to the subsequent advertiser, including but not limited to your credit card information. This information pass is done to enhance and simplify your purchasing experience. Your information will only be passed to an advertiser in the post transactional channel after you have elected to purchase their product or service. By electing to purchase their product or service you consent to the passing of your data to the third party advertiser in question. </span> </p>
   <p><span style="color:black; "> </span> </p>
   <p><strong>Ad Serving</strong></p>
   <p>We may serve advertisements to you based, in part, on your IP address, the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during the website registration process, and other socio-economic information, psychographic information, Internet behavior (i.e., browsing, search, shopping, purchase, and ad response behavior), and lifestyle information about you that we obtain from affiliated entities and from third parties. </p>
   <p>We also use third party advertising companies, such as Advertising.com, to serve advertisements when you visit our websites. These companies may use and optimize information (not including your name, mailing address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Advertising.com, <a href="http://www.advertising.com/privacy_policy_details.php" target="_blank">click here</a>. </p>
   <p><strong>Pre-select/Pre-fill Offers</strong></p>
   <p>Our website technology may pre-select certain offers for you to view based on the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during the website registration process. Additionally, this technology may pre-fill some or all of the offers’ data fields with the information you submitted during the website registration process in order to prevent you from having to re-enter this information. We may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you. </p>
   <p><strong>Customer Service and Fulfillment</strong></p>
   <p>We may use your information to operate the website promotion, service your account and to fulfill rewards earned through Company websites. We may also use your information to verify your identity or claimed account status and, where we consider appropriate, investigate your compliance with the terms and conditions of the website promotion or any advertiser offer. We do retain customer service correspondence. </p>
   <p><strong>Credit Card Preauthorization</strong></p>

   <p>We may use your information in our online (<em>e.g.</em>, e-mail marketing) and offline (<em>e.g.</em>, telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs. If you would like to be removed from these programs, <u><span style="color:blue; "><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(' http://www.managingbipolardisorder.net/contact.cgi?config=6178&amp;email=&amp;email;&amp;showme=unsub','','scrollbars=yes,width=600,height=402')">click here</a></span></u> and follow the opt-out instructions.</p>
   <p><strong><a name="link4">HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>
   <p>We may share the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including but not limited to those explained below. </p>

With respect to online behavioral advertising, certain affiliated companies may use non-personally identifiable information (which may or may not include click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) collected during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.

The information passed to these companies may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, and any other information you provide to us. Web pages that are served by these companies will state that they are “powered by” or “ads by” the applicable company and will contain a link to that company’s privacy policy. </p>
   <p><strong>Marketing Partners</strong></p>
   <p>We may share, license or sell your information to third parties for various marketing purposes, including their online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs.

   <p><strong>Governmental Agencies or Other Companies</strong></p>
   <p>We may share your information with law enforcement officials or governmental agencies: (1) in response to their request; (2) when permitted or required by law; or (3) to establish our compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or guidelines. </p>
   <p>We may store and share your information with third parties for suppression or opt-out purposes. </p>
