### **Privacy Policy**

**Automatic Logging**

  * The webserver automatically logs any connections to the website. All of the data sent via the URL, the IP of the client and the time of the connection is kept. This is used for statistical analysis to determine the surfing habits of our visitors. The information collected is periodically rotated. 




**Personally identifiable information**

  * Upon subscription to our newsletter, the website collects the full name of the subscriber, the supplied email address and the IP address of the subscriber. The information is used in the personnalisation of our emails and in tracing records should an email address become invalid. The IP address is used as a proof of the identity of the subscriber. If an email address is used to send a SPAM complaint through various channels, we will use the collected IP address and information from the double opt-in process as proof of subscription.
  * If you place an order with us, we will also collect your mailing and your billing address and your telephone numbers. They are used to get the order to you and to contact you in case there is a problem. You credit card information is also collected to process the payment for the order. It will be deleted once all installments are paid. 
  * If you ordered from us and you wish to review the information and/or update it, you can do so by clicking on "Members Login" on the menubar at the bottom of our header.
  * No information is shared with third parties



**Tracking technology**

  * Tracking is used once a user logs in or signup in the order process. It allows to keep track of the login session and is not used for other purposes.
  * Every email includes a customized header referencing the record number of the email address and a customized link for unsubscriptions. They are used to track bounce and to identify who is unsubscribing.



**Security measures**

  * SSL encrypted webpages are used when personnal information is collected during the order process.
