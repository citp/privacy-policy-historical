You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites 

MaxMouth permits other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the MaxMouth Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the MaxMouth Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.  
MaxMouth does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks . However, please note that if an advertiser asks MaxMouth to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement by clicking the ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the MaxMouth Sites that they collect by virtue of you clicking through on an ad,(such as the number of times you viewed an ad), to determine which ads to deliver to you.  
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks  for more information on their practices. MaxMouth's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
