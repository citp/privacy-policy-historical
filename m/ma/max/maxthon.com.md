# Privacy Policy | Maxthon Browser

## General

We, at Maxthon, highly value your privacy and it is one of our top priorities. We strictly protect the security of your data and protect it from disclosure, with certain exceptions only granted when requested by law or court order.

This privacy statement is intended to help you understand what data we collect, how and why we collect it and how we use it. However, this Policy only applies to Maxthon's browser products and our own websites. We encourage you to refer to the privacy statements of the third-party links, websites and apps/products that you may access and use from Maxthon's browser products or our own website.

This is important. We hope you take time to read it carefully.

## Maxthon's Websites

When you visit Maxthon's websites, we may collect visitor statistics. These may include information about the visitors' IP-addresses, usage patterns, the time at which users visit our page, and information about the browser and operating system used. This information is solely for statistical purpose and is not used to identify individuals. We use these statistics to improve and optimize the usability of our products and services for our users. They help us determine where we need to improve and prioritize our resources accordingly. We may also share these statistics with our partners to show them our users' behavior at a macro level.

Our websites may use cookies. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you as a visitor when you return to the website using the same computer and web browser. This allows us to provide a more customized experience for our visitors. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser. 

Maxthon and our partners may use cookies, “Web Beacon”, “Clear GIF” and other technologies to analyze if our users have seen relevant content (such as ads) and how they react to the content. But we won't collect personal identifiable information about you.

### How do we learn information about you?

We learn information about you when:

  * you use our products and services; for example, when your installed Maxthon browser checks with us to see if it is up to date;

  * we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us; for example, when we use your IP address to customize the language option for some of our services.




### What and why do we collect?

When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. Please note that we use your data and information for statistical purpose, not for identifying individuals. We use these statistics to improve and optimize the usability of our products and services for our users. They help us determine where we need to improve and prioritize our resources accordingly.

Generally, we collect information about you to help us:

  * Study and personalize user experiences;

  * Fulfill legal requirements;

  * Conduct business analysis and research, and marketing campaigns;

Here you can see a list of the information about you we may collect and why we collect it. Please note that the information we collect may vary, depending on the product or service you use. And to ensure basic user experience, we help you by enabling Smart Address Bar, Secure URLs Scan and Smart Dual-core Switch by default. You have the option to disable these in the browser settings.

Search and browsing history | 

Smart Address Bar will store your search and browsing history with multiple encryption technology so that our browser or the search engine you use for suggestion services can smartly display the websites you may want to visit and provide suggested websites and trending content you may like.   
  
Smart Dual-core Switch | 

Maxthon is the first browser in the world to deploy this Dual-core Switch technology. Through a code-level analysis of the website, Maxthon recognizes which core is capable of best rendering it. 

This feature enabled, Maxthon will store the anonymous website and correspondent core data on our server.

To localize our product and service;  
To help you verify the use of your account;

To gain statistical insight and not to identify individuals. 

Maxthon gives you the option to share your location with a site. Maxthon won't allow a site to access your location without your permission. Please be cautious when sharing your location with a site, because Maxthon does not have control over third-party websites or their privacy practices.   
  
URLs | 

If you enabled Secure URLs Scan, we will scan and check the security of the website you visit and send notifications or alerts for malicious websites. 

We don't store the websites scanned and we don't share that information with any third parties. 

Because of this security check, we have prevented our users from visiting millions of fake and malicious websites since 2005.   
  
Information about other software installed  | 

The security, stability and compatibility of the browser can be affected by other software in the system. Some malicious software manipulates the browser startpage the user has set. Some of them create compatibility conflicts with the browser due to version update. To ensure Maxthon browser performs well, we occasionally collects anonymous information on the software installed in the system.   
  
UEIP (User Experience Improvement Program) | 

Maxthon implements a User Experience Improvement Program (UEIP), a standard industry practice to improve the user experience. Users have full control when it comes to opting in or out of the UEIP. If a user opts out, the UEIP will not collect information. 

After joining UEIP and using a stable version of our browser, we collect anonymous basic browser usage data to facilitate our browser development. In developer versions (including insider preview versions, test versions and other special versions), all data feedback options are enabled to send in all browser usage data to help us fix and improve usability.   
  
Private session | 

In private session, you may limit the data that our browser collects and stores about you, including, but not limited to: basic browsing history and download history. 

**Cookies:** In private session, Maxthon doesn't share cookies stored with new websites. These websites may generate new cookies in your system but will only be stored and uploaded after the private session is closed. 

**Browser settings modification:** The modifications you make to the browser settings will be saved. These modifications are not affected by private sessions. 

**Profile data:** You can still use your profile data such as saved passwords in private session.

### How do we protect your information?

We are committed to protecting your data once we have it. We implement physical and technical security measures designed especially for that. 

Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps. But over the 10 years of Maxthon's presence in this industry, there has NEVER been one privacy leak incident, not once. 

### Access

Maxthon has strict restrictions on access to user data. Only a limited and restricted number of our employees has access to it. This also includes employees for our web hosting service providers.

### What else do you need to know?

Maxthon is a global company and our computers/servers are located in several different places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be in various countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.

### Reviews

Procedures are reviewed regularly to ensure that the policies are followed. Any non-conformance regarding the policies will be corrected without unnecessary delay.
