# Privacy Policy

## MAXIMUS Privacy Policy

Effective August 17, 2009

## Our Commitment to Privacy

MAXIMUS, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "MAXIMUS") respects your privacy and we have developed the following policy to demonstrate our commitment to you. This privacy policy applies to personally identifiable information we collect about you on the MAXIMUS website located at [www.maximus.com](http://www.maximus.com/) (the “Site”) and describes the types of information collected, how that information is used, and the choices users have about collection and use of this information. This privacy policy does not govern privacy practices associated with offline activities, Web sites other than the Site, or products and services not available or enabled via the Site, except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

Although much of the Site is available without registration or providing personal information, in order to take advantage of some of our Site’s features, you will be asked to provide personal information. This personal information is provided voluntarily by you, the user, in order to participate or register for a particular product or service, or when you otherwise communicate with us or the Site. Personal information will be collected at various pages on the Site, including when you:

  * Submit an online inquiry 
  * Submit an investor relations information request 
  * Sign up for e-mail alerts, newsletters, and other MAXIMUS information 
  * Submit an employment application



We clearly identify data you must provide so we can deliver the services or information you request. MAXIMUS may ask that you provide personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP/Postal code), country of residence, e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone numbers, and other personal information. Providing this information is optional, but failure to do so in some cases will limit the services available to you.

In addition, our Web servers automatically collect and log Web usage data from you when you visit the Site. This information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, referring sites, pages viewed, browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit Web pages, and length of visit, informs us about how visitors use and navigate the Site.

## How We Use and Share the Information Collected

MAXIMUS does not share your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, but we may use your information to, among other things:

  * Provide newsletters and information about MAXIMUS 
  * Provide the information or service requested or otherwise respond to your inquiries 
  * Improve the content, navigation, and efficiency of the Site 
  * Make you aware of other benefits, products, services or events offered by MAXIMUS that may interest you 
  * Enforce the MAXIMUS Terms of Use and otherwise prevent illegal or improper activity related to the Site 
  * Notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy or to other policies that may affect you and your use of the Site 



In order to respond to an information request you submit through the Site, we may share your personal information with our affiliated companies that may be able to respond directly to your inquiry. In addition, we may disclose your information to third parties (1) in connection with a merger, sale or consolidation of all or substantially all our assets, or (2) to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. By using this Site, you agree and acknowledge that personal information collected through the Site may be transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in any of the countries around the world in which MAXIMUS maintains offices, including the United States.

We may use and share with others aggregated or anonymous (not personally identifiable) information that we have collected based on Web usage data, surveys, or statistical information that we have compiled about our users.

## Cookies

Like most websites, we employ "cookies", "Web beacons", and similar devices to help users more efficiently use the Site and to track your activities. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables MAXIMUS to record your activities and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. Cookies from MAXIMUS can only be read by MAXIMUS websites. A Web beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or e-mail used to track when the page or e-mail has been viewed. MAXIMUS uses cookies and similar devices to track your use of the Site, types of Products and Services viewed and information downloaded, count visitors we receive daily, and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer. MAXIMUS does not generally use this information to identify you personally. If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can modify the cookie option in your browser’s settings. However, some Site features or services may not function properly or be accessible without cookies.
