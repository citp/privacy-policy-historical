Also, this Privacy Policy covers Maxxis’s treatment of any information, including personally identifiable information, that Maxxis’s business partners share with Maxxis. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Maxxis does not own or control, or to individuals that Maxxis does not employ or manage. 

**TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR**

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers. 

_Personally Identifiable Information You Provide to Us_ : 

Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, Maxxis only collects personally identifiable information (information that identifies one individual from another) that you voluntarily provide to us. The types of personally identifiable information collected include: your first and last name; your physical address or postal address; your phone number; your credit card number; your credit card expiration date; your credit card security ID number; your email address; the date your account was opened; and details regarding your purchases. 

This information is used for purposes such as: creating your Maxxis account; billing your credit card when you make a purchase; crediting your credit card in the event that we issue you a refund; sending marketing communications and purchase confirmations to you (unless you have elected not to receive such information); sending surveys to you; responding to your requests for certain products and services; customizing the advertising and content you see; communicating with you about specials and new products; and improving the quality of your visit to the Maxxis Web site. 

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. 

_Aggregate Data_ : 

We automatically collect and store the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet protocol address of the computer you are using, the browser software and the operating system you are using, the date and time you access our site, the areas of our site that you visit, and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked to our site. This data is anonymous in nature and does not contain any personally identifiable information. 

Maxxis only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use areas of the Web site or services, so that we can make the Web site appealing to as many customers as possible and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Web site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.
