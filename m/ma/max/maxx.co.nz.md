## 4\. What about cookies?

"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's device’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The cookie assigns that device an ID that allows Auckland Transport to recognise it when it is used to access an Auckland Transport website.

We use cookies on Auckland Transport websites to collect standard internet log information and details of our visitors’ behaviour patterns in order to obtain statistics of the number of visits and the popular parts of those website. These statistics are gathered and used solely for the purposes of analysing, evaluating and improving the content of Auckland Transport’s websites.

## 5\. Will my personal information be protected?

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment protected from unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure.

## 6\. How is my information retained and stored?

We may retain all personal information that we collect (on both our active systems and our archive systems), for as long as is necessary for us to carry out the purposes for which the information was collected (including for the purpose of providing services to you). For registration and account information, this means that the information is likely to be retained for the period of time that we consider your account (registered card or online account) to be "active". An "inactive" card is where the card is not used and no Stored Value or Period Passes are added to the card for a continuous period of 2 years.

The location at which we store your personal information will depend on the nature and purpose of the information and the manner in which you supply it to us. We may use, process, and store your personal information at our premises and/or storage facilities (whether in New Zealand or overseas).

## 7\. Can I access my personal information?
