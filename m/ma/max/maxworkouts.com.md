# MAX WORKOUTS: Privacy Policy

Updated 12/2015

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OR ACCESSING ANY PART OF THE Max Workouts WEBSITE OR ITS SERVICES.**

This Privacy Policy applies to the websites and services provided by Max Workouts, Inc. ("us" or "we"), including the websites located at www.maxworkouts.com and www.maxworkoutclub.com. This Policy outlines the information we collect, why we collect it, how we use and disclose this information (and the choices you have to review, revise and/or restrict our usage of it), and how you can contact us. Your use of the Max Workouts websites and services are also governed by the Max Workouts Terms of Service.

### Information we collect and how we use it

In order to improve our website and ultimately your experience with us, we collect information from you in two ways:

  1. Information you give us
  2. Information we collect from your use of our website



### Information you give us:

When you place an order, we collect your name, email address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date (this information is considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII)). When you sign up for a promotion, contest, free report, or email newsletter, we collect your name and email address. We may also collect any other information you voluntarily provide to us.

We use this information to process any transaction, inquiry or promotion that you initiate with us, notify you of your order status, provide you with customer support, communicate with you about products, services, or promotions that we or our partners offer, including those that we think may be of particular interest to you based on information we have collected, or for any other lawful purpose. We may contact you via email, telephone, text message, or otherwise regarding your account or for marketing purposes. We may also disclose your contact information to companies that offer products or services we believe you may be interested. Those companies may contact you for marketing purposes through email, telephone, or text message, depending on the contact information you provided to us. For example, we may disclose your email address to our partners, including BioTrust Nutrition, and they may periodically send you marketing emails. You may opt-out of receiving those emails by following the opt-out instructions in the email.

You have the ability to unsubscribe from future email messages at any time (simply click the "Manage Subscriptions" link located at the bottom of any email you receive from us, then choose the email list(s) you want to unsubscribe from).

We may use third-party companies to perform services on our behalf. This may include companies that personalize our websites, analyze our usage data, process credit card transactions, or collect debts. These companies may have access to your information, but are not permitted to use your information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.

We reserve the right to disclose personal information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law, if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to establish or exercise legal rights, or in situations involving potential threats to physical safety.

In the event that Max Workouts is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right, to sell or otherwise transfer any and all information we have collected from you as part of that transaction and such third party will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Policy.

This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page or the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to the maxworkouts.com website. maxworkouts.com also uses Google AdWords Display Network for advertising which tracks demographic and interest information for target marketing of our advertising campaigns.
