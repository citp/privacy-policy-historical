If so, we rely on you to inform these individuals that you are providing their personal information to us, to make sure they consent to you giving us their information and to advise them about where they can find a copy of this Privacy Statement (on our website at [www.maxis.com.my](http://www.maxis.com.my/)). 

_**5\. TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE MALAYSIA**_

It may be necessary for Maxis to transfer your personal information outside Malaysia if any of Maxis’ service providers or strategic partners (“overseas entities”) involved in providing part of a Maxis Product or Service are located in countries outside Malaysia or if you use the Product or Service from a country other than Malaysia (for example, international roaming). You hereby consent to Maxis transferring your personal information outside Malaysia in these instances.
