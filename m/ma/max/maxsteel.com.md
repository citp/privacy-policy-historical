We adhere to local definitions of “children” for Mattel Services located in jurisdictions where the age is different.

 **Information.** Data we collect. It includes, in alphabetical order:

  *  **Automatically collected information.** Information automatically collected when you use Mattel Services, including information to facilitate your experience and help us understand our visitors, like your device information, information about the network you are using to access Mattel Services (such as preferred language or online sites or services visited before you visit a Mattel Service), and content (including ads) that you see or click on.

 **Do Not Sell My Personal Information**

Subject to certain exceptions, as a California resident, you have the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information. To opt out of the "sale" of your personal information as described in this section, please visit the [DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION (ADCHOICES)](https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/?type=mattelccpa&pid=mattel01&aid=mattel01) page where you may take the following steps:

Keep in mind that, if you opt out of interest-based advertising, you may still see customized advertising displayed by advertising networks from which you have not opted out. In addition, your opt out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you.

  *  _Mobile Apps_ : For the "sale" of personal information collected on our mobile apps through the use of certain advertising technologies, you may opt out by using the feature for limiting ad tracking on your device (if available) or, as applicable, by using the instructions found in the settings of the app.

Keep in mind that, if you opt out of interest-based advertising, your opt out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. Please also note that you may need to revisit such choices if you reset your phone or otherwise turn ad tracking back on in your device settings.

  

  *  _Catalogue_ : For the “sale” of personal information that occurs when we share certain names and mailing addresses of American Girl catalogue recipients with third parties as described above, you may opt out of the “sale” by providing us with your email address, first and last name and mailing address as detailed in the [DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION (ADCHOICES)](https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/?type=mattelccpa&pid=mattel01&aid=mattel01) page.
