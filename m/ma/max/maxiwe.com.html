<p>Privacy Policy for maxiwe.com</p>
<p align="left">The privacy of our visitors to maxiwe.com is important to us.</p>
<p align="left">At maxiwe.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal  information is important. Here is information on what types of personal  information we receive and collect when you use and visit maxiwe.com,  and how we safeguard your information.&nbsp; We never sell your personal  information to third parties.</p>
<p align="left">Log Files<br>
  As with most other websites, we collect and use the  data contained in log files.&nbsp; The information in the log files include&nbsp;  your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service  provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our  site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our  site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</p>
<p align="left">Cookies and Web Beacons<br>
  We do use cookies to store information,  such as your personal preferences when you visit our site.&nbsp; This could  include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to  login to some of our features, such as forums.</p>
<p align="left">We also use third party advertisements on maxiwe.com to support our  site.&nbsp; Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and  web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these  advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program)  information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used  to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash  installed.&nbsp; This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing  New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or  showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing  cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>
<p align="left">DoubleClick DART cookies<br>
  We also may use DART cookies for ad  serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your  computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using  DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense  advertisements).&nbsp; This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and  your interests (”interest based targeting”).&nbsp; The ads served will be  targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you  have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas  hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site  about hockey).&nbsp; DART uses “non personally identifiable information”.&nbsp;  It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name,  email address, physical address, telephone number, social security  numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.&nbsp; You can opt-out  of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or  third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing  preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; However,  this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as  other websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability to login to services  or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>
<p align="left">Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any  advertising program.&nbsp; Unless you have settings that disallow cookies,  the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie  will be added.</p>
