                  <p>This Privacy Statement is applicable to all SONY Entertainment 
                    Television (SET) Web sites and other sites on the Internet 
                    and World Wide Web owned and operated by SET (the "SET 
                    Sites"), and all services provided thereon, including 
                    all SET Forums (collectively, unless noted otherwise, the 
                    "Services"). </p>
                  <p>SET respects the privacy concerns of all users of the Services. 
                    SET also recognizes the valuable potential of technology to 
                    help people communicate with the companies whose Web sites 
                    they visit, particularly through customer databases. Responsible 
                    use of the information you share with SET is paramount. In 
                    order to help you understand how the information you provide 
                    SET will be used, the following guidelines have been created.</p>
                  <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information: </b></p>
                  <p>In order to use certain portions of the Services, you may 
                    be required to register and create an account with SET ("SETIZENS 
                    Account"). There is no cost to create a SETIZENS Account but 
                    you will be asked to choose a SETIZNES ID, password, and provide 
                    certain personal information about yourself, such as your 
                    real name, age, address, telephone number, occupation and 
                    e-mail address. If you do provide SET with personally identifiable 
                    information, we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps 
                    to protect this information. SET will not disclose, share, 
                    sell or rent personally identifiable information to any third 
                    party without your prior consent except to authorise third 
                    party/agencies to collect, maintain and share data on our 
                    behalf.<br>
                    <br>
                    Please note that your member name will be available to other 
                    members of the SET community while you participate in certain 
                    SET Forums or Events. You may access, edit or delete your 
                    information given for your SETIZENS ID. </p>
                  <p>Other than registration information, you may be asked to 
                    provide certain personal information in connection with your 
                    use of or participation in certain promotions such as entering 
                    sweepstakes, contests, surveys, newsletters, etc, ("Special 
                    Promotions"). In these instances, you will be informed 
                    of the intended use(s) of the requested information.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b></p>
                  <p>As part of the registration process to create a SETIZENS 
                    Account or to participate in a Special Promotion, you may 
                    be asked to provide certain information about yourself which 
                    does not personally identify you. For example, you may be 
                    asked to provide information concerning your music or other 
                    entertainment preferences, purchasing habits, and the like. 
                    SET requests this information in order to enhance your online 
                    experience by understanding you better and to also make you 
                    aware of new services, programs or offers in which you may 
                    be interested. </p>
                  <p>In general, you can use the Services (except SET Contests) 
                    while remaining anonymous. However, in some cases, SET may 
                    still be able to collect certain non-personally identifiable 
                    information about your use of the Services. For example, SET 
                    might collect information concerning the type of Internet 
                    browser you are using, the type of computer operating system 
                    you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider 
                    and/or the Web site or advertisement from which you linked 
                    to the SET site.</p>
                  <p>When you visit one of the SET Sites or advertisements appearing 
                    thereon, or use one or more of the Services, we may use an 
                    industry-wide technology called "cookies" which 
                    stores certain information on your computer and which will 
                    allow us to customize your experience to better match your 
                    interests and preferences or simply facilitate your signing 
                    in to use the Services. Most browsers will allow you to erase 
                    cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of 
                    cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please 
                    refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn 
                    more about these functions.</p>
                  <p>In general, SET may use non-personally identifiable information 
                    to improve and enhance the Services. However, from time to 
                    time, SET may share this information with other entities in 
                    aggregate, non-personal form to show general demographic and 
                    preference information among users of the SET Sites. </p>
                  <p><b>Other sensitive information:</b></p>
                  <p>Whenever you give SET sensitive information (e.g., credit 
                    card numbers), SET will take all commercially reasonable steps 
                    to protect such information by establishing a secure connection 
                    with your Web browser. SET employs an industry-wide technology 
                    known as a secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect 
                    the transmission of payment information to the Site. Unless 
                    otherwise specified herein, credit card numbers are used only 
                    for payment processing and are not retained for marketing 
                    or any other purposes.</p>
                  <p><b>Postings to Forums:</b></p>
                  <p>All postings, whether in a chat room, on message boards or 
                    other method of communication within the Forums will generally 
                    be available to and freely accessible by other users of the 
                    SET Forums. Therefore, users should not expect that any information 
                    they post will be kept private or confidential and are encouraged 
                    to exercise discretion when using the SET Forums. Additionally, 
                    your member name may also be posted in conjunction with your 
                    post in the SET Forums.</p>
                  <p><b>Hyperlinks:</b></p>
                  <p>The SET Sites may contain links to or advertisements concerning 
                    other Web sites. Other sites may also reference, advertise,
