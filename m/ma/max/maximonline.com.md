# MAXIM ONLINE: Privacy Policy

**PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.**

As used herein, the phrase "this Site" refers to maximonline.com and other sites on the World Wide Web originating in the United States which are owned and/or operated by MaximNet, Inc. and Felix Dennis (collectively "Maxim"). By using this Site, you indicate your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, you have no right or license to access this Site and you should not do so.

Maxim reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise update this Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, updates or additions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to, posting on this Site, or by electronic or conventional mail, or by any other means by which you obtain notice thereof. Your use of this Site after such notice shall be deemed to constitute your acceptance of such changes, modifications, updates or additions.

Maxim understands and respects your desire for privacy. To that end, we would like you to know how we use the personal information you provide to us.

We collect certain personally identifying information (such as your name and address) that is necessary to fulfill magazine subscriptions. We collect other information (such as your age and e-mail address) so that we may communicate more efficiently with subscribers when necessary, as well as during registration for certain portions of sites in which guests participate in interactive online activities (e.g., surveys, chat rooms, games, or bulletin boards). In addition, other information (such as your credit card number) is collected when you purchase a product from a provider found on this Site. As described below, we may use such information to fulfill prizes or track customer usage of the sites, or for promotional and marketing purposes.

**POLICY FOR MINORS**

Children should always ask parents for permission before providing any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted at this Site by any Minor (a guest under 18 years of age), without the consent of their parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not provide any personally identifying information about Minors, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. No personally identifying information collected from Minors is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever. Minors are not allowed to participate in contests.

**POLICY FOR ADULT GUESTS**

For guests over 18 years of age, Maxim collects personal information in order to provide you with a personalized online experience and to provide our advertisers a way to reach the right audience. With the permission of a guest who is 18 years of age or over, information submitted at the time of Registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by us and may be shared with companies that have been prescreened by us for these purposes. The information is also used to better serve our advertisers.

**PUBLIC FORUMS**

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online in chat rooms, message boards or similar posting areas, the information can be reviewed and collected by anyone. Therefore, do not post any information that you do not want to be made available to the general public. Maxim is not responsible for unsolicited communications that arise from your postings on this Site.

**PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS FROM THIS SITE**

If you purchase a product from this Site, we will collect information from you, including your credit card and contact information, for use by the provider of the product. Unless otherwise stated, Maxim does not have any responsibility in connection with such purchases and all transactions and use of any customer information are the sole responsibility of the product provider. Be sure to review the product provider's privacy policy and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy terms that differ from Maxim's Privacy Policy.

**USE OF IP ADDRESSES**

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When a guest requests pages from our site, our servers log the guest's IP address. The IP addresses are collected for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a guest's session will be logged, but the identity of the guest remains anonymous.

**USE OF COOKIES**

In cyberspace, cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.

Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at a site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites.

By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not and help in targeting ads based on guest interests. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.

A cookie lets the computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, the stores hosted by us usually use a cookie to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. Letting it do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. We never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

Advertising networks that serve ads onto our sites may also use cookies. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our policies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. If you have any additional questions or concerns pertaining to the privacy of information collected on this Site, send an e-mail to us at [feedback@maximonline.com](mailto:feedback@maximonline.com)
