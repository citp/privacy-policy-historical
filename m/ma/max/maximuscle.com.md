## Where we Store your Personal Information and How it is kept secure

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain of our website (i.e. your account), you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 

Some of the information you provide to us will be transmitted electronically (e.g. information provided via our website or email). We would remind you that the information transmitted via the internet is not completely secure and although we will do our best to protect any information transmitted in this way, we cannot guarantee its complete security.

We have put in place appropriate measures to prevent your Personal Information from being accidentally lost, accessed or used in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. 

Some Personal Information you have provided to us is stored on secure servers located in the United Kingdom and on the Cloud. 

We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). 

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator (the Information Commissioner in the UK) of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 

## Your Rights in relation to the Personal Information we Hold

You have the right to:

**Request access** to your Personal Information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

**Request correction** of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.

**Request erasure of your personal information.** This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 

**Object to processing of your Personal Information** where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**Request restriction of processing of your personal information.** This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the information's accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 

**Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party.** We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 

**Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information.** However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
