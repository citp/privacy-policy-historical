<h1 style="text-transform: uppercase">Max Workouts Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><small>Updated 12/2015</small></p>
<p style="text-transform:uppercase"><strong>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OR ACCESSING ANY PART OF THE Max Workouts WEBSITE OR ITS SERVICES.</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the websites and services provided by Max Workouts, Inc. ("us" or "we"), including the websites located at www.maxworkouts.com and www.maxworkoutclub.com. This Policy outlines the information we collect, why we collect it, how we use and disclose this information (and the choices you have to review, revise and/or restrict our usage of it), and how you can contact us. Your use of the Max Workouts websites and services are also governed by the Max Workouts Terms of Service.</p>
<h3>Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<p>In order to improve our website and ultimately your experience with us, we collect information from you in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information you give us</li>
<li>Information we collect from your use of our website</li>
</ol>
<h3>Information you give us:</h3>
<p>When you place an order, we collect your name, email address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date (this information is considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII)). When you sign up for a promotion, contest, free report, or email newsletter, we collect your name and email address. We may also collect any other information you voluntarily provide to us.</p>
<p>We use this information to process any transaction, inquiry or promotion that you initiate with us, notify you of your order status, provide you with customer support, communicate with you about products, services, or promotions that we or our partners offer, including those that we think may be of particular interest to you based on information we have collected, or for any other lawful purpose. We may contact you via email, telephone, text message, or otherwise regarding your account or for marketing purposes. We may also disclose your contact information to companies that offer products or services we believe you may be interested. Those companies may contact you for marketing purposes through email, telephone, or text message, depending on the contact information you provided to us. For example, we may disclose your email address to our partners, including BioTrust Nutrition, and they may periodically send you marketing emails. You may opt-out of receiving those emails by following the opt-out instructions in the email.</p>
<p>You have the ability to unsubscribe from future email messages at any time (simply click the "Manage Subscriptions" link located at the bottom of any email you receive from us, then choose the email list(s) you want to unsubscribe from).</p>
<p>We may use third-party companies to perform services on our behalf. This may include companies that personalize our websites, analyze our usage data, process credit card transactions, or collect debts. These companies may have access to your information, but are not permitted to use your information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose personal information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law, if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to establish or exercise legal rights, or in situations involving potential threats to physical safety.</p>
<p>In the event that Max Workouts is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right, to sell or otherwise transfer any and all information we have collected from you as part of that transaction and such third party will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Policy.</p>
<h3>Information we collect from your use of our website:</h3>
<p>Information is collected from your cookies, IP address, pixel tags, and browsers upon visiting the site. We may aggregate the collected information related to your use of the websites or services. Analyzing the customer data shows us how you interact with our website and content. By tracking usage patterns from customers, we're able to make adjustments to our web pages to improve your user experience and overall quality of the site. It also helps to facilitate our advertising efforts by targeting potential customers who have interests in our product. Some examples of collected data may include device information, location, date of visit, duration on website, demographic information, language, and interest information. We collect this data through third party websites, including Google Analytics. We may use any collected data for any of the purposes stated above, or for any other lawful purpose.</p>
<h3>Third party website analytics and use of cookies, and advertising</h3>
<p>We may use Google Analytics or other analytics providers to help us statistically analyze how users interact with the site. The tool uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including IP address) is transmitted to the analytics provider. This information is then used to evaluate visitors of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity for maxworkouts.com.
</p><p>This website uses the Google AdWords Remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to reach people who previously visited our website. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page or the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to the maxworkouts.com website. <span style="text-transform: capitalize">maxworkouts.com</span> also uses Google AdWords Display Network for advertising which tracks demographic and interest information for target marketing of our advertising campaigns. None if this data collected can be linked or associated with your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for advertising or remarketing purposes. Any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.
</p><p>For information on how Google collects and uses the information collected through our use of the Google analytics and advertising services, see the Google, Inc. Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p><p>For more information about the Google analytics features used by Max Workouts, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" target="_blank">click here</a>.

</p><p>However, we do not guarantee that adjusting your Google preferences or otherwise using Google's products or add-ons will prevent the collection of your information. We do not guarantee that we will take action in response to do-not-track signals or similar mechanisms.
</p><h3>Message boards (forums) &amp; comments</h3>
<p><span style="text-transform: capitalize">maxworkouts.com</span> posts articles and blogs where you may have the option to comment. You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards, forums, comment areas on blog or article posts, or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this policy.</p>
<h3>Children's privacy</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from children under the age of 18. If we learn that we have PII on a child under the age of 18, we will delete that information from our systems. We encourage parents to go online with their kids to help them determine which types of websites are appropriate.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the information we collect on the Max Workouts websites and services. Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% effective. Accordingly, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. You are responsible for restricting access to your computer or mobile device through which you access the Services. Users of public or shared computers or unprotected mobile devices should log out at the completion of each visit to our services. By using the services, or providing personal information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of these services.</p>
