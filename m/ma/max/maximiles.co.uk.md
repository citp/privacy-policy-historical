# ipoints - Privacy Policy

ipoints are committed to our members privacy and the following notes outline our information practices. If you feel we are not abiding by our policy or if you have any questions please contact [info@ipoints.co.uk](mailto:info@ipoints.co.uk).

##### Personal Information

1. We collect basic personal information (Name, Address, Region, DOB, Gender, Marital Status, email address etc.) from you as part of our registration process to enable us set up your ipoints account.

2. In addition we collect information on your preferences when you complete our on-line questionnaire and our ipolls.

3. We also collect information on your shopping & online activities with our partners as part of allocating ipoints to your account.

4. From time to time we may also ask for additional personal information as part of a promotion/competition.

5. Refer a Friend: If you provide us with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data including sensitive personal data and that you have informed them of our identity and the purpose for which their personal data will be processed.

##### Use of Information

1. By joining the ipoints Programme you agree that we can communicate with you with suitable offers from ipoints, its partners and clients, which may contain opportunities to earn and redeem.

2. From time to time we may pass your postal, email address or telephone number on to selected third parties so that they can send you offers that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving all third party communications at any time by ticking the box provided on your Account Details page.

3. The collection of data by ipoints through registration on third party sites may lead to your data also being held by that third party site.

4.

Please email: [feedback@ipoints.co.uk](mailto:feedback@ipoints.co.uk).

5. In order to credit your ipoints account with ipoints gained from earning with our partners or clients, it may be necessary for our partners to transfer your data back to ipoints so we can credit your account to accurately reflect your ipoints total. There may be times when the transfer of data will take place with a partner outside of the EEA. This is for contractual purposes only and again for us to be able to credit your account appropriately.

6. We may collect personal data from other sources in order for us to hold a more accurate profile of the data subject.
