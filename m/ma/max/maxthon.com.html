                                The security, stability and compatibility of the browser can be affected by other software in the system. Some malicious software manipulates the browser startpage the user has set. Some of them create compatibility conflicts with the browser due to version update.

                                Maxthon implements a User Experience Improvement Program (UEIP), a standard industry practice to improve the user experience. Users have full control when it comes to opting in or out of the UEIP. If a user opts out, the UEIP will not collect information.

                                After joining UEIP and using a stable version of our browser, we collect anonymous basic browser usage data to facilitate our browser development. In developer versions (including insider preview versions, test versions and other special versions), all data feedback options are enabled to send in all browser usage data to help us fix and improve usability.                             </p>
