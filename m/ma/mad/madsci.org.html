MadSci Network is a non-profit organization devoted to promoting
science literacy and encouraging an interest in science, both
at the K-12 level, and in the general population. All pages within
MadSci Network will have madsci.org or 68.178.166.78
as the server address, and no tilde (~) in the
path of the URL. Paths containing a tilde refer to home pages
of some scientists participating in the administration of the site.

manner(s):
	</p><ul>

	added or removed from our existing list.

	of students submitting questions, and types of questions received.
	</li><li> Identify commonly asked questions, and create Frequently-Asked-Question
	files (FAQs) to address them.
	</li><li> We will also use this information to trouble-shoot errors or problems in
	our interfaces.
	</li><li> In addition, we may opt to supply this information to a user's identified
