# MadSci Privacy Policy

MadSci Network is a non-profit organization devoted to promoting science literacy and encouraging an interest in science, both at the K-12 level, and in the general population. All pages within MadSci Network will have madsci.org or 68.178.166.78 as the server address, and no tilde (~) in the path of the URL. Paths containing a tilde refer to home pages of some scientists participating in the administration of the site. 

When visiting MadSci Network we may record information regarding the materials accessed. This information is not sold nor shared with third parties, or make publically available, unless you enter specific information on our ask-a-question form (see below). 

All hits to madsci.org generate the following information in our server logs: 

  * The Internet address, or IP# of your machine's Internet connection. Examples include proxy-49.aol.com or 123.243.45.168. 
  * The time and date at which you accessed the information. 
  * The page or materials you are accessing. 
  * The referring link you followed to get to the current page. 
  * The type of browser and computer operating system that you use. 
  * Any errors generated due to broken links or potential software errors. 

We use this information in the following manner: 
  * Generate [monthly statistics](https://web.archive.org/stats/) regarding traffic and usage, which may be included in proposals to obtain funding for MadSci Network so we may keep it a free service. 
  * Identify mistakes in files or trouble-shoot errors. 
  * Identify high-usage materials that may be developed further to provide additional, useful information. 
  * Assist with the recruitment of scientists and moderators to review and answer questions in high volume categories. 
  * Make certain our materials and interfaces are accessible to the platforms and browsers used by visitors. 
  * In addition, we may opt to supply this information to a user's identified Internet Service Provider concerning any user who abuses or attempts to interfere with the functioning of our site. 
  * Beyond these points, MadSci does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer personal information concerning visitors to our website unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required by law. 

In addition, many pages on our site link to [Google's web search](http://www.google.com/) for non-profit organizations. These search results are delivered by the site google.com, and will redirect you to content on madsci.org unless you select the option on Google's query form to search the entire WWW. MadSci.org is not responsible for content located on other websites. 

Please read [Google's Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html) for how these transactions are handled. 

### Asking Questions

For individuals asking questions, we may record the following information: 

  * A subject line and area of science must be entered on the form. 
  * The following information is optional and not required to ask a question: 
    * A first name 
    * Email address 
    * School or affiliated institution. 
    * Location 
    * Grade, or educational level. 
If included, all components except the email address may be made publiclly available in our online archives. Again, if you do not wish this information to be publically accessible, please do not fill in these areas. 

MadSci Network participates in the [Virtual Reference Desk](http://www.vrd.org/) (VRD), an organization of volunteer librarians who assist Internet patrons. MadSci forwards occasional questions to the VRD, particularly those asking about where to find information, how to use a library, or covering non-science topics. The information you provide on our [question form](https://web.archive.org/ask.html) will be forwarded to the VRD. 

Information submitted on the ask-a-question form may be used in the following manner(s): 

  * Track the number of questions submitted in individual subjects. This information helps us determine when we need to recruit additional scientists to field questions, or whether specific subjects should be added or removed from our existing list. 
  * Perform analyses regarding the educational level of students submitting questions, and types of questions received. 
  * Identify commonly asked questions, and create Frequently-Asked-Question files (FAQs) to address them. 
  * We will also use this information to trouble-shoot errors or problems in our interfaces. 
  * In addition, we may opt to supply this information to a user's identified Internet Service Provider concerning any user who abuses our interfaces or who submits materials that are rude, obnoxious, that contain expletives, or threats of any sort. 
  * Beyond these points, MadSci does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer personal information concerning visitors to our website unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required by law.
