At Mad Mimi, protecting your privacy and the privacy of anyone receiving your email is very important. These policies are for the purpose of making Mad Mimi safe and appropriate for all.

To send an email to someone using Mad Mimi, that recipient must be either someone who is a customer, member or subscriber of your business or organization or who has specifically asked to receive your emails by opting in or signing up in some way, or someone who has bought a product or service from you in the past 18 months.

#### Protecting your customer lists and data

Although we reserve the right to monitor your lists, content and response data from time to time to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use, we will never share, sell or rent your customer data to anyone for any reason.
