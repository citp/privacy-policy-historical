# Privacy | Madison Logic

**_Effective as of October 2nd, 2013_**

**Overview**

Madison Logic, Inc., its subsidiaries, partners and affiliates (collectively, “Madison Logic”, or “we”, “us”, “our”) respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy details the information we may collect through registration forms, resource libraries, advertising units, widgets, web sites and web pages, whether accessed via computer, mobile or tablet device, or other technology (collectively, the “Service”), collection and licensing of data through third parties we work with, and how such information may be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it, and your choices in controlling its use in connection with our marketing activities.

**Data Collection**

Our purpose in collecting information is to help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about special offers and promotions, or other relevant content delivered through targeted advertising. We will not willfully disclose any identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your explicit permission, as explained in this privacy statement.

Madison Logic may use a variety of technologies, including [“cookies”](https://web.archive.org/privacy/#anchor) that automatically or passively collect information from your computer, mobile device or other technology when you are visiting a Madison Logic or partner website or on a 3rd party’s behalf when we serve advertisements. Information collected may include data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, your responses to advertisements delivered by us, date and time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests (“Usage Information”). This information may be associated with anonymous business profile information about you, such as your industry, company size, and job title. The purpose of this information is to keep the Service updated and interesting to our users and tailor content to each individual’s interests. Madison Logic does not use this information to discern your identity or to disclose your identity to any 3rd party.

You may elect to Opt Out of Usage Information collection [here.](https://web.archive.org/privacy/#tab-1380136766-2-91)

We do not collect the following information that identifies you: your name, address, email address, and telephone number (“Personal Information”) unless you choose to provide it to us – for example, by submitting a registration form in order to access free content. We may also receive this information when you provide it to a business partner of ours.  We may receive business profile information about you, such as your industry, company size and job title from other sources, and add it to the information you provided to us. If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it. In order to ensure the safekeeping of your Personal Information, Madison Logic stores this data in a separate database from any Usage Information.  You may elect to Opt Out from your personal profile [here.](https://web.archive.org/privacy/#tab-1380136766-2-91)

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s device containing information about the user. We may use cookies to reduce registration fields so that you can receive free content more easily, deliver targeted advertising, or understand your interests and focus areas of research. We believe this enables us to provide users with a more meaningful online experience.

**Disabling Cookies**

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can:

  * change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or
  * set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies



Please note, however, that cookies are used for a variety of reasons, not just marketing-related, so this may adversely impact your online experience.

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

Madison Logic may use the information we obtain, license and collect about and from you for a number of business purposes, including for example, to: better tailor website and promotional content to visitor interests; verify your profile information; deliver targeted advertising; inform our partners of your business-related interests; improve the Service for internal business purposes; help our advertising partners better understand the audience they are reaching; and for purposes we disclose at the time you provide your Personal Information.

**Sharing of Information**

Except as denoted in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any partners or third parties without your consent. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregated demographics, user statistics, interest categories, and Usage Information with third parties. We may combine your Usage Information with those of other users of the Service in order to share trend information with third parties, always in aggregated and anonymous form. We may aggregate Usage Information associated with your Personal Information into business-related research events, which include the form of engagement and content type, topics derived from the content of the event, and date/timestamp of when the event occurred, always in anonymous form. An interest event may be, for example, the downloading of a whitepaper on cloud computing, or clicking on an advertisement related to SSL certificates.

**Advertising / Behavioral Targeting; How to Opt-Out**

If you wish to opt out of our Service, please go to our opt-out page.

We may use third party vendors to enhance the Service (e.g. for purposes of retargeting). We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but they may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device and they may otherwise collect or have access to anonymous Usage Information.

When you opt out of the Service, Madison Logic will no longer use or share any of your Personal or anonymous Usage Information, unless you recently submitted Personal Information (within last 30 days) in order to access free content, in which case only the Content Provider associated with the content you recently acquired will have access to your information.

When you opt out of the Service, we place a cookie on or otherwise identify your browser or device (and/or employ similar technology) to prevent future collection of Usage Information. Opting out of the Service is not the same as blocking cookies. When you opt out of Madison Logic’s Service, we will place a special Madison Logic cookie on (or otherwise identify) your device or browser in a way that informs our systems not to record information related to your business research activities. If you browse the web from multiple devices or browsers, you will need to opt out from each device or browser to ensure that we prevent personalization tracking on all of them. For the same reason, if you procure a new device, change browsers or delete the Madison Logic opt out cookie (or clear all cookies), you will need to perform this opt-out task again.

**Updating Personal Information**

If you wish to verify, correct, or update your Personal Information collected through the Service, you may contact us at the address or email found at the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/privacy/#anchor2) section of this Privacy Policy. In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Service. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide the Service, contact us at privacy@madisonlogic.com.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.

**Data Security Precautions & Retention **

Madison Logic takes precautions to protect data and information under its control from misuse, loss or alteration. Madison Logic’s security measures include industry-standard technology and equipment to help protect your information, and Madison Logic maintains security measures to allow only the appropriate personnel and contractors access to your information. Unfortunately, no system can ensure complete security, and Madison Logic disclaims any liability resulting from use of the Service or from third party hacking events or intrusions.

Usage Information is retained for up to 13 months from the date of collection, after which the data will be de-identified and aggregated for research and analytics; Personal Information is retained for up to 5-years since the last registration date; cookies expire 18 months after their last update.

**Other Web Sites**

The Service may contain links to, or integrations with other sites that Madison Logic does not own or operate. This includes links from customers and partners that may use the Madison Logic logo in a co-branding agreement, or websites and web services that we work with in order to provide the Service. Madison Logic does not control, nor is Madison Logic responsible for these sites or services, or their content, products, services, privacy policies or practices. If you submit Personal Information on a  web site using the Service, you are choosing to disclose information to both Madison Logic and the third party with whose brand the website is associated. This Privacy Policy only governs Madison Logic’s use of your information. The third party’s use of that Personal Information is governed by the partner’s privacy policy, and not by this Privacy Policy.

**Business Sale**

As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, or a sale of our significant assets, we reserve the right to include any information we have among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.

**Children**

Madison Logic does not knowingly collect Personal or Usage Information from children under the age of 13 through http://www.madisonlogic.com, nor from any of our affiliates and partners. If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information, and do not provide Personal Information to any website or web service without consulting your parent or guardian.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Madison Logic, please contact us, and we will seek to delete that information from our database.

**Consent to Processing and Transfer of Information**

The Service and the servers and facilities that maintain the data we hold, are operated in the United States. Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Service, or providing us with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**

Please note, we may modify information presented via the Service and/or this Privacy Policy from time to time without prior notice to you, and any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically revisit the Madison Logic Privacy Policy to see if it has been updated. We will always show the date of the latest modification date of the Privacy Policy at the top of the page so you can tell when it has last been revised.

We regularly review our compliance with this Privacy Policy. Questions, comments and requests regarding this Privacy Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to: [privacy@madisonlogic.com](mailto:privacy@madisonlogic.com) or by mail to 257 Park Avenue South, 5th Floor, NY, NY 10010
