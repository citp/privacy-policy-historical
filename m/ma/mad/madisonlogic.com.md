# Privacy – Madison Logic

## ****Privacy Policy****

_Updated, November 18, 2016._

**Overview**

Madison Logic, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Madison Logic”, or “we”, “us”, “our”) respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy details the information we may collect through registration forms, resource libraries, advertising units, widgets, web sites and web pages, whether accessed via computer, mobile or tablet device, or other technology (collectively, the “Platform”), collection and licensing of data through third parties we work with, and how such information may be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it, and your choices in controlling its use in connection with our marketing activities.

**Data Collection**

Our purpose in collecting information is to help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about special offers and promotions, or other relevant content delivered through targeted advertising. We will not willfully disclose any identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your explicit permission, as explained in this privacy statement.

We collect the following information that identifies you: your name, address, email address, and telephone number (“Personal Information”) when you choose to provide it to us for example, by submitting a registration form in order to access free content. We may also receive this information when you provide it to a business partner of ours. We may receive business profile information about you, such as your industry, company size and job title from other sources, and add it to the information we hold about you. This helps us to promote content that is relevant to you and as described below. If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it. Madison Logic stores Personal Information in a separate database from any Usage Information.

The madisonlogic.com website may also collect another recipient’s email address to help you to initiate and email the recipient you have selected, when you forward a position to them in our careers pages. The recipient may contact us at [privacy@madisonlogic.com](mailto:privacy@madisonlogic.com) to request that we remove this information.

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

Madison Logic may use the information we obtain, license and collect about and from you for a number of business purposes, including for example, to: better tailor website and promotional content to visitor interests; verify your profile information; deliver targeted advertising; inform our partners and Clients of your business-related interests; improve the Platform for internal business purposes; help our advertising partners and Clients better understand the audience they are reaching; and for purposes we disclose at the time you provide your Personal Information.

**Cookies / Tracking Technologies**

We Madison Logic and our publishing partners, Clients, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer websites, track users’ movements around websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.  As to information submitted to, through or on our website, we may likewise use service providers to host content, host or implement blogs and forums, or conduct data and marketing analytics with respect to information captured.

Madison Logic may use a variety of technologies, including [“cookies”](http://www.madisonlogic.com/privacy/#anchor) that automatically or passively collect information from your computer, mobile device or other technology when you are visiting a Madison Logic or partner or Client website or on a 3rd party’s behalf when we serve advertisements and store it in log files. Information collected may include data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, your responses to advertisements delivered by us, date and time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests (“Usage Information”). This information may be associated with anonymous business profile information about you, such as your industry, company size, and job title. The purpose of this information is to keep the Platform updated and interesting to our users and tailor content to each individual’s interests. Madison Logic does not use this information to discern your identity or to disclose your identity to any 3rd party.

You may [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) to opt out of certain cookie-based ad targeting facilitated by Madison Logic current partners. This link will take you to the NAI’s industry opt-out page where you will be able to opt-out from Interest-Based Advertising from Madison Logic and other NAI members.

Please note: This opt-out relies on a cookie, so if you wipe all your cookies, we will no longer know that you have opted out.

A cookie is a small file stored on a user’s device containing information about the user. We may use cookies to reduce or pre-populate registration fields so that you can receive free content more easily, deliver targeted advertising, or understand your interests and focus areas of research. We believe this enables us to provide users with a more meaningful online experience.

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and store information. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:

**Advertising / Behavioral Targeting; How to Opt-Out**

If you wish to opt out of certain cookie-based ad targeting facilitated by current partners of our Platform, please visit this [opt-out page](http://www.madisonlogic.com/optout-2/).

We may use third party vendors to enhance the Platform (e.g. for purposes of retargeting). We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but they may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device and they may otherwise collect or have access to anonymous Usage Information.

When you use the opt-out mechanism above, Madison Logic will no longer use or share any of your Personal or anonymous Usage Information, unless you recently submitted Personal Information (within last 30 days) in order to access free content, in which case only the Content Provider associated with the content you recently acquired will have access to your information.

When you opt out of the Platform, we place a cookie on or otherwise identify your browser or device (and/or employ similar technology) to prevent future collection of Usage Information. Opting out of the Platform is not the same as blocking cookies. When you opt out of Madison Logic’s Platform, we will place a special Madison Logic cookie on (or otherwise identify) your device or browser in a way that informs our systems not to record information related to your business research activities. If you browse the web from multiple devices or browsers, you will need to opt out from each device or browser to ensure that we prevent personalization tracking on all of them. For the same reason, if you procure a new device, change browsers or delete the Madison Logic opt out cookie (or clear all cookies), you will need to perform this opt-out task again.

**Disabling Cookies**

If you would prefer not to accept certain cookies, you may be able to do the following, with your browser:

  * change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or
  * set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies



However, not all browsers offer these features for all types of cookies, and we cannot promise that this technique will work.  Please also note that cookies are used for a variety of reasons, not just marketing-related, so this may adversely impact your online experience.

**Sharing of Information**

Except as denoted in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any partners or other third parties without your consent. We may share Personal Information and Usage information with Clients.  We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregated demographics, user statistics, interest categories, and Usage Information with third parties. We may combine your Usage Information with those of other users of the Platforrm in order to share trend information with third parties, always in aggregated and anonymous form. We may aggregate Usage Information associated with your Personal Information into business-related research events, which include the form of engagement and content type, topics derived from the content of the event, and date/timestamp of when the event occurred, always in anonymous form. An interest event may be, for example, the downloading of a whitepaper on cloud computing, or clicking on an advertisement related to SSL certificates.  We may share any type of information with companies that assist us in operating our business or providing our services such as our blog and career pages.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

**Updating Personal Information**

Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information, to the extent required by our participation in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or other applicable legal requirements.  To request this information please contact us at [privacy@madisonlogic.com](mailto:privacy@madisonlogic.com).

If you wish to verify, correct, or update your Personal Information collected through the Platform, you may contact us at [privacy@madisonlogic.com](mailto:privacy@madisonlogic.com) or by mail to 257 Park Avenue South, 5th Floor, NY, NY 10010. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Platform. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Platform. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide the Platform, contact us at [privacy@madisonlogic.com](mailto:privacy@madisonlogic.com).  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.

**Data Security Precautions & Retention**

Madison Logic takes precautions to protect data and information under its control from misuse, loss or alteration. Madison Logic’s security measures include industry-standard technology and equipment to help protect your information, and Madison Logic maintains security measures to allow only the appropriate personnel and contractors access to your information. Unfortunately, no system can ensure complete security, and Madison Logic disclaims any liability resulting from use of the Platform or from third party hacking events or intrusions.

Usage Information is retained for up to 13 months from the date of collection, after which the data will be de-identified and aggregated for research and analytics; Personal Information from registrations is retained for up to 5-years since the last registration date; cookies expire 18 months after their last update.

**Other Web Sites**

The Platform may contain links to, or integrations with other sites that Madison Logic does not own or operate. This includes links from Clients and partners that may use the Madison Logic logo in a co-branding agreement, or websites and web services that we work with in order to provide the Platform. Madison Logic does not control, nor is Madison Logic responsible for these sites or services, or their content, products, services, privacy policies or practices. If you submit Personal Information on a web site using the Platform, you are choosing to disclose information to both Madison Logic and the third party with whose brand the website is associated. This Privacy Policy only governs Madison Logic’s use of your information. The third party’s use of that Personal Information is governed by the third party’s privacy policy and practices, and not by this Privacy Policy.

**Business Sale**

As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, or a sale of our significant assets, we reserve the right to include any information we have among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.

**Children**

Madison Logic does not knowingly collect Personal or Usage Information from children under the age of 13 through http://www.madisonlogic.com, nor from any of our affiliates and partners. If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information, and do not provide Personal Information to any website or web service without consulting your parent or guardian. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Madison Logic, please contact us, and we will seek to delete that information from our database.

**Consent to Processing and Transfer of Information**

The Platform and the servers and facilities that maintain the data we hold, are operated in the United States and other countries outside yours. Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Platform, or providing us with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.

However, effective as of the date our certification is posted [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list), Madison Logic Inc. participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  Madison Logic is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles, and to complying with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of the personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Madison Logic is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, Madison Logic may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint>], you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

If you have any inquiries or complaints about Madison Logic, Inc.’s handling of your personal data under Privacy Shield, or about our privacy practices generally, please contact us at: [privacy@madisonlogic.com](mailto:privacy@madisonlogic.com). We will respond to your inquiry promptly. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve any complaint relating to the Privacy Shield, or if we fail to acknowledge your complaint in a timely fashion, you can submit your complaint at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>, which provides an independent third-party dispute resolution service based in the United States. If neither Madison Logic, Inc. nor our third-party dispute resolution resolves your complaint, you may pursue binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.

When Madison Logic, Inc. receives information and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on Madison Logic, Inc.’s behalf, Madison Logic, Inc. has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) Madison Logic, Inc. is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage under the Privacy Shield.
