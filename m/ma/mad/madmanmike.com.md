# Privacy Policy

Mike's DJ Service is available only in Michigan USA

**Mike's Privacy Policy**

**DJ Service:** all information is kept confidential, not sold nor given to third parties. Private information including "where you live" and e-mail addresses are not shared with anyone.

If there are celebrities or VIPs at events for which Mike is the DJ, their information is also kept confidential. Everybody's info and everything that happens at those events is kept confidential before, during _AND_ after.

**Online Transactions:** for this website, these are done using PayPal or other verified secure services. Mike does not see credit card or bank account numbers. Information such as mailing and e-mail addresses are kept confidential, not sold nor given to third parties.

If using different websites (such as Mike's resources links), Mike does not see nor collect personal information that people may supply and he is not responsible for other websites privacy policies.

**Hidden Pop-Ups/Pop-Unders:** None. This website does not use them. As a matter of fact, there are NO advertising pop-ups/unders of any kind on this site!

**E-mail Lists and Spam**

This website is passionately anti-spam. Mike does not automatically collect and add e-mail addresses to any e-mailing lists, his or others. His private lists are never made available to anyone else and he does not purchase addresses from third parties.

If you have received spam from Mike's e-mail addresses, it wasn't from Mike. It was some lowlife "phishing" (fraudulently using, stealing) Mike's e-mail address. Mike himself is being spammed by his own e-mail addresses! He would definitely appreciate the prosecution of those who are doing this.

Mike is working with his website hosting service to track down people using his e-mail addresses to spam. If you can save the full headers of spam e-mail, send them to the [Federal Trade Commission Spam Division](http://www.ftc.gov/spam/) \- the FTC, part of the U.S. Government.

**The Bottom Line:** Information you give to Mike, stays with Mike.
