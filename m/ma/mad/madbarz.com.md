## Principle of anonymous data use

In principal, Madbarz website can be used without providing personal data, while our App requires registration. 

When you access our website, some information, such as IP address, is transferred. You are also providing information about the terminal device used (PC, smartphone, tablet, etc.), the browser used (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.), time of visit to the website, the so-called referrer and quantity of data transferred. 

We cannot use these data to identify an individual user. We only use this information to determine how attractive our offer is and to improve its performance or contents, if necessary, and make its design even more appealing to you.

However, in the case of static IP address, personal identification is possible by RIPE query in individual cases, although we do not perform this. 

Nevertheless, Madbarz website is accessible for both static and dynamic IP addresses assigned.

## Personal data

“Personal data” are details of personal or material circumstances regarding a specific or identifiable natural person. 

These include, for example; your real name, address, phone number or date of birth.

## Collecting and processing personal data

Personal data are collected by us, only if you supply them to us, for example when you contact us, in particular by registering a Madbarz account, placing an order, requesting information or publishing personal data in Madbarz app in your profile or in the feed.

## Registration of your Madbarz account

In order to experience the full Madbarz experience, we require you to register. We collect information from you when you register on our Service. 

Providing this information allows you to subscribe to our Premium services, buy our digital products and use our App freely.

We require the following data for registration:

  * Name 
  * E-mail address
  * Password
  * Country
  * Gender

  * Fitness level

When using the Service, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your mailing address, photo, phone number or credit card information. 

As a part of the Service we also might collect personal information about your exercise routines, diet, fitness and health status. The information is used as an essential part of the Service. 

We also reserve the right to ban your profile in case of any violations to our term of service.

Further, we offer you the possibility to create your Madbarz account via your Facebook account. You can register or log in with us by your Facebook account, if you simply use the Facebook button when registering your Madbarz account. You will then be directed to the Facebook page (where you must log in or you need to have an account) and you will be told which data on Facebook we need from you, that is, first of all, your public profile information, such as name, surname, gender and e-mail address which you have saved there. This is necessary for identification, so that a secure Madbarz account can be created for you. Your Facebook profile and your Madbarz account are permanently linked by the e-mail address. We save your email data here and we will contact you at this address with information, if necessary. We also take note of your registration with us via Facebook. As soon as you log in to Facebook, you can also log in with us. Without your consent, we will not forward any of your data to Facebook. 

Important: We do not find out your Facebook access data at any point and we have no possibility to post anything on your Facebook profile, without it having been approved by you separately. You can find out how Facebook handles privacy settings by consulting the Facebook Data Protection Policy (https://www.facebook.com/policy.php) and Terms and Conditions of Use (https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms); there you will also find the valid provisions for all above-mentioned possibilities of logging in and registering with us. 

##  What do we use your information for? 

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

  * To personalize your experience (Your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs) 
  * To improve our website and app (We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you) 
  * To improve customer service (Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)
  * To process transactions (Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.) 
  * To send periodic emails (The email address you provide may be used to send you information, newsletter, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.)
  * To tailor our advertising efforts to best suit your interests 



Note that when you share and communicate using our products and/or services (i.e. participate in discussions, respect and comment on other users’ workouts, etc.), the information you provide in that manner on our site and app will be publicly available to all other users of our services. In some cases, people you share and communicate with may download and/or re-share this content with others on and off our services.

## Data collection, processing and use within Madbarz ecosystem

#### General Use

To use our Madbarz App or advanced website features, you must have a Madbarz account. You have already found out above what data are collected for this purpose. To provide you with the best Madbarz experience possible, our approach is partly based on publishing specific information of our users, i.e. even your information. 

This introduction includes the following information, in particular: 

  * public profile (photo, name, surname, training location, motivation) 
  * condition (estimated fitness level, desired objective) 
  * training information (period and type of training, total number of training sessions, photo)
  * followed by/follows (person who follows the user, person followed by the user) 



You become visible in Madbarz App with the data in your public profile. This information helps other users to find you in Madbarz App. At the same time, other users can see your name and surname (if provided), your published workouts, and your profile photo, and they can recognise you by this information, if necessary. 

Madbarz app will save all your successfully completed workouts, as well as related information, such as self-uploaded photos or comments. 

Other users can see these data and can consider them as incentive for themselves, leave comments or decide whether they want to follow you.

Moreover, our app also provides the users with the possibility to be followed ("Followed by") to support or encourage them in their training experience, or to compete with one another. For this purpose, users can be searched for by the name registered in the public profile, and if connected to your Facebook profile, your friends will be presented to you via suggestions. 

You will be notified about new followers on the website or mobile App by push message. Thus, some of your information is also available to other users in Madbarz App, irrespective of whether it is accessed on the website or in the relevant mobile Apps. 

If you do not want to make it possible to link your performance to yourself, you are free to refrain from providing any personal data on your profile or training sessions and linking your account to Facebook. Moreover, you should not save any training photos. 

For this reason, we have ensured that each user can change their personal information which can be viewed by other users and each user is free to use their own name or a fictitious name. 

### Madbarz Premium

If you bought Madbarz Premium, you will receive access to our Workout Programs, tailored by your provided fitness level and preferences.

If you have sustained a serious injury and therefore cannot do any training now, you can suspend your subscription for the period of your injury. For this purpose, you can notify our support team about your injury on a voluntary basis. The support team will only process the information, which subsequently becomes anonymous, as the basis for the relevant suspension of Madbarz premium.

### Access Rights

We need these access options and information to ensure the technical functioning of our App and provision of the services offered with the App, in particular to be able to access your camera or your photos, to determine your activity or to send you push messages to inform you about new followers or comments. During the installation procedure or before you use the App for the first time, we request permission to access individual functions and information. We only access these functions if you give us your approval. You can manually revoke the access rights in the settings for each operating system. You can find out how this works in the manufacturer instructions for your mobile OS. However, please note that you can use the App only to a limited extent or you cannot use it at all without the relevant approval.

Before you use the App for the first time, we will request the following rights for the purpose described below:

  * Photo library - selection of photos for profile/feed
  * Push messages - variety of notifications
  * Mobile data/WLAN - use of internet and downloading of content

###  Google Analytics 

Madbarz App and Website both use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses the so-called "cookies". The information about your use of this website generated by cookies is usually forwarded to and saved on a Google server in the USA. However, due to activating IP anonymisation on this website, your IP address is shortened beforehand by Google in member states of the European Union or other states which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. 

Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address forwarded to a Google server in the USA, and shortened there. On behalf of the providers of this website, Google uses this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports about the website activities and supply other services related to the website use and internet use to the website provider. 

The IP address transferred from your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not combined with other Google data. You can prevent the cookies from being saved by the relevant settings of your browser software.

In principle, a non-reversible and not personal hash total (hash value) from your use data is generated in the process, which can be transferred to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. A Facebook tracking pixel is also set up on our website to this end. Information about your activities on the website (e.g. surfing behaviour, sub-pages visited, etc.) is collected in the process.
