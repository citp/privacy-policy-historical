This Privacy Policy describes how J.Crew Group, Inc., 770 Broadway, New York NY 10003, USA and our brands and subsidiaries (including but not limited to J.Crew, crewcuts, J.Crew Factory, J.Crew Mercantile and Madewell) (collectively, “J.Crew,” “we” or “us”) collect, use and share information about you and the choices that are available to you with respect to our handling of your data. This policy applies to information we collect when you interact with us online (e.g., through our website or other online products and services) or offline (e.g., when you shop in our stores or interact with customer support) or otherwise interact with us as described below. Our online and offline services and interactions with you are collectively referred to as “Services” in this Privacy Policy.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy. In some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the homepages of our websites or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

## COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

We collect information you provide directly to us.

In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you purchase a gift card for someone and request that we deliver it electronically, create and share a “wishlist” or decide to purchase and ship products to someone. We will use this information to fulfill your requests and will not send marketing communications to your contacts unless they separately opt in to receive communications from us.

We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving our websites and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our sites are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked and for other internal business purposes. For more information about how we use cookies, please see the [cookie policy](https://www.madewell.com/cookie-policy.html).



**Information We Collect from Our Partners and Other Sources** We may obtain information about you from other sources and combine that with information we collect about you.

**Cookies**   
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our websites. For more information, please see the cookie policy.

**Data Transfers and Privacy Shield**   
J.Crew has operations in the U.S. and other countries. As such, we or our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.   
When we transfer personal data from the European Union (“EU Data”) to the U.S., we adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles of notice; choice; onward transfer; security; data integrity and purpose limitation; access; and recourse, enforcement and liability designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission (the “Principles”). For more information about J.Crew’s certification and the Principles, please visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website <https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome>.   
Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS (<https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield>), our designated Privacy Shield dispute resolution provider. Under certain conditions specified by the Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. J.Crew is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC. If J.Crew shares EU Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing of EU Data in violation of the Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

**Customers Who Are Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”)**

  * **J.Crew Entity Responsible for Your Information**

If you are a resident of the United Kingdom, J.Crew U.K. Limited and J.Crew Group Inc. provide our Services to you and are responsible for your information when you use our Services.

    * As necessary for our legitimate interests, including our interest in providing relevant and secure Services, and improving our Services and products;
    * As necessary to comply with our legal obligations; or
    * As consistent with your consent, which you may revoke at any time.
